Just one point, and that is that the... a settlement of this type, which basically goes to the quantum of damages that were awarded for the antitrust violation, essentially buys out the adversarial interest, or incentive of the other party and allows through the settlement a claim such as the trade dress claim, which would be the subject of defensive nonmutual collateral estoppel, an asserted right by the party that lost, to be resuscitated just for the payment of enough money to satisfy the other party, and the only real interested parties who would be adversaries are the parties like Sears and Izumi, who are directly affected, and have already been shown to be affected, in the other litigation where that trade dress claim, once dead, has now come back to life, and that's why we say the vacatur on settlement rule completely undermines and is very much inconsistent with collateral estoppel, and the rule should be consistent. Thank you very much.","start":2860.236,"stop":2860.236,"duration":0}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Mintz.
