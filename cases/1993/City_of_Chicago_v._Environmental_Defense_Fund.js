a provision saying ash is not, then at most, it seems to me, you can get by plain language is that you don't treat the ash as hazardous waste until it leaves the hands of the recovery facility, but at

the only defendant in this case is the resource recovery facility, because I take it even EDF doesn't think that Congress intended to create an exemption where if the resource recovery facility

that would trigger a different result.","start":405.23,"stop":430.268,"duration":25.04},{"text":"EDF apparently doesn't even think that distinction makes any sense, and I think especially when you put the plain language into the regulatory context, it becomes quite clear, because when EPA defined by regulation what was hazardous in 1980, it bowed to the practical
