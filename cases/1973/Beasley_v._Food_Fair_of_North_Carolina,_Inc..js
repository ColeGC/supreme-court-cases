preempted from any state control.","start":428.451,"stop":450.151,"duration":21.7},{"text":"But in that case and then the Hanna case mentions that there may be some other areas in which it may be

preemption.”","start":492.08,"stop":521.174,"duration":29.09},{"text":"Now it is right there if the Court please that the appellant plaintiff in this case rests its position.","start":521.174,"stop":530.557,"duration":9.38},{"text":"In the Hanna case, the Court dealt with a situation where some supervisory engineers were attempting to picket, to obtain a

majority.”","start":543.557,"stop":548.131,"duration":4.57},{"text":"It did not take really the position that was ended up to start with but in that situation the Hanna engineers were doing exactly what the last part of Section 14 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act says says “it cannot do.”","start":548.131,"stop":565.273,"duration":17.14},{"text":"In other words that it cannot, no employer said that this Act shall be compelled to treat supervisors as employees for the purpose of collective bargaining.","start":565.273,"stop":575.669,"duration":10.4},{"text":"And the Hanna Engineers were simply trying to get this employer to do exactly that.","start":575.669,"stop":581.238,"duration":5.57},{"text":"Well, in the Hanna case, the Court mentions that it’s not dealing in that case with the situation where a person could become a supervisor and be fired for being a union member.","start":581.238,"stop":594.475,"duration":13.24},{"text":"It says it’s not -- specifically not dealing with

that in light of Hanna, the Hanna case and in light of the statement in the Morton case explaining what is and what isn’t preempted that the activity of these three individuals who signed membership
