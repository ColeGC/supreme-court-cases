to declare that persons who have failed to report for induction following the declaration of delinquency are constitutionally immune from punishment, and that any acts which they may have committed may be susceptible to other kinds of criminal enforcement, but not susceptible to this kind of criminal enforcement because it has never been authorized by the only body under Article I, Section 1
