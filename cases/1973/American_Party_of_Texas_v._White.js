Texas.","start":124.836,"stop":133.354,"duration":8.52},{"text":"The first exclusion is based on a difference of opinion with political philosophy.","start":133.354,"stop":139.496,"duration":6.14},{"text":"You either join up with the republican and democrat parties in Texas or you are actually excluded, practically excluded from the

practice the philosophy which you believe and to associate and organize political parties for that purpose.","start":149.582,"stop":167.187,"duration":17.61},{"text":"Once you have participated in the party primary, you are locked in to that particular party.","start":167.187,"stop":172.569,"duration":5.38},{"text":"Actually, voting in a party primary constitutes registration in the State of Texas.","start":172.569,"stop":178.834,"duration":6.27},{"text":"Not only from the standpoint of our continuous registration which we now have but also from party

have not found one.","start":222.921,"stop":224.116,"duration":1.2},{"text":"I found one particular case this Court had decided in McDonald from the Illinois case but that -- in that one, the absentee privilege is restricted to those who were confined in institutions even though they might just have been under charges and have not been convicted.","start":224.116,"stop":242.314,"duration":18.2},{"text":"I find it little bit harsh to compare the minority parties in Texas to the inmates of penal institutions in other States.","start":242.314,"stop":250.938,"duration":8.62},{"text":"The added bonus which we have in Texas since the 1971 McKool-Stroud Primary Financing Law which is also part of this appeal is the fact that if you participate in the Republican and the Democrat Primary, you get the bonus of having a tax paid for a primary.","start":250.938,"stop":271.323,"duration":20.38},{"text":"If on contrast if you should determine to participate with one of the minority parties, then you are compelled to pay all of these expenses out of the minority party account.","start":271.323,"stop":282.808,"duration":11.49},{"text":"There are no write-ins in the primaries in Texas since the original time of the rise of the Republican Party in Texas which used to nominate by write-ins in the primary so they exclude the write-ins from primaries when that party started growing up.","start":282.808,"stop":298.852,"duration":16.04},{"text":"Actually, the nomination for local offices in Texas by the Democrat Primary as a practical exercise is determity participation because nomination for most offices in Texas by the Democrat Primary is tantamount to election.","start":298.852,"stop":317.01,"duration":18.16},{"text":"The second exclusion from the ballot in Texas is by the numbers of the votes for Governor which were cast for the candidate of that particular political party in the last gubernatorial or general election.","start":317.01,"stop":330.45,"duration":13.44},{"text":"For instance the American Party on 1968 hold 584,000 votes for its nominee for United States President but because the American Party did not have a nominee on the ballot for Governor, it was automatically excluded from the ballot from that time.","start":330.45,"stop":348.712,"duration":18.26},{"text":"The question is, is the numbers of vote gained insofar as the gubernatorial candidate concern, a fairer competition and thus, that fairer competition constitute a compelling state interest.","start":348.712,"stop":361.713,"duration":13},{"text":"We need not speculate what might have happened to our requirement for votes because of what actually did happen in Texas after the La Raza Unida candidate secured the necessary signatures and attained ballot position in the 1972 Primary.","start":361.713,"stop":379.215,"duration":17.5},{"text":"They polled more than 2% of their vote for their gubernatorial candidate in 1972 and consequently they -- the Texas legislature in meeting in its next biennial session raised the quota from 2% to 20% for automatic ballot position from this date.","start":379.215,"stop":399.338,"duration":20.12},{"text":"And so the numbers gained does prevail in Texas and if one minority party happens to fulfill the requirements of that then law, then they’ll change the law again.","start":399.338,"stop":410.311,"duration":10.97},{"text":"And actually, that was the difference that was made in the law in this 1345 subdivision (2) after the 1968 campaign.","start":410.311,"stop":418.668,"duration":8.36},{"text":"When the American Party started to where it said there is a competitive factor in Texas and so the law was changed and so we got this Honors petitions which we are now required to circulate.","start":418.668,"stop":431.499,"duration":12.83},{"text":"This is the basis of the third exclusion from the ballot in Texas.","start":431.499,"stop":436.411,"duration":4.91},{"text":"If the gubernatorial candidate did not receive 2% of the vote which is now been raised to 20% of the vote in the last general election, you have to go out and start the petition route again.","start":436.411,"stop":449.415,"duration":13},{"text":"Of course, this presumes that you had a gubernatorial candidate, it would also include new parties like the Texas New Party and the Texas Socialist Workers Party which did not have a candidate on the ballot of any kind in 1970 and was not organized on a statewide basis.","start":449.415,"stop":468.166,"duration":18.75},{"text":"We have

ballot.","start":485.569,"stop":490.05,"duration":4.48},{"text":"By March, the state rules must be filed.","start":490.05,"stop":493.198,"duration":3.15},{"text":"In May, the county precinct conventions must be held at the same time as the party primary conventions are being held and suddenly the whole Texas totalitarian idea takes on the very reflections of Williams versus Rhodes.","start":493.198,"stop":510.949,"duration":17.75},{"text":"The petitions which are required in Texas are statutorily dictated and exacting in wording.","start":510.949,"stop":517.953,"duration":7},{"text":"The wording must be exactly as it is dictated by statute or they are not accepted and filed by the Secretary of State.","start":517.953,"stop":525.475,"duration":7.52},{"text":"The form is dictated, the form of the signature.","start":525.475,"stop":528.757,"duration":3.28},{"text":"Prior to the holding of the precinct conventions through out the 254 counties in Texas in May, there must be printed and circulated these petitions.","start":528.757,"stop":539.957,"duration":11.2},{"text":"This is the first step for qualification for ballot position by the numbers gained in Texas.","start":539.957,"stop":546.518,"duration":6.56},{"text":"They must be circulated, they must be in the hands of this precinct chairman in each of the precincts so they will be available for signature on that day because beginning as of that day, you have a total of 54 days as in 1972, it might be 55 days next year to secure 1% of the total vote for Governor in the proceeding general election to sign this petitions to indicate the support for some candidate who might be running on this minority party ticket.","start":546.518,"stop":582.568,"duration":36.05},{"text":"This number in 1972 with some 22,000 plus signatures in 1974 will be 36,000 plus signatures.","start":582.568,"stop":592.006,"duration":9.44},{"text":"But these petitions is not only must be in this exact form but they must be signed before a notary public and they carry a criminal penalty that you must have -- you must swear that you have not participated in any of the other party primaries in anyway whatsoever.","start":592.006,"stop":610.198,"duration":18.19},{"text":"You have already been excluded from the absentee balloting and it is the contention of the minority parties hereon appeal that certainly if you are to put out a petition after the primary, we should also be accorded the right to compete for those absentee votes and there are many thousands of absentee votes cast in Texas in
