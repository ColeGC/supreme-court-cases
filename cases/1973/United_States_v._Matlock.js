Seventh Circuit placed upon the police the burden of determining whether a person encountered at the door has the authority to consent.","start":523.446,"stop":534.206,"duration":10.76},{"text":"Now we cited numerous cases, and the Government has also.","start":534.206,"stop":537.877,"duration":3.67},{"text":"They rely, for instance, on the Gorg

faith.","start":541.976,"stop":548.764,"duration":6.79},{"text":"They had consent and they had the request of the homeowner to search the house.","start":548.764,"stop":556.457,"duration":7.69},{"text":"The only question in that case was the right of the person who occupied the room, the son in that

the Government also cites Schneckloth.","start":574.037,"stop":578.446,"duration":4.41},{"text":"The only question in Schneckloth was the voluntariness of the consent to search.","start":578.446,"stop":584.337,"duration":5.89},{"text":"They cite Hopper and in that case, the Court never reached the question of actual authority because it ruled that the consenter did not even have apparent authority to consent.","start":584.337,"stop":596.406,"duration":12.07},{"text":"Now, yesterday, the question was asked, Mr. Wallace of whether or not he relied upon Hill and I

Robinson.","start":596.406,"stop":613.873,"duration":17.47},{"text":"Robinson is analogist to Hill in one thing and it's differentiated from Matlock in that, in Hill, the search was incidental to an

bliss.","start":645.877,"stop":652.329,"duration":6.45},{"text":"We cited in our brief at pages 12 and 13 a very short argument in that regard and I said, \"To accept the Government’s apparent authority position would be to assume that ignorance is bliss.","start":652.329,"stop":666.66,"duration":14.33},{"text":"And when it comes to warrantless police searches, the less the officer knows

warrantless search is reasonable if consented to by one who may appear to have authority to consent even if, in fact, he does not have that authority.","start":681.753,"stop":696.029,"duration":14.28},{"text":"Now, Mr. Justice -- Chief Justice Burger came up with the thing that I wish I had thought of and that's mainly the meter reader
