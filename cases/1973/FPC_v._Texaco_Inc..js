for the District of Columbia Circuit.","start":58.737,"stop":63.723,"duration":4.99},{"text":"They concern the validity of certain orders of the Federal Power Commission, adopting a new method of regulating the sales of natural gas producers -- sales by natural -- a class of natural -- small natural gas producers in interstate commerce.","start":63.723,"stop":78.287,"duration":14.56},{"text":"Following my argument on behalf of the Commission, Mr. Vaughan will argue on behalf of the other petitioners for approximately five minutes.","start":78.287,"stop":85.135,"duration":6.85},{"text":"They are among the class of small producers that are affected by the Commission’s orders in this case.","start":85.135,"stop":92.904,"duration":7.77},{"text":"It is now almost universally recognized that we are experiencing an increasingly critical shortage of natural gas.","start":92.904,"stop":99.442,"duration":6.54},{"text":"The orders at issue in this case are part of the Federal Power Commission’s vigorous program for combating that shortage by encouraging new exploration and development of the natural gas reserves in this country.","start":99.442,"stop":112.556,"duration":13.11},{"text":"The orders rest on the Commission’s authority under Section 16 of the Natural Gas Act which gives it the authority to classify persons within its jurisdiction and to prescribe different requirements for different classes.","start":112.556,"stop":125.212,"duration":12.66},{"text":"The class involved here is not a new one.","start":125.212,"stop":127.665,"duration":2.45},{"text":"The Commission has previously given specialized rate treatment to this group of small producers and this Court held in the Permian Basin case that “the problems in public functions of small producers differ sufficiently to permit their separate classification.”","start":127.665,"stop":145.054,"duration":17.39},{"text":"Those problems in public functions were described in some detail in the Permian opinion and the facts are the same today.","start":145.054,"stop":153.31,"duration":8.26},{"text":"Small producers account for only about 10% to 15% of the gas that’s transported in interstate pipelines and their prices generally follow the prices that large producers are able to get for their gas.","start":153.31,"stop":167.166,"duration":13.86},{"text":"But while they contribute only a small portion of the interstate gas, they have traditionally been responsible for about 80% of the exploratory drilling, much of it in the areas that have not previously been explored which makes it a highly risky operation.","start":167.166,"stop":182.271,"duration":15.1},{"text":"The result is as this Court stated in Permian and I quote again, “Their contribution to the search for new gas reserves is significant, but it is made at correspondingly greater financial risks and at higher unit costs.","start":182.271,"stop":196.248,"duration":13.98},{"text":"The principle impediment to the small producers’ exploratory efforts has been a lack of adequate financing.”","start":196.248,"stop":202.865,"duration":6.62},{"text":"The comments submitted to the Commission in this proceeding for example at page 84 of the appendix suggest that small producers must rely principally on revenues from current sales in order to finance their exploratory activities.","start":202.865,"stop":216.42,"duration":13.55},{"text":"That is so because the hazards of their exploration are such that it makes it difficult to depend upon debt financing and because the small producers unlike the large producers seldom have other operations to generate funds that they can use for exploration.","start":216.42,"stop":233.208,"duration":16.79},{"text":"Given this situation, the Commission devised in this rulemaking proceeding, a new regulatory program designed to take advantage of the small producers’ unique situation.","start":233.208,"stop":244.67,"duration":11.46},{"text":"I want to emphasize that that this Court has before it only the orders that would setup a program.","start":244.67,"stop":250.081,"duration":5.41},{"text":"It is not reviewing any order applying this program to the facts of any particular case.","start":250.081,"stop":256.019,"duration":5.94},{"text":"The court’s review consequently is a limited one.","start":256.019,"stop":258.918,"duration":2.9},{"text":"The only question is whether the Act prohibits the Commission from experimenting along the lines that it has chosen to follow.","start":258.918,"stop":265.099,"duration":6.18},{"text":"And this Court has stated on a number of

either.","start":297.798,"stop":301.282,"duration":3.48},{"text":"A similar blanket certificate procedure was established as part of the Permian proceeding and was approved by the Court in principal
