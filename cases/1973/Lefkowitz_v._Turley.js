the interests of the State are both urgent and vital.","start":589.474,"stop":598.858,"duration":9.38},{"text":"In the public contractor and in a public employee situation, it is also clear that a contractor has a higher obligation than the ordinary citizen to provide information with respect at least to the relationship which he has with the State.","start":598.858,"stop":617.348,"duration":18.49},{"text":"If he’s unwilling to provide the information, then the relationship should not

money.","start":624.883,"stop":634.36,"duration":9.48},{"text":"But before that money, and even perhaps public safety will be committed to him, he must be willing to accept certain preventive measures and to cooperate in any necessary detection of wrong doing doing because typically in a situation involving contracts, detection of wrong doing will be difficult.","start":634.36,"stop":655.265,"duration":20.9},{"text":"So then he enters into the special relationship with the State and he agrees that not withstanding any possible consequences, should the time come, he will be open and honest.","start":655.265,"stop":665.59,"duration":10.33},{"text":"Even if it means that the evidence will be used against him and that he will be brought to justice.","start":665.59,"stop":670.482,"duration":4.89},{"text":"Obviously, a principal benefit of this understanding is prevention.","start":670.482,"stop":675.675,"duration":5.19},{"text":"Corruption may well be nipped in the bud.","start":675.675,"stop":679.353,"duration":3.68},{"text":"The public not only is

account.","start":683.569,"stop":686.609,"duration":3.04},{"text":"But the execution of contract is an open book and that the public is not being

follow.","start":698.343,"stop":719.588,"duration":21.25}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"So, he -- So, there is -- if he refuses to sign a contract with that condition in it,

correct.","start":728.11,"stop":729.436,"duration":1.33}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"So, there is a condition or a barrier to doing things with the State which amounts to a
