understand how bond discount works, we believe, is by reference to the prototype transaction set forth in our brief at page 10.","start":385.406,"stop":394.459,"duration":9.05},{"text":"In this prototype transaction, a corporation issues a bond with a face amount of $1,000 bearing stated interest at a rate of 5% over a 10-year term.","start":394.459,"stop":404.942,"duration":10.48},{"text":"The bond is issued for $950.","start":404.942,"stop":408.424,"duration":3.48},{"text":"The stated interest of 5% produces an interest obligation of 5% of $1,000 or $50 a year.","start":408.424,"stop":416.588,"duration":8.16},{"text":"But because the issuer of the bond must pay back to the holder an additional $50 after the bond is retired, that additional $50 is also a cost of borrowing money and, as such, is deductible as interest.","start":416.588,"stop":433.637,"duration":17.05},{"text":"Because it is payable over the term of the bond, this Court and appropriate treasury regulations have permitted a ratable deduction over the term of the bond or amortization, if you will.","start":433.637,"stop":447.88,"duration":14.24},{"text":"Thus, the allowable deduction to the issuer on the prototype bond would be $55 a year and not $50 a year.","start":447.88,"stop":455.881,"duration":8},{"text":"The critical question in this case is whether this transaction is analogous to the prototype transaction.","start":455.881,"stop":462.779,"duration":6.9},{"text":"Here, we have a situation where the corporation issued a $50 debenture in substitution for a share of eliminated $50 par preferred stock.","start":462.779,"stop":473.551,"duration":10.77},{"text":"There’s no question that respondent, upon the original issuance of the preferred stock, received $50 in the corporate teal, so to speak.","start":473.551,"stop":482.046,"duration":8.5},{"text":"It has now transformed that preferred stock investment into a liability which will be payable over an 18-- at the end of 18 years.","start":482.046,"stop":491.557,"duration":9.51},{"text":"It originally received this $50 and it now promises to pay $50 out over the end of the term.","start":491.557,"stop":501.352,"duration":9.79},{"text":"This equivalence has been reflected in the journal entries of respondent which -- for they have reduced their capital account by the $50 par amount for each bond -- for each preferred stock share which has been eliminated and have increased their bonds payable account by a like amount.","start":501.352,"stop":518.36,"duration":17.01},{"text":"This simple substitution of one security for another does not involve an obligation to pay in the future any more than the $50 originally received for the preferred stock.","start":518.36,"stop":529.42,"duration":11.06},{"text":"And, we believe that as a matter of numerical equivalence there can be no discount in such a transaction.","start":529.42,"stop":536.513,"duration":7.09},{"text":"Now, respondent and the Tenth Circuit have focused on these sporadic sales of the preferred shares at $33 a share.","start":536.513,"stop":547.716,"duration":11.2},{"text":"It held that there was $17 of discount on the issuance of each debenture.","start":547.716,"stop":553.269,"duration":5.55},{"text":"But, recalling that discount simply involves an obligation to pay in excess of an amount borrowed just as the corporation in the prototype transaction has promised to pay $1,000 although it has only borrowed $950, we submit that there is no such excess in this case.","start":553.269,"stop":572.805,"duration":19.54},{"text":"For discount to exist in this case, the amount borrowed must be somehow analogous to the $33 in the same way that the $950 in cash is analogous to the amount borrowed in the prototype transaction.","start":572.805,"stop":588.144,"duration":15.34},{"text":"But unlike the prototype transaction where the corporation has fully available $950 of cash for its use in the business, here, all respondent has is a certificate of its preferred stock which is immediately canceled by the terms of the Articles of Incorporation.","start":588.144,"stop":605.33,"duration":17.19},{"text":"Thus, the so-called $33 fair market value of the preferred stock is meaningless to the respondent and in no sense, can it be said to have received $33 in a borrowing transaction.","start":605.33,"stop":620.505,"duration":15.17},{"text":"Now, respondent disputes this analysis.","start":620.505,"stop":623.037,"duration":2.53},{"text":"It argues that it only entered into this transaction because it did not have $33 in cash to redeem its preferred shares.","start":623.037,"stop":631.391,"duration":8.35},{"text":"As a result, it had to issue bonds in the face amount of $50 and the argument goes that the $17 of excess is interest or deductible discount.","start":631.391,"stop":642.583,"duration":11.19},{"text":"It analogizes its preferred shareholders
