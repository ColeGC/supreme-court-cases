Adams","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, I do think the case would be different, because in that case, for example, if he had not claimed as many exemptions as we he was entitled to, the funding question would be similar to a savings account, he would have created a greater tax refund check.","start":287.696,"stop":305.766,"duration":18.07},{"text":"Now, in the -- one of the cases that’s discussed this issue, the Cedor case, the opinion of the Judge in the Northern District of California, specifically held that because that part of the tax refund check was a result of voluntary activity, that it should be regarded as property under the Bankruptcy Act.","start":305.766,"stop":325.184,"duration":19.42},{"text":"In this case, we’re dealing with the tax refund check that was result of no particular voluntary action by the bankrupt, except that he was just complying with the tax laws.","start":325.184,"stop":337.932,"duration":12.75},{"text":"Another important aspect of this asset, an important aspect that was also present in Lines is that the tax refund check is not received until after the bankruptcy.","start":337.932,"stop":349.656,"duration":11.72},{"text":"It is a postbankruptcy event, part of the debtor’s future.","start":349.656,"stop":353.901,"duration":4.25},{"text":"Like vacation pay, it is not particularly reachable or payable to the bankrupt, until the time that it is actually received.","start":353.901,"stop":363.21,"duration":9.31},{"text":"In Mr. Kokoszka’s case, he filed his bankruptcy on January 5, 1972.","start":363.21,"stop":370.697,"duration":7.49},{"text":"He filed his income tax return in February and he received his tax refund check about two months later.","start":370.697,"stop":378.459,"duration":7.76},{"text":"Thus, vacation pay, like the tax refund check importantly is a postbankruptcy event, and part of the debtor’s future, but perhaps the most important aspect of the Lines case is that vacation pay was entirely wages.","start":378.459,"stop":397.846,"duration":19.39},{"text":"In this case, similarly the tax refund check here is derived entirely from wages.","start":397.846,"stop":405.144,"duration":7.3},{"text":"It consists entirely of wages.","start":405.144,"stop":407.858,"duration":2.71},{"text":"The bankrupt has been compelled to accept the delayed receipt of wages, which he otherwise would have received, as a result of the withholding laws of the United States.","start":407.858,"stop":420.021,"duration":12.16},{"text":"But, for the withholding laws, this money would have been available for his use and he would have used it for his support at the time of his regular pay check.","start":420.021,"stop":430.228,"duration":10.21},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit’s decision, the Cedor case and the Eighth Circuit decision, the Gehrig case focused on the practical realities of the importance of wages to a bankrupt.","start":430.228,"stop":443.99,"duration":13.76},{"text":"A bankruptcy, as we point out in our brief and as those courts referred to is frequently a last resort for a debtor.","start":443.99,"stop":451.844,"duration":7.85},{"text":"He has used up all his assets by the time he’s forced to go into bankruptcy.","start":451.844,"stop":457.194,"duration":5.35},{"text":"He depends entirely on his receipt of future wages, in order to make his fresh start.","start":457.194,"stop":463.995,"duration":6.8},{"text":"In Mr. Kokoszka’s case, he earned only $2,400.00 in 1971.","start":463.995,"stop":471.425,"duration":7.43},{"text":"At that level of earning, all of the person’s wages are necessary for items of immediate support and consumption, as this Court noted in the case of James versus Strange.","start":471.425,"stop":483.802,"duration":12.38},{"text":"Additionally, Lines was a confluence of streams of decisional law, both in the Bankruptcy Act and outside of the Bankruptcy Act.","start":483.802,"stop":493.467,"duration":9.66},{"text":"In Lines, the Court quoted and emphasized its holding in Sniadach that wages were specialized kind of property in our system.","start":493.467,"stop":504.211,"duration":10.74},{"text":"Both the Cedor Court and the Gehrig Court felt that given the specialized nature of wages and a condition of the bankrupt that to deprive the bankrupt of his tax refund check would work in equivalent hardship as to deprive him of his vacation pay.","start":504.211,"stop":523.712,"duration":19.5},{"text":"Perhaps the more so, because the debtor has already been forced to accept the delayed payment of these wages, which he needed.","start":523.712,"stop":532.99,"duration":9.28},{"text":"In any event, the contention of the bankrupt in this case is that the tax refund check is as important a part of the family budget, as vacation pay.","start":532.99,"stop":544.284,"duration":11.29},{"text":"Now, the Court below, the Second Circuit did not apply this same analysis and attempted to distinguish Lines versus Frederick in this regard, by claiming that vacation pay was a periodic wage payment, like a person’s regular pay check, whereas this is not.","start":544.284,"stop":564.358,"duration":20.07},{"text":"That Court’s distinction, we submit, is both unrealistic and not in keeping with this Court’s decision in the Lines case.","start":564.358,"stop":573.84,"duration":9.48},{"text":"It is unrealistic because a debtor needs his wages for support, whether they are paid to him on a regular basis or not, they are just as important for his fresh start.","start":573.84,"stop":587.953,"duration":14.11},{"text":"The Second Circuit’s distinction is not consistent with Lines versus Frederick, because in Lines this Court rejected focusing on technical distinctions, such as whether or not the property was paid in a periodic way or not and focused instead on a broader examination and the practical realities to the bankrupt and the relationship of the asset to the debtor’s fresh start.","start":587.953,"stop":614.945,"duration":26.99},{"text":"Another important case, cited by the Court below was Segal versus Rochelle.","start":614.945,"stop":621.032,"duration":6.09},{"text":"That brings us to the question of whether or not this asset is in some way entangled in the debtor’s prebankruptcy past.","start":621.032,"stop":629.584,"duration":8.55},{"text":"The second test, which this Court has emphasized, a bankrupt’s position in this case is that Segal versus Rochelle does not require result contrary to what the bankrupt is urging.","start":629.584,"stop":642.101,"duration":12.52},{"text":"In that case, we dealt with the business bankrupt, who is entitled to receive a loss carry back refund.","start":642.101,"stop":649.128,"duration":7.03},{"text":"As this Court noted in Lines, Segal really wasn’t a fresh start case.","start":649.128,"stop":654.211,"duration":5.08},{"text":"In Segal, a business has ceased to operate, and the job of the trustee was simply to marshal the assets for the benefit of the creditors.","start":654.211,"stop":664.454,"duration":10.24},{"text":"Also, there is not causal link to the prebankruptcy past in this case, as the Court found important in the case of Segal versus Rochelle.","start":664.454,"stop":674.515,"duration":10.06},{"text":"There, the Court noted the peculiar nature of a loss carry back refund check and found that it was the result of those very losses, which had precipitated the bankruptcy.","start":674.515,"stop":688.006,"duration":13.49},{"text":"There is no such problem here.","start":688.006,"stop":690.822,"duration":2.82},{"text":"Thus, to summarize this part of the bankrupt’s position, we contend that Lines requires the Court in examining the definition of the meaning of the word “property” focus on practical realities and to analyze the relationship of the asset to the debtor’s fresh start.","start":690.822,"stop":712.566,"duration":21.74},{"text":"Lines marked the rejection of more mechanical approach to defining property, by focusing on whether or not when it was earned, when it was accrued, whether it was a result of prebankruptcy labor.","start":712.566,"stop":724.974,"duration":12.41},{"text":"Instead, Lines focused on the relationship of the asset to the debtor’s fresh start.","start":724.974,"stop":731.673,"duration":6.7},{"text":"The fact that it was not an investment or other kind of voluntary creation that it was a postbankruptcy event and that it was inconsistent entirely of wages, which traditionally are the only means for bankrupt to achieve his fresh start.","start":731.673,"stop":750.19,"duration":18.52},{"text":"Thus in Lines, this Court held that the wages represented by vacation pay were essential to a debtor’s fresh start.","start":750.19,"stop":759.196,"duration":9.01},{"text":"Seven months later, in Perez versus Campbell, the Court also held that a debtor shouldn’t be deprived of his driver’s license because of the burden that that would place on his earnings.","start":759.196,"stop":772.329,"duration":13.13},{"text":"The position of the bankrupt in this case is that the tax refund check, being wages, the loss of a tax refund check would be as serious of a burden on a debtor’s fresh start, as the loss of vacation pay, or the loss of a driver’s license.","start":772.329,"stop":792.016,"duration":19.69},{"text":"The second issue in this case is whether or not the Federal Wage Exemption Statute, the Consumer Credit Protection Act exempts 75% of the tax refund check.","start":792.016,"stop":803.46,"duration":11.44},{"text":"The Court need not reach this issue if it rules in the bankrupt’s favor on the first question.","start":803.46,"stop":810.775,"duration":7.31},{"text":"However, we contend that the CCPA should apply by the terms of the Bankruptcy Act, by terms of the CCPA for an independent policy reason and that -- by reference to administrative materials.","start":810.775,"stop":827.491,"duration":16.72},{"text":"First the Bankruptcy Act, many exemption statutes, state exemption statutes do not ever refer to bankruptcy.","start":827.491,"stop":835.625,"duration":8.13},{"text":"They are not written particularly with bankruptcy in mind, but they apply to a person who goes bankrupt because the Bankruptcy Act requires that they apply.","start":835.625,"stop":846.218,"duration":10.59},{"text":"It specifically stated in Section 6 that the bankrupt be allowed all states and federal exemptions.","start":846.218,"stop":853.971,"duration":7.75},{"text":"The CCPA, being a partial, federal wage exemption statute should apply to bankruptcy by the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act in Section 6.","start":853.971,"stop":866.813,"duration":12.84}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Connecticut, Connecticut, as I understand it doesn’t have any exemptions relevant to
