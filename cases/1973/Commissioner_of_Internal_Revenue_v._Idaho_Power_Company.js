essentially two different types of construction equipment.","start":179.903,"stop":187.615,"duration":7.71},{"text":"Uses automotive transportation equipment such as passenger cars, pickup trucks, heavier trucks and trailers and also what is called power operated equipment, which means primarily cranes, tractors, bulldozers, road graters and so

construction work, the respondent encourage a wide variety of construction cost.","start":233.639,"stop":240.098,"duration":6.46},{"text":"It pays wages to construction workers, it buys tools and materials which are used up in the course of construction, and it also incurs wear and tear or exhaustion of the construction equipment itself that is the construction related depreciation.","start":240.098,"stop":257.136,"duration":17.04},{"text":"On its general looks of account, the respondent capitalizes all of this construction cost.","start":257.136,"stop":262.079,"duration":4.94},{"text":"It does this in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles which recognize that this construction cost including construction related depreciation constitute capital outlays and not operating expenses.","start":262.079,"stop":276.76,"duration":14.68},{"text":"This fact is also recognized by the federal power

purposes.","start":276.76,"stop":291.883,"duration":15.12},{"text":"However, on its tax returns, the respondent treats these matters somewhat differently.","start":291.883,"stop":297.524,"duration":5.64},{"text":"It capitalizes most of its construction cost.","start":297.524,"stop":300.849,"duration":3.32},{"text":"For example, it capitalizes the wages paid to the operators of the construction equipment, does not deduct those wages as an ordinary unnecessary cost of doing business.","start":300.849,"stop":313.364,"duration":12.51},{"text":"It also capitalizes the cost of fuel used by the construction equipment and it capitalizes the cost of repairs to that equipment

income.","start":325.215,"stop":331.691,"duration":6.48},{"text":"The commissioner disallowed this depreciation deduction for the years in question and the tax court sustained that disallowance on the ground that Section 263 of the code requires the capitalization of all capital cost including construction related depreciation.","start":331.691,"stop":350.017,"duration":18.33},{"text":"However, the court of appeals of the Ninth Circuit reversed.","start":350.017,"stop":354.467,"duration":4.45},{"text":"I think it is fair to say that the opinion of the court of appeals came to a surprise, came as

engaged in the self construction of their capital facilities have complied with the services rulings and have capitalized their construction related depreciation.","start":384.433,"stop":398.051,"duration":13.62},{"text":"This long acceptance of the commissioner’s position makes the immediate revenue impact of this case quite substantial.","start":398.051,"stop":405.939,"duration":7.89},{"text":"Most railroads and utility companies and many large industrial corporations as well perform their own construction work, and as I have said, these taxpayers have in the past capitalized this depreciation either.","start":405.939,"stop":419.741,"duration":13.8},{"text":"But if the decision below were left standing, it was

income only in the future, not with the production of income in the present.","start":461.556,"stop":473.763,"duration":12.21},{"text":"The cause of that, the deduction of this depreciation, we tend to understate current net income and it would postpone or defer the recognition of income which the respondent has already earned.","start":473.763,"stop":486.872,"duration":13.11},{"text":"In other words, what the respondent is claiming in this case is the right to take an immediate deduction which is not sanctioned by normal accounting rules which would have the effect of postponing the recognition of income until future years.","start":486.872,"stop":501.47,"duration":14.6},{"text":"This Court has never permitted such deductions of amounts which were not sanctioned by normal

paid out” within the meaning of Section 263.","start":851.322,"stop":863.994,"duration":12.67},{"text":"On the first place, we believe that this argument overlooks the fact that this court held in

263.","start":863.994,"stop":880.628,"duration":16.63},{"text":"We need not reach so far in this case because we believe it’s clear that construction related depreciation is an amount paid out within

sense.","start":900.56,"stop":904.772,"duration":4.21},{"text":"That is the only construction in the statute which harmonizes the fundamental assumptions of the income tax system.","start":904.772,"stop":912.874,"duration":8.1},{"text":"Congress could have not required the capitalization only of actual payments, could not have intended that only actual payments be subject to capitalization.","start":912.874,"stop":924.022,"duration":11.15},{"text":"Historically, items such the issuance of stock, assumption of liabilities, the using up of construction materials,

capital asset is acquired.","start":924.022,"stop":948.448,"duration":24.43},{"text":"What is important under the statutory scheme is simply that when a capital asset is acquired, there will be some cost incurred, liability assumed rather responsibility undertaken which properly is a capital item.","start":948.448,"stop":963.069,"duration":14.62},{"text":"And in this case, the respondent by using out its construction equipment by physically exhausting that equipment has incurred a very real cost in the coarse of acquiring a capital asset, and that cost which is incurred gives rise to the capitalization requirement here.","start":963.069,"stop":984.45,"duration":21.38},{"text":"But even if the statute were read literally as requiring actual payment, it nevertheless does not require that payment to be made during the taxable year in question.","start":984.45,"stop":997.853,"duration":13.4},{"text":"Thus, when the respondent pays or incurs wage expenses in the course of constructing capital facilities and those wages aren’t paid out until the following year.","start":997.853,"stop":1010.155,"duration":12.3},{"text":"Nevertheless, there is a capital item in the first year, there is no actual payment, payment is made in the following year but it is the accrual of the wages in the first year which gives rise to a capital item but perhaps more to the point in this case.","start":1010.155,"stop":1026.074,"duration":15.92},{"text":"If the respondent purchases construction materials in one year and then uses up those construction materials in the two following years, when those construction materials are used up, that is a capital item which has to be capitalized as part of the basis of the capital facilities which are being constructed.","start":1026.074,"stop":1048.886,"duration":22.81},{"text":"And depreciation really is exactly the same as the consumption of these construction materials.","start":1048.886,"stop":1055.771,"duration":6.88},{"text":"The payment is made in the first year when construction equipment is acquired.","start":1055.771,"stop":1059.872,"duration":4.1},{"text":"But as the construction equipment is used up, depreciated, there gives rise to the capital item in exactly the same way as they using up of construction materials in subsequent years thus.","start":1059.872,"stop":1072.933,"duration":13.06},{"text":"In each case, you have a payment in an earlier year, but the using up of the asset which you have already paid for in the course of constructing your new capital facilities and all of this physical exhaustion or usage of materials as part of the cost of construction represents an amount paid out within the terms of the statute and as a capital item.","start":1072.933,"stop":1097.007,"duration":24.07},{"text":"We feel that this conclusion is supported by other provisions of the code.","start":1097.007,"stop":1101.304,"duration":4.3},{"text":"In our reply brief, we sited Sections 174, 182, 615, 616 and 617.","start":1101.304,"stop":1110.931,"duration":9.63},{"text":"All of these provisions permit a taxpayer to deduct items which would otherwise have to be capitalized.","start":1110.931,"stop":1119.046,"duration":8.12},{"text":"And each of these provisions does permit the deduction of construction related depreciation in very limited circumstances.","start":1119.046,"stop":1128.291,"duration":9.24},{"text":"We think it is clear that the congress by providing for the deduction of this kind of depreciation in those limited circumstances express this in -- in the first place it expresses awareness as such depreciation would otherwise be capital item not subject
