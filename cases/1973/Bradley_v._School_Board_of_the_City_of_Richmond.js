Coleman, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":43.101,"stop":47.566,"duration":4.47},{"text":"The issue here is a propriety under Section 718 of the 1972 School Aid Act or under the Fourteenth Amendment and the related jurisdiction of the Civil Rights Act statutes and the reversal by the Fourth Circuit of the District Court’s award of counsel fees for petitioners’ successful efforts in obtaining an injunction which required the Richmond School Board to adhere to its constitutional and statutory duty to desegregate its public schools.","start":47.566,"stop":83.813,"duration":36.25},{"text":"The issue tendered here predates and has nothing whatsoever to do with the subsequent Richmond area school case which this Court heard last term.","start":83.813,"stop":93.981,"duration":10.17},{"text":"Petitioners here are Black school children and their parents who live in Richmond and who were required to return to the District Court on March 10, 1970 to force respondents to adopt an effective desegregation plan.","start":93.981,"stop":109.669,"duration":15.69},{"text":"I say “required” because on May 30, 1966, after five years of litigation, the school board had proposed and the District Court had ordered a freedom of choice plan for the 1966 school year.","start":109.669,"stop":126.466,"duration":16.8},{"text":"Such plan, however, specifically provided and I call your attention to page 23 of the record that if such plan did not produce sufficient results -- significant results during the 1966-1967 school year, it would have to be modified.","start":126.466,"stop":144.932,"duration":18.47},{"text":"The plan also provided for desegregation of the school faculty.","start":144.932,"stop":149.464,"duration":4.53},{"text":"Moreover, on May 26, 1968, this Court decided Greene which held that freedom of choice plans which did not result in a unitary school system were unconstitutional.","start":149.464,"stop":163.067,"duration":13.6},{"text":"The schools in Richmond, both pupils and faculty, however, despite the 1966 plan and despite Greene, remained non-unitary, respondents did nothing whatsoever.","start":163.067,"stop":175.309,"duration":12.24},{"text":"So, finally, on March 10, 1970, petitioners were forced to move in the District Court for further relief.","start":175.309,"stop":182.455,"duration":7.15},{"text":"The motion included a request for counsel fees.","start":182.455,"stop":185.655,"duration":3.2},{"text":"The motion, after extensive litigation resulted in the school desegregation order of April 5, 1971, incidentally is the order under which the schools in Richmond are now being operated.","start":185.655,"stop":199.828,"duration":14.17},{"text":"The school -- the District Court then, as part of the equitable relief, awarded counsel fees for petitioners of $43,000 and costs of $13,000.","start":199.828,"stop":213.771,"duration":13.94},{"text":"Before making this award, the District Court determined that, on the record before it, the award was justified by respondent's conduct both in making necessary petitioners’ 1970 reopening of the case and in the course of the litigation thereafter.","start":213.771,"stop":233.383,"duration":19.61},{"text":"Ultimately, the court held that the fee award was justified by the fact that petitioners had acted as private attorneys general in securing respondent's compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment and such award was required to give complete and effective equitable relief.","start":233.383,"stop":251.824,"duration":18.44},{"text":"For a moment, I would like to call the Court’s attention to the findings of fact from which the District Court order was based.","start":251.824,"stop":259.089,"duration":7.26},{"text":"At page 133a of the record, the court found that since 1968, at the latest, the School Board was clearly in default of its constitutional duties to take steps which would result in a unitary school system that, when brought into court, even though the School Board admitted noncompliance, it put petitioners to the effort of showing that governmental action was behind the segregated school attendants prevailing in Richmond, that’s at page 115a of the record and page 133a of the record.","start":259.089,"stop":295.679,"duration":36.59},{"text":"The Trial Judge further found that respondents would take no steps whatsoever to end segregation in Richmond unless and until sued by petitioners and then, only as ordered by the District Court, and that’s the finding on page 133a of the record and 134a of the record.","start":295.679,"stop":316.916,"duration":21.24},{"text":"The counsel fee award was based in part upon these findings.","start":316.916,"stop":321.062,"duration":4.15},{"text":"Thus, we do not understand the observation of the Fourth Circuit, on page 167a of the record, that the District Court does not seem to have based its award on the inaction of the School Board prior to March 10, 1970.","start":321.062,"stop":336.143,"duration":15.08},{"text":"The District Court also found that the first two plans of desegregation which were filed by respondents as a result of the court order were clearly deficient.","start":336.143,"stop":345.485,"duration":9.34},{"text":"That finding is on page 117a -- 116a of the record and that two out of the three subsequent plans filed by the respondents were clearly deficient.","start":345.485,"stop":355.555,"duration":10.07},{"text":"Thus, time and effort was spent by petitioners in demonstrating the invalidity of the proposed plans until, finally, the court accepted plan 3.","start":355.555,"stop":365.863,"duration":10.31},{"text":"Finally, and this finding I think is quite important, the District Court found that the character of school desegregation cases by 1970 and 1971 had become such that full and appropriate equitable relief should include the award of expenses of litigation, that finding, sir, is made on page 137a of the record.","start":365.863,"stop":389.363,"duration":23.5},{"text":"And that counsel of great expertise was needed to aid the court, and that finding is on page 141a of the record.","start":389.363,"stop":397.547,"duration":8.18},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, nevertheless, reversed the award of counsel fees.","start":397.547,"stop":402.083,"duration":4.54},{"text":"Petitioners submit that there are five separate and distinct legal grounds, each of which required that the judgment of the District Court be reinstated.","start":402.083,"stop":416.295,"duration":14.21},{"text":"First, this Court’s decision in the Mills case and in the Hall case, cited on pages 21 and 23 of our record -- of our brief, permit legal fees to be awarded because petitioners’ actions benefited and ascertainable class, namely, the school -- all of the school children in Richmond.","start":416.295,"stop":440.018,"duration":23.72},{"text":"Second, petitioners are entitled to counsel fees because they acted as private attorney general in bringing this action which vindicated important constitutional and constitutional -- and congressional policy.","start":440.018,"stop":455.289,"duration":15.27},{"text":"Third, Section 718 of the School Aid Act of 1972 which we cite on page -- which we set forth in page 8 of our brief, enacted while this case was pending on appeal, expressly requires the award of counsel fees in school desegregation litigation.","start":455.289,"stop":474.314,"duration":19.03},{"text":"Fourth, it was within the discretion of the District Court, sitting as a Court of Equity to award counsel fees as necessary to ford full complete equitable relief in this particular school desegregation case.","start":474.314,"stop":491.011,"duration":16.7},{"text":"And, finally, the legal fees here were required by the District Court’s findings supported by the record that the respondents unreasonably -- acted unreasonably in refusing to desegregate voluntarily, the Richmond schools system and he persistently proposing a series of unworkable desegregation plans.","start":491.011,"stop":512.508,"duration":21.5},{"text":"It should be noted that only the fifth ground requires consideration of whether, as the District Court found, respondents’ conduct was unreasonably obstinate.","start":512.508,"stop":524.581,"duration":12.07}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A.
