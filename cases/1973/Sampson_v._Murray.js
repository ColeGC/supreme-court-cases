action against the federal probationary employee.","start":30.824,"stop":40.277,"duration":9.45},{"text":"Federal district court may enjoin the termination pending that employee's appeal to the Civil Service Commission.","start":40.277,"stop":47.497,"duration":7.22},{"text":"The facts are as follows.","start":47.497,"stop":50.585,"duration":3.09},{"text":"In January 1971, respondent was hired as a program analyst in the general services administration and a salary of about $18,000 a year.","start":50.585,"stop":61.897,"duration":11.31},{"text":"Four months later, one of her immediate supervisors sent to his supervisor, Mr. Sanders, a memorandum recommending that her employment be terminated.","start":61.897,"stop":74.816,"duration":12.92},{"text":"His recommendation set forth a variety of reasons why her work performance was considered to be unsatisfactory and that among these were her failure to follow the instructions of her supervisor, follow office direction generally and her inability to get along with her fellow employees.","start":74.816,"stop":94.771,"duration":19.95},{"text":"The memorandum went on however to state that she had experienced difficulties with her previous employer, the Defense Intelligence Agency.","start":94.771,"stop":104.465,"duration":9.69},{"text":"After studying this recommendation Mr. Sanders issued to the respondent a notice terminating her employment effective to next week, the termination notice stated expressly that the reasons for her termination or for failure to abide by office of procedure and to accept the direction of her supervisors.","start":104.465,"stop":127.338,"duration":22.87},{"text":"On receiving this termination notice the respondent filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission and lodged a complaint in the United States District Court to the District of Columbia.","start":127.338,"stop":138.844,"duration":11.51},{"text":"In her complaint in the court, she alleged or she asked for injunctive relief pending the appeal to the Civil Service Commission and she alleged that if an injunction would not issue permitting her to stay at employment, she would lose income for the interim period and unrebutted charges against her would remain in her personal record.","start":138.844,"stop":160.285,"duration":21.44},{"text":"The District Court immediately granted the temporary restraining order against her termination and set a hearing for the following week on the merits.","start":160.285,"stop":168.309,"duration":8.02},{"text":"For describing the events of that hearing it is helpful to first summarize briefly the Civil Service regulations pertaining to federal probationary employees so that the grounds for appeal in Civil Service Commission can be better understood.","start":168.309,"stop":183.668,"duration":15.36},{"text":"Under the Lloyd-LaFollette Act permanent employees in the competitive service, that is, employees who have finished their one year probationary term maybe discharged only for cause.","start":183.668,"stop":195.669,"duration":12},{"text":"But the Act does not provider similar protections for probationary employees, during her first year of service under the Act such employees maybe terminated at will, under the regulations however, Civil Service Commission certain rights are granted to probationary employees.","start":195.669,"stop":214.51,"duration":18.84},{"text":"Among these are the rights not to be terminated because of invidious class based discrimination, marital status, political activities or improper discrimination because of physical disability.","start":214.51,"stop":228.046,"duration":13.54},{"text":"In addition although a probationary employee maybe terminated upon the discovery of pre-employment misconduct, termination on that ground does invoke under the Civil Service regulations, certain procedural protections, the employee must be informed of the charges of pre-employment misconduct against him and he must be given an opportunity to respond to those charges in writing before the termination becomes effective.","start":228.046,"stop":256.519,"duration":28.47},{"text":"Thus when the respondent appealed to the Civil Service Commission, her claim was that not withstanding the fact that the termination notice recited only her poor work performance, she alleged that the fact that she was being terminated for pre-employment misconduct that is, events that took place at the Defense Intelligence Agency in her previous job.","start":256.519,"stop":280.166,"duration":23.65},{"text":"If she prevailed upon that appeal to the Civil Service Commission, she would be reinstated with back pay.","start":280.166,"stop":288.889,"duration":8.72},{"text":"However, at that time upon her reinstatement her employer would remain free under the Civil Service regulations to go forward with termination proceedings.","start":288.889,"stop":299.721,"duration":10.83},{"text":"All that GSA would have to do at that time would be to inform her in writing as to the charges pre-employment misconduct, if any, made against her and permit her an opportunity to respond to those charges before she was dismissed.","start":299.721,"stop":315.059,"duration":15.34},{"text":"In other words the respondent had no right to retain her employment under the constitution or under any statute or even under the regulations.","start":315.059,"stop":324.613,"duration":9.55},{"text":"All she had was a right to certain procedural regularities.","start":324.613,"stop":331.822,"duration":7.21},{"text":"I return now to the hearing which was held before the District Court on her motion for injunctive relief.","start":331.822,"stop":339.386,"duration":7.56},{"text":"At that time government filed a motion to dismiss one of equity jurisdiction; this motion was not active upon by the District Court.","start":339.386,"stop":350.139,"duration":10.75},{"text":"Instead the court proceeded to consider the merits of respondent’s requests for relief.","start":350.139,"stop":356.374,"duration":6.24},{"text":"District Court did not determine whether respondent had either alleged or shown that she was in danger of irreparable injury of the injunction would not issue.","start":356.374,"stop":367.136,"duration":10.76},{"text":"Instead the District Court first took up the question whether respondent would be likely to show before the Civil Service Commission that she in fact was being fired for pre-employment misconduct.","start":367.136,"stop":379.846,"duration":12.71},{"text":"That was an issue which would be tried by the commission on the basis of written submissions only.","start":379.846,"stop":386.564,"duration":6.72},{"text":"However, the District Court was not content to review the case on the basis of written submissions or so.","start":386.564,"stop":394.095,"duration":7.53},{"text":"Instead he requested that Mr. Sanders the GSA official who had ordered respondents termination, come to the court and testify as to his reasons for terminating or informing respondent that her employment was to be terminated.","start":394.095,"stop":411.352,"duration":17.26},{"text":"Mr. Sanders at that time was on vacation in California and he was not available to testify.","start":411.352,"stop":417.085,"duration":5.73},{"text":"Therefore the District Court continued to temporary restraining order until he should appear.","start":417.085,"stop":423.228,"duration":6.14},{"text":"The government appealed from that order to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit and that court affirmed cases now here on the government’s petition for certiorari which the respondent did not oppose.","start":423.228,"stop":435.934,"duration":12.71},{"text":"In the meantime the respondents appeal to the Civil Service Commission has been held pending the outcome of this suit.","start":435.934,"stop":444.229,"duration":8.29},{"text":"I turn now to the legal issues involved here; our principal contention is that the general statutory and administrative scheme governing federal employment precludes the exercise of equitable jurisdiction in cases such as this.","start":444.229,"stop":460.758,"duration":16.53},{"text":"This scheme which I will describe in a moment must be understood in its decisional context.","start":460.758,"stop":466.959,"duration":6.2},{"text":"Under the decisions of this court a federal employee in the absence of any protective legislation or regulations has no right at all to employment, his employment maybe terminated at will, following this general rule the court expressly held in White against Berry which we cited on brief, that the federal courts have no general equity jurisdiction to enjoin a discharge of a probationary or of a federal employee rather.","start":466.959,"stop":498.717,"duration":31.76},{"text":"That case involved a discharge which allegedly was in conflict with the pertinent Civil Service regulations at that time.","start":498.717,"stop":508.539,"duration":9.82},{"text":"In short White against Berry involves essentially the identical issue here and this court could not affirm that overruling of that case.","start":508.539,"stop":518.898,"duration":10.36},{"text":"In any event, that decisional background, Congress in 1912 decided to extend certain additional protections to certain federal employees.","start":518.898,"stop":530.592,"duration":11.69},{"text":"It enacted the Lloyd-LaFollette Act which as I have previously stated, affords to non-probationary employees in the competitive service.","start":530.592,"stop":540.44,"duration":9.85},{"text":"The protection that they maybe discharged only for cause subsequent enactment and promulgated regulations established for such employees.","start":540.44,"stop":551.212,"duration":10.77},{"text":"The elaborate appeal procedures which are now before this Court in Arnett against Kennedy which was argued last week.","start":551.212,"stop":558.165,"duration":6.95},{"text":"However, in enacting Lloyd-LaFollette Act Congress determined there should be a one year probationary term during which the employee would not be afforded such procedures, could be terminated without a for cause determination.","start":558.165,"stop":572.909,"duration":14.74}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Jones if the government loses this case; could the regulation in question be
