argument that the case was the -- the jurisdiction of the state court was preempted, was rejected in Benz fundamentally because the court said that they found no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended the National Labor Relations Act to apply to disputes between nationals of foreign countries, operating ships under foreign laws and noted that the whole background of the National Labor Relations Act is concerned with industrial disputes between American employers and employees.","start":804.376,"stop":852.808,"duration":48.43},{"text":"For us to run interference in

decision.","start":864.155,"stop":874.708,"duration":10.55},{"text":"It's interesting and we pointed this out in our main brief that in the Benz case, the unions expressed the same long term goals as

Benz.","start":874.708,"stop":906.246,"duration":31.54},{"text":"The court -- I think the Benz case shows that the fact that the goals of an American union which are -- the fact that they are domestic goals does not mean that a dispute which centers on the wages of a foreign crews of a vessel are governed by the Labor Act.","start":906.246,"stop":933.906,"duration":27.66},{"text":"In other words, the goals of the union are not to be confused with the subject matter of the dispute.","start":933.906,"stop":948.757,"duration":14.85},{"text":"The next case was the McCulloch case in 1963.","start":948.757,"stop":955.596,"duration":6.84},{"text":"That case involved whether or not the NLRB was empowered by the Labor Act to conduct an election on board of foreign ship.","start":955.596,"stop":970.739,"duration":15.14},{"text":"The specific question that the court said was to be decided was stated to be whether the act as written was intended to have any application to foreign registered vessels employing alien seamen.","start":970.739,"stop":982.648,"duration":11.91},{"text":"And the court concluded in accordance with the Benz decision and I think it just followed the Benz decision -- it followed from the Benz decision that the jurisdictional provisions of the act do not extend to the maritime operations of foreign flagships employing alien seamen.","start":982.648,"stop":1001.687,"duration":19.04},{"text":"The third case was the Incres case.","start":1001.687,"stop":1005.967,"duration":4.28},{"text":"Incres, as Benz again involve

organized primary -- had been formed primarily to organized foreign seamen.","start":1023.743,"stop":1035.121,"duration":11.38},{"text":"And the picketing in that case was part of their campaign to
