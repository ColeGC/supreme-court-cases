Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"One of the issues is identical, Mr. Justice Douglas.","start":97.565,"stop":100.26,"duration":2.7},{"text":"That’s correct.","start":100.26,"stop":102.335,"duration":2.07},{"text":"But as I was saying, the application of Title V in any given case also depends upon the nature of the governmental activities in question.","start":102.335,"stop":110.296,"duration":7.96},{"text":"For that reason, I will discuss at the outset how the particular activities of the Federal Power Commission for which the fees here have been assessed.","start":110.296,"stop":120.695,"duration":10.4},{"text":"The Power Commission has authority to regulate two industries, electric energy and natural gas industries.","start":120.695,"stop":127.293,"duration":6.6},{"text":"In connection with its regulation of the natural gas industry, at issue here are certain annual fees which the Commission has imposed in connection with its regulation of the sale of natural gas.","start":127.293,"stop":140.83,"duration":13.54},{"text":"There are two types of sales in question.","start":140.83,"stop":143.039,"duration":2.21},{"text":"One, from producers to pipeline companies, and the second is resale by pipeline companies in interstate commerce.","start":143.039,"stop":151.396,"duration":8.36},{"text":"In regulating producer sales, the Commission reviews the contracts between the producer and the pipeline company for delivery of natural gas at the wellhead.","start":151.396,"stop":162.215,"duration":10.82},{"text":"The delivery of natural gas at the wellhead cannot commence until the Commission approves the contract as to amount, price, and other terms and conditions of sale.","start":162.215,"stop":173.082,"duration":10.87},{"text":"The approval of the contract takes the form of what is called the issuance of a producer certificate.","start":173.082,"stop":179.207,"duration":6.13},{"text":"This certificate permits the pipeline company to take delivery of the natural gas at the wellhead and to begin transporting it in interstate commerce.","start":179.207,"stop":188.344,"duration":9.14},{"text":"Instead of imposing a fee for the issuance of each particular certificate, the Commission has determined to impose an annual fee on each pipeline company based upon the amounts of natural gas reserves certified for delivery to that company in connection with the Producer Certificate Program during the year.","start":188.344,"stop":209.133,"duration":20.79},{"text":"And this so-called added reserve fee is the first of the fees at issue in this case.","start":209.133,"stop":216.192,"duration":7.06},{"text":"The Commission is also responsible for regulating the sales of the pipeline companies, as I have indicated.","start":216.192,"stop":223.418,"duration":7.23},{"text":"The review of the sales by the pipeline companies takes the form of review and approval of pipeline rate schedules.","start":223.418,"stop":233.425,"duration":10.01},{"text":"And this review procedure is invoked normally by the filing by a pipeline company of a new rate schedule.","start":233.425,"stop":241.419,"duration":7.99},{"text":"Ordinarily or at least frequently, the Commission permits a new rate schedule to go into effect without holding rate setting hearings.","start":241.419,"stop":250.24,"duration":8.82},{"text":"But when hearings are held, as is frequently the case, they can be time consuming, expensive, and quite complicated.","start":250.24,"stop":258.68,"duration":8.44},{"text":"As a consequence, the rate setting proceeding, pertaining to any particular filing of a new rate schedule, may bear a little direct relationship to the dollar amount of the rate increase which is being sought.","start":258.68,"stop":273.212,"duration":14.53},{"text":"For that reason, the Commission has determined that it’s more equitable to impose a fee not on the basis of each particular rate increase filing, but rather in the form of an annual fee imposed upon all pipeline companies on the basis of annual sales.","start":273.212,"stop":288.889,"duration":15.68},{"text":"That is the second fee at issue in this case.","start":288.889,"stop":291.515,"duration":2.63},{"text":"And those are the two pipeline company fees in question here.","start":291.515,"stop":295.948,"duration":4.43},{"text":"The Commission also regulates the electric energy companies.","start":295.948,"stop":300.566,"duration":4.62},{"text":"And its regulation of those companies is similar in basic outline to the regulation of the natural gas industry.","start":300.566,"stop":308.023,"duration":7.46},{"text":"The Commission has responsibility for regulating the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, and the sale of that energy for resale.","start":308.023,"stop":318.516,"duration":10.49},{"text":"In carrying out this responsibility, it conducts what is called a coordination and reliability program.","start":318.516,"stop":324.614,"duration":6.1},{"text":"This program consists of a region-by-region monitoring of the adequacy of electric transmission and generating facilities in connect -- in relation to the growing demand for electric energy and the shifting pattern of its use from season to season and from day time and night time.","start":324.614,"stop":343.994,"duration":19.38},{"text":"In connection with this program, the Commission is authorized to direct electric utility companies to interconnect their transmission facilities, one with the other.","start":343.994,"stop":356.239,"duration":12.24},{"text":"These interconnections minimize the likelihood of blackouts and brownouts and permit the electric utility companies to share their generating facilities in effect, rather than relying entirely upon their own generating facilities.","start":356.239,"stop":372.236,"duration":16},{"text":"Since this Coordination and Reliability Program is conducted on an industry-wide basis and not at the instance of any particular company, the Commission is determined that the only fair and practical means of allocating the cost of the program is through an industry-wide assessment.","start":372.236,"stop":387.69,"duration":15.45},{"text":"And that assessment is the third of the fees at issue here.","start":387.69,"stop":391.703,"duration":4.01},{"text":"The Commission also regulates the rates charged by electric utility companies in their sale of electric energy for resale.","start":391.703,"stop":400.491,"duration":8.79},{"text":"The electric utility companies file new rate schedules and the Commission has imposed a sliding scale fee for the filing of a right schedule, and it’s anticipated that the sliding scale fee will cover the major portion of the cost of the Commission’s electric utility rate setting activities.","start":400.491,"stop":419.707,"duration":19.22},{"text":"But since those activities or the cost of those activities cannot be known until the end of the year for any given year and also because the Commission undertakes certain incidental regulatory activities for which there’s no set fee, it is anticipated that the sliding scale fees will not cover the full pertinent regulatory cost here.","start":419.707,"stop":439.7,"duration":19.99},{"text":"For that reason, the Commission has also imposed an annual fee on the electric utility companies to cover the residual cost of rate setting and other incidental costs.","start":439.7,"stop":449.787,"duration":10.09},{"text":"To recapitulate, there are four fees here at issue.","start":449.787,"stop":453.689,"duration":3.9},{"text":"The added reserve fee on the pipeline companies in connection with the Producer Certificate Program, the fee on the pipeline companies to cover the cost of rate setting activities, the fee on the electric utility companies to cover the cost of the Coordination and Reliability Program, and finally the fee on the electric utility companies to cover certain residual and incidental costs.","start":453.689,"stop":477.857,"duration":24.17},{"text":"The Court of Appeals held all four fees to be invalid.","start":477.857,"stop":481.712,"duration":3.85},{"text":"The court determined that a fee is justified under Title V only if it is in return for the conferral of a special benefit.","start":481.712,"stop":491.039,"duration":9.33},{"text":"And the court concluded that there was not special benefit conferred on the two industries here in question.","start":491.039,"stop":497.345,"duration":6.31},{"text":"The court went on to add that, in its view, the imposition of fees of this kind was somehow inconsistent with the Commission’s responsibility for regulating in a public interest.","start":497.345,"stop":509.051,"duration":11.71},{"text":"I will now turn to the legal issues which are raised by the Court of Appeals’ opinion.","start":509.051,"stop":513.077,"duration":4.03}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Jones, before you do, and I’m asking this primarily simply out of curiosity.","start":513.077,"stop":518.816,"duration":5.74},{"text":"We heard in the last case about the fees charged by the communications commission, and this went about the fees charged by the power commission.","start":518.816,"stop":528.037,"duration":9.22},{"text":"Are these exceptional or is it the rule rather than the exception?","start":528.037,"stop":533.597,"duration":5.56},{"text":"In other words, does the Securities and Exchange Commission, does the Interstate Commerce Commission, does the various other
