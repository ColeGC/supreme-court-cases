the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.","start":39.892,"stop":48.386,"duration":8.49},{"text":"The issue has been limited to the question of whether the Court of Appeals erred in failing to certify the question of Florida law to the Supreme Court of Florida pursuant to its certification statute.","start":48.386,"stop":63.428,"duration":15.04},{"text":"I will speak for the petitioners in the three cases which have been consolidated for argument and I would ask to reserve three minutes for rebuttal, Your Honor.","start":63.428,"stop":75.342,"duration":11.91},{"text":"It is the position of petitioners here Your Honors that it was error for the Second Circuit to refuse to certify the issue of Florida Law to the Supreme Court of Florida.","start":75.342,"stop":86.401,"duration":11.06},{"text":"The decision below exemplifies a new doctrine on the Florida law or in fact the law of any state.","start":86.401,"stop":95.199,"duration":8.8},{"text":"Although purporting to find support under the case of Diamond against Oreamuno in the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, the decision below here is in fact a radical extension of the Diamond case.","start":95.199,"stop":113.088,"duration":17.89},{"text":"The question of Florida law here is significant under the public policy of Florida.","start":113.088,"stop":118.443,"duration":5.36},{"text":"It involves a Florida corporation and it involves the regulation of that Corporation’s relationship to its fiduciaries and its shareholders and to those who buy and sell its stock.","start":118.443,"stop":133.805,"duration":15.36},{"text":"The decision below adopted a remedy here which could interfere with recovery by shareholders of that Corporation when they sue on an insider trading case.","start":133.805,"stop":148.664,"duration":14.86},{"text":"Therefore, we can believe that in light of the significant question of Florida law and public policy that was involved, the Court of Appeals should have certified the question as it was requested to do by Judge Kaufman in his dissenting opinion.","start":148.664,"stop":164.779,"duration":16.12},{"text":"Now, Your Honors, I would briefly discuss the underlined facts in this case and the opinions below.","start":164.779,"stop":171.126,"duration":6.35},{"text":"This case arose out of an alleged misuse of inside information and subsequent insider trading.","start":171.126,"stop":179.835,"duration":8.71},{"text":"Lum’s Incorporated is a Florida Corporation which was engaged in the fast food franchising business.","start":179.835,"stop":188.339,"duration":8.5},{"text":"During 1969, in the attempt of diversification, it acquired a gambling casino in Las Vegas known as Caesar’s Palace.","start":188.339,"stop":197.68,"duration":9.34},{"text":"And to acquaint the financial community with its new acquisition, it held what it described as a seminar in Caesar’s Palace in November of 1969.","start":197.68,"stop":208.837,"duration":11.16},{"text":"Apparently, during that seminar, it released an earning’s forecast of a dollar to a dollar ten cents per share.","start":208.837,"stop":218.296,"duration":9.46},{"text":"Subsequently, in January of 1970, it was alleged and when I make these claims of allegations, I am basically stating the allegations of the Securities and Exchange Commission which filed a complaint for injunctive relief in December 1970, all of the subsequent civil cases are basically copies, if you will, of the SEC complaint.","start":218.296,"stop":242.317,"duration":24.02},{"text":"It was alleged that one Melvin Chasen, who was the Chief Operating Officer of Lum’s, learned of a decline, substantial decline in the earnings for Lum’s second quarter that he advised a Mr. Benjamin Simon, who was a registered representative employed by Lehman Brothers in its Chicago office of this decline.","start":242.317,"stop":265.373,"duration":23.06},{"text":"And that Mr. Simon in turn passed on this information to representatives of Investors Diversified Services in Minneapolis.","start":265.373,"stop":274.72,"duration":9.35},{"text":"All of these events were alleged to have occurred on January 8 and on January 9, two of the IDS funds sold 83,000 shares of Lum’s stock.","start":274.72,"stop":288.85,"duration":14.13},{"text":"Trading was suspended on the 9th.","start":288.85,"stop":291.532,"duration":2.68},{"text":"Lum’s issued a press release later in the afternoon announcing the decline in its earnings.","start":291.532,"stop":296.708,"duration":5.18},{"text":"When trading resumed the following Monday, the stock was off $3.00 to $4.00 per share.","start":296.708,"stop":302.693,"duration":5.98},{"text":"The sales on the previous Friday, had occurred at $17.00.","start":302.693,"stop":306.963,"duration":4.27},{"text":"Now the SEC investigated and in the following December, as I said, they filed an injunction action and that was followed by a rash of civil suits and those suits basically fell into two categories.","start":306.963,"stop":321.558,"duration":14.59},{"text":"One category consisted of derivative actions seeking recovery by Lum's of the trading profits.","start":321.558,"stop":331.578,"duration":10.02},{"text":"The second category was a class action.","start":331.578,"stop":335.485,"duration":3.91},{"text":"Several suits constitute, class actions on behalf of sellers or purchasers of the stock on the day of the trade-off.","start":335.485,"stop":347.058,"duration":11.57},{"text":"So at the commencement of the litigation there were three prompts to the regulatory structure: the SEC injunction action, the derivative suits, and the class actions.","start":347.058,"stop":360.59,"duration":13.53},{"text":"Now, the defendants below moved to dismiss before Judge Tyler, the derivative actions.","start":360.59,"stop":368.846,"duration":8.26},{"text":"The derivative actions were premised on the rule of Diamond against Oreamuno, which is a New York case and that case briefly stated that officers and directors of a corporation who trade on inside information are required to remit their profits to the corporation even though the corporation has not been damaged in any legal sense.","start":368.846,"stop":397.041,"duration":28.19},{"text":"The court espoused this doctrine in the context of a situation which was really a gross instance of misuse of corporate information The two top officers of the company, MAI had learned of an earnings declined and had sold their own stock at triggering an enormous decline in the price of the shares.","start":397.041,"stop":423.436,"duration":26.39},{"text":"As the case reached the Court of Appeals in New York, there were no other actions pending.","start":423.436,"stop":428.996,"duration":5.56},{"text":"The SEC had not commenced the preceding, Section 16 (b) did not apply because the stock had been held more than six months and there were no class actions or any actions pending by any of the defrauded purchasers of that stock.","start":428.996,"stop":446.468,"duration":17.47},{"text":"And so, the argument before the Court of Appeals and strongly urged in the brief by the respondent was that if no remedy is fashioned here, these parties escaped with the illegal profits.","start":446.468,"stop":465.158,"duration":18.69},{"text":"That was the context of the Diamond case.","start":465.158,"stop":467.772,"duration":2.61},{"text":"It is the law in New York to the best of our research, it has never been cited or discussed in any decision in any other state court.","start":467.772,"stop":479.493,"duration":11.72},{"text":"It’s five years old now.","start":479.493,"stop":480.741,"duration":1.25},{"text":"It came down in 1969.","start":480.741,"stop":484.036,"duration":3.3},{"text":"So the derivative suits here were premised on the Diamond case, but it was the defendants’ position that it was the Law of Florida that applied to the responsibility of insiders to the corporation.","start":484.036,"stop":498.157,"duration":14.12}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"The defendants here
