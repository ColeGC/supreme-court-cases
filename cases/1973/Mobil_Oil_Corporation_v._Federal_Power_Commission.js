settlement which was appended to the motion.","start":389.748,"stop":399.906,"duration":10.16},{"text":"The Commission then issued notice of that and provided for the filing of comments.","start":399.906,"stop":405.573,"duration":5.67},{"text":"The comments indicated very wide support for the settlement from major producers in the area, pipeline purchasers, distribution companies in two groups and some state Commissions.","start":405.573,"stop":421.056,"duration":15.48},{"text":"However, the settlement was opposed by Mobil by another major producer in the area, in

Commission adopted a formula set out on the settlement proposal to dispose refund liabilities.","start":497.658,"stop":512.039,"duration":14.38},{"text":"Specific rates were fixed for the past period.","start":512.039,"stop":515.815,"duration":3.78},{"text":"Amounts collected by individual producers in excess of those rates were not to be refunded, but were to be retained as working capital

Commission adopted precisely a two-part rate structure that was set out in the settlement.","start":531.761,"stop":543.558,"duration":11.8},{"text":"Rates were prescribed for flowing gas that is rates for -- sales under contracts dated prior to October 1, 1968, a fixed escalation in October, 1973 was provided and a system was included for contingent escalations up to a total of 1.5 cents, up to 1977, if by that time the industry as a whole dedicates certain specified quantities of new gas in the area.","start":543.558,"stop":579.133,"duration":35.58},{"text":"But on one of the points we

others.","start":589.692,"stop":607.644,"duration":17.95},{"text":"The rate structure also includes a separate rate for new gas, that is sales on the contract dated after October 1, 1968 and a moratorium on increases in rates under Section 4 of the Act, extending to October 1, 1976 for flowing gas and October 1, 1977 for the new gas.","start":607.644,"stop":631.958,"duration":24.31},{"text":"Other provisions that we have raised and discussed in our briefs were included, precisely as set out in the settlement.","start":631.958,"stop":641.337,"duration":9.38},{"text":"The opponents of the settlement sought rehearing as required by Section 19 (a) of the Natural Gas Act.","start":641.337,"stop":649.349,"duration":8.01},{"text":"This was denied by Commission Opinion 598-A in which the Commission reiterated that it adopted this settlement proposal in its

affirmed.","start":661.351,"stop":664.815,"duration":3.46},{"text":"In August 1973, however, the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the Commission as to an identical rate structure which the Commission had imposed in the Texas Gulf Coast area, finding essential elements of this rate structure in conflict with the standards of Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act.","start":664.815,"stop":686.613,"duration":21.8},{"text":"The proceedings in this Court then followed.","start":686.613,"stop":689.515,"duration":2.9},{"text":"Now the issue is raised by Mobil go

the Permian Basin decision in 1968.","start":689.515,"stop":714.081,"duration":24.57},{"text":"The issues we raise also go to the invalidity of essential elements of this rate structure.","start":714.081,"stop":720.922,"duration":6.84},{"text":"In our view, the District of Columbia Circuit Opinion which is before this Court is correct.","start":720.922,"stop":728.096,"duration":7.17},{"text":"This structure violates express standards of Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act which prohibit unjust and unreasonable rates and also prohibit unduly discriminatory and unduly preferential rate structures.","start":728.096,"stop":746.907,"duration":18.81},{"text":"In addition, as our briefs indicate, there are substantial parts of the Commission’s opinion in this case which do not include any of the findings that this Court indicated in both Hope and in Permian are required for valid rates under the Natural Gas Act.","start":746.907,"stop":766.703,"duration":19.8},{"text":"Now in particulars as to our view on the discriminatory and preferential nature of this rate structure, it begins with this treatment of refunds for the past period and it carries on from that over into the rates prescribed for present and future.","start":766.703,"stop":791.501,"duration":24.8},{"text":"By the treatment of refunds, the Commission has in effect in this case, adopted a rate structure which prefers the producers who in the past collected the highest rates, who did not follow Commission guidelines and policies between 1960 and 1968, it provides those producers additional and special working capital available in the present and in the future for use in competitive bidding and other operations and this same formula is tied to the flowing gas rates that were fixed here for the present and the future.","start":791.501,"stop":831.373,"duration":39.87},{"text":"We cite in our briefs specific parts of the Commission’s opinion which reflect that the Commission treated its present and future allowance for exploration and development capital and the other capital allowances in the flowing gas rates as in part satisfied by this special allowance of working capital to the few producers who owed the large refunds.","start":831.373,"stop":858.069,"duration":26.7},{"text":"As we cited in our brief, they are quite disproportionate.","start":858.069,"stop":863.064,"duration":5},{"text":"They do not or not proportional among producers in the area and only a handful of the producers owe the bulk of the refunds, but under this rate structure, both as to past, present and future, the incentives and the benefits the Commission has allowed or channeled straight to those three producers and they are not allowed to the remaining producers in the area.","start":863.064,"stop":891.362,"duration":28.3},{"text":"Now --","start":891.362,"stop":892.221,"duration":0.86}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A.

Gilliam","textObjs":[{"text":"Your Honor, of course Mr. Morrow will address this question from the viewpoint of the consumers, but in the District of Columbia Circuit opinion, the opinion notes that this is adverse both to the interests of producers in the area who are old producers such as Mobil and adverse to new entrants and adverse to the competitive structure in the area, and therefore, would be adverse to the ultimate benefits that consumers should expect in the sense of the two objectives of the statute which are reasonable rates and an adequate supply.","start":906.336,"stop":952.991,"duration":46.65},{"text":"Now the analysis of that in the Texas Gulf opinion, from the District of Columbia Circuit is quite detailed.","start":952.991,"stop":960.492,"duration":7.5},{"text":"We rely on that quite heavily and I think it does cover this problem which we raise of undue discrimination and preference both from the viewpoint of the affected producer and from the view point of the ultimate consumer and in that opinion, the basis for the opinion by the District of Columbia Circuit, rested of course on the statutory standard, but on the adverse impact on both of the most affected interests.","start":960.492,"stop":993.351,"duration":32.86},{"text":"Now in the analysis of this rate structure, everything for present and future that we attack is being too low or not a high enough reasonable rate, not high enough current allowance at 1969 and 1971 cost.","start":993.351,"stop":1010.703,"duration":17.35},{"text":"Everything was justified all along the way by ah yes, but we made those allowances in the treatment of refunds.","start":1010.703,"stop":1020.147,"duration":9.44},{"text":"But then when you look at that, those allowances go in only a few directions.","start":1020.147,"stop":1025.99,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Those who follow the past policy are somewhat left out in the cold so to speak.","start":1025.99,"stop":1031.429,"duration":5.44},{"text":"It even comes in the opinion before the Fifth Circuit on the moratorium.","start":1031.429,"stop":1036.404,"duration":4.97},{"text":"In the Permian case, this Court spelled out certain things the Commission should find when it imposes a moratorium on rate increases such as projected stability of cost, trends as to rising cost, on this instance, it would have been looking towards the 70s.","start":1036.404,"stop":1055.965,"duration":19.56},{"text":"Here we have only five lines in the Commission opinion which establish a moratorium from August 1971 to 1976 and 1977 in one of the nation’s most critical areas.","start":1055.965,"stop":1071.545,"duration":15.58},{"text":"There is not one word in those five lines about whether cost could be expected to rise, whether capital requirements would be greater or so on and yet the Fifth Circuit opinion, in looking at our objection to that and comparing it with what this Court said in Permian, the Fifth Circuit says ah yes but somehow that is compensated for by the refund allowances that were permitted under this rate structure.","start":1071.545,"stop":1103.05,"duration":31.5},{"text":"But I would suggest that is no compensation to those producers who did not collect those rates in the past and it's an intermixture, an intertwined effort to tie together a rate structure to protect refund liabilities for a handful of companies, but in so doing, the Commission has mixed it up with what should be current and future just and reasonable rates for the entire area industry.","start":1103.05,"stop":1138.561,"duration":35.51},{"text":"It has used that also to lay down a moratorium on the whole area and has done it in a period when even this record which cut off in 1971 indicated that we already were in a natural gas shortage.","start":1138.561,"stop":1155.981,"duration":17.42},{"text":"It indicated that the heaviest demands for capital on this industry that have ever existed would arise in the 1970s and when the drilling effort, increasingly, must be directed toward greater offshore distances, deeper drilling and so on.","start":1155.981,"stop":1177.963,"duration":21.98},{"text":"Now with that, we have the Commission simply adopting a rate structure that in our view was tailor-made to benefit only a handful of people who had collected as we say the highest rates from 1960 to 1968.","start":1177.963,"stop":1197.948,"duration":19.99},{"text":"There are other issues that we have raised that deal with particular parts of the settlement agreement, one of them I have mentioned, the moratorium.","start":1197.948,"stop":1208.488,"duration":10.54},{"text":"We also have brought the question of the Commission’s refusal to make an adequate allowance for our royalty payments.","start":1208.488,"stop":1217.087,"duration":8.6},{"text":"In Southern Louisiana, the producer’s payments of royalty to others, including governmental institutions are some 16% of total

payment.","start":1217.087,"stop":1243.443,"duration":26.36},{"text":"That assumption by the Commission some years ago was held to be invalid and yet the Commission still is prescribing rates on the
