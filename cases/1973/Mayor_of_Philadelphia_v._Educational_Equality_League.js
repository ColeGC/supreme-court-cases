J. Tate, and the members of the Educational Nominating Panel.","start":20.156,"stop":38.796,"duration":18.64},{"text":"The allegations made contended that the appointment to that panel discriminated on the basis of race and, therefore, it was requested that the appointments made by the Mayor be strict in as invalidly made under the constitution.","start":38.796,"stop":55.802,"duration":17.01},{"text":"In order to fully understand what the case is all about, it is necessary to understand something about the Educational Home Rule Charter provisions of the City of Philadelphia and the method of selecting and appointing members of the School Board.","start":55.802,"stop":72.14,"duration":16.34},{"text":"In 1965, the electors of the City of Philadelphia adopted a new home rule charter establishing a Home Rule School District.","start":72.14,"stop":85.345,"duration":13.2},{"text":"This was a result of a Commission appointed by Mayor Tate which studied the problem and nature of the school district some-years before the City of Philadelphia having obtained an almost complete home rule in all other aspects.","start":85.345,"stop":103.033,"duration":17.69},{"text":"The legislature of the common law of Pennsylvania had authorized, now something new, a home rule for the School District of Philadelphia as well.","start":103.033,"stop":112.121,"duration":9.09},{"text":"A Commission was appointed and, because of various problems, came up with what essentially was experimental in nature, and also represented something of compromise.","start":112.121,"stop":123.842,"duration":11.72},{"text":"The method of selecting members of the School Board, which is not an issue in this matter before the Court, was determined essentially as follows.","start":123.842,"stop":135.518,"duration":11.68},{"text":"The Mayor of the City of Philadelphia would appoint 13 members of the Educational Nominating Panel.","start":135.518,"stop":144.555,"duration":9.04},{"text":"Those 13 members would in turn, for each vacancy on the Board, recommend initially three, and if the Mayor requested, an additional three persons from which the Mayor could make the appointments to the Board of Education.","start":144.555,"stop":161.709,"duration":17.15},{"text":"The 13 of the 39 were required to be appointed from certain classes of organizations within the City of Philadelphia.","start":161.709,"stop":173.537,"duration":11.83},{"text":"There were supposed to be citywide in scope and representative of such groups as the labor, commercial interest intergroup relations, parent-teacher associations, public education representatives, general community organizations of citizens, organizations for the purpose of improvement of local government, higher education in the form of someone who is Head of a higher education institution in the City of Philadelphia, and a group concerned with the physical resources of the city.","start":173.537,"stop":211.825,"duration":38.29}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

panel.","start":262.855,"stop":268.867,"duration":6.01}]},{"speakerName":"John Mattioni","textObjs":[{"text":"That’s correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun.","start":268.867,"stop":271.382,"duration":2.51},{"text":"The attack here is solely on the appointments made to the Educational Nominating Panel, not to any appointments made to the School Board of the School District of the City of Philadelphia and, furthermore, there’s no attack made on the Charter Scheme for appointments to the Board of Education nor any attack made on the validity of the nine categories and then, after those nine, there is four that are appointments in essence at large by the Mayor where he has total discretion in terms of those four.","start":271.382,"stop":310.863,"duration":39.48},{"text":"Now, they say, I believe that this is essentially an experimental type concept and at least until this attack seemed to work reasonably well.","start":310.863,"stop":323.598,"duration":12.74},{"text":"The harder guts of the whole procedure was that you wanted to have on this panel persons who represented, in essence, all of the various kinds of problems that a School Board and a School District would have to deal with during the course of its existence.","start":323.598,"stop":345.354,"duration":21.76},{"text":"As, for example, we all know in a-- in large urban School Districts now and indeed in many of the smaller ones, there are truculently substantial labor management relations problems and, of course, in Philadelphia where we do not escape this, in the last couple of years, we’ve been subject to rather extended and protracted labor disputes with school teachers and labor disputes with other support personnel in the School District.","start":345.354,"stop":372.99,"duration":27.64},{"text":"The School Board has to contend with economic problems of a rather major proportion and, again, the purpose of the charter was to make sure that we had represented on the Nominating Panel people who could screen applicants and not possible nominees for the School Board to insure that they met at least minimally all of the necessary requirements, and the concept was to have people on the Nominating Panel who had expertise in their particular areas.","start":372.99,"stop":406.868,"duration":33.88},{"text":"As, for example, an organization dealing with intergroup relations, because it’s quite clear that urban School Districts have substantial race relations problems and other problems of a similar nature and I think this is borne out by the fact that the Head of the Charter Commission wrote and as quoted in respondents’ brief, “the Panel’s composition should be so-arranged in the charter that it can always constitute a balanced representation or a cross-section of the entire community, all of the community’s ethnic, racial, economic, geographic elements and segments” and the point here and the reason why I’m dwelling on this is it’s important to understand that this charter, at this charter scheme was intended to be representative in a very much broader sense than simply on the basis of Black and White.Respondents would have that the only consideration is representation on the basis of Black and White.","start":406.868,"stop":473.615,"duration":66.75},{"text":"I believe this is further borne out by the fact that we’re here dealing with the fourth largest city in the United States, a city with a population of approximately 2 million people, a city which has in its populous persons from all kinds and all manner of racial and ethnic backgrounds.","start":473.615,"stop":495.456,"duration":21.84},{"text":"For example, there are large concentrations of Italian-Americans, Russian-Americans, German-Americans.","start":495.456,"stop":501.266,"duration":5.81},{"text":"There are large concentrations of Blacks and of course Blacks, like all other people, can’t be put into a bowl and mixed up.","start":501.266,"stop":508.988,"duration":7.72},{"text":"These are diverse people.","start":508.988,"stop":511.528,"duration":2.54},{"text":"They are, if nothing else, they can be divided into two broad general categories: Blacks who were in Philadelphia for hundreds of years, who predated even the Constitution of the United States, and those who are of very recent migration from areas in the South.","start":511.528,"stop":528.977,"duration":17.45},{"text":"But in addition to that, in addition to the variations in population, Philadelphia is a large industrial city.","start":528.977,"stop":537.105,"duration":8.13},{"text":"It has heavy industry, oil refineries, smelting industries.","start":537.105,"stop":541.139,"duration":4.03},{"text":"It’s a large commercial center.","start":541.139,"stop":543.519,"duration":2.38},{"text":"It has banks and brokerage houses and stock exchanges.","start":543.519,"stop":546.352,"duration":2.83},{"text":"It has large commercial areas and retail sales and the like.","start":546.352,"stop":551.759,"duration":5.41},{"text":"It’s a major port facility in the United States.","start":551.759,"stop":555.163,"duration":3.4},{"text":"It’s probably the third or fourth largest port in the United States in terms of tonnage and Philadelphia, perhaps more important than all of these things, is known as a residential city and, of course, it’s a city with problems, very substantial problems, but those problems are being dealt with here notwithstanding all of that.","start":555.163,"stop":578.661,"duration":23.5},{"text":"The respondents came into Court alleging that Mayor Tate was guilty of discrimination on the basis of race making his appointments to this Educational Nominating Panel.","start":578.661,"stop":599.184,"duration":20.52},{"text":"This was proven by the plain -- by the respondents almost entirely on a strictly statistical basis but, at no time in the Court below did the respondents ever proved and that the statistics upon which they relied had any statistical significance.","start":599.184,"stop":623.308,"duration":24.12},{"text":"Not only did they not prove statistical significance, but they never proved the practical and actual significance in an ordinary everyday sense.","start":623.308,"stop":634.263,"duration":10.96},{"text":"What they did prove was that in 1971 Mayor Tate appointed two Blacks out of 13 members to the Nominating Panel.","start":634.263,"stop":646.878,"duration":12.62},{"text":"That from 1965, through the appointments made by the-- in 1971, Blacks were appointed to the Nominating Panel on the basis of an average of two out of thirteen or, in percentages, approximately 15.4%.","start":646.878,"stop":669.398,"duration":22.52},{"text":"They also attempted to prove discrimination in appointments to the Nominating Panel on the basis of alleged discrimination by Mayor Tate in his appointments to city government, and that was purported to be done by establishing from the records produced by the City of Philadelphia that of all of the persons appointed, not necessarily by the Mayor but employed by the City of Philadelphia earning $20,000 or more, that only approximately 9 or 12%, and I’m not -- the particular percentage -- at the moment, were Black as opposed to a population of 33% Black.","start":669.398,"stop":713.795,"duration":44.4},{"text":"And that in the Boards and Commissions the Mayor appointed 12% Blacks as opposed to the same population of 33%.","start":713.795,"stop":723.944,"duration":10.15},{"text":"The respondents went further than that and said that, because the population of the School District in terms of its pupils was approximately 65% Black, that this necessitated some additional consideration of race, I believe in this instance a new category never before sanctioned by any Court, reference to the school population as opposed to the city population of persons who should be considered as eligible for nomination or appointment to the Nominating Panel.","start":723.944,"stop":758.006,"duration":34.06},{"text":"Countering this, the petitioners submitted evidence, first of all, took the position that there was no statistical significance proved and, second of all, submitted evidence that the Mayor’s appointments to various positions in city government, insofar as the relationship between Black and White was concerned, was substantially better than private industry in the same city, substantially better than national averages in the United States, substantially better than other governmental agencies.","start":758.006,"stop":797.698,"duration":39.69},{"text":"More importantly, petitioners put in evidence, which was not contradicted in any way, shape, or form, that the City of Philadelphia’s workforce is 41% Black as opposed to 33% in the population, that 24% of the middle management was Black, that somewhere between 9 and 12% of upper management was Black.","start":797.698,"stop":823.089,"duration":25.39},{"text":"Now from this, of course, the respondents would derive some kind of discriminatory pattern.","start":823.089,"stop":827.621,"duration":4.53},{"text":"However, it was further established that under then Mayor Tate’s regime, as Chief Executive Officer of the City of Philadelphia, the pattern of employment of Blacks in all levels, in the lowest levels, in middle management, in upper management had increased substantially over the 8 or 9 or 10 years that he had been in office.","start":827.621,"stop":852.302,"duration":24.68},{"text":"That he had continually taken pains to ensure that qualified Blacks were continuously appointed and promoted and reappointed and re-promoted as fast as could be done under the circumstances, and without infringing upon the rights of any other person or persons in the community.","start":852.302,"stop":874.273,"duration":21.97},{"text":"The only complaint in essence that respondents have is that, in their view, it wasn’t done fast enough and, because there was some alleged statistical underrepresentation of Blacks, that all of a sudden this had to prove racial discrimination on the part of Mayor Tate but, quite the contrary is true when considered in complete context.","start":874.273,"stop":900.696,"duration":26.42},{"text":"Respondents went one step further.","start":900.696,"stop":903.83,"duration":3.13},{"text":"They said that they proved actual discrimination on the part of Mayor Tate in his appointment, and this goes back then to question of what that evidence was, and bearing in mind that the District Court judge who heard the evidence refused to find actual discrimination.","start":903.83,"stop":924.471,"duration":20.64},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, found that there was evidence of actual discrimination which was not rebutted on the record.","start":924.471,"stop":932.571,"duration":8.1},{"text":"We believe that the Court of Appeals clearly violated Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because the finding or the refusal to find discrimination by the District Court judge was not clearly erroneous and was, in fact, supported by substantial evidence in the record.","start":932.571,"stop":952.079,"duration":19.51},{"text":"The only evidence of alleged actual discrimination was a testimony of W. Wilson Good who said that in 1696, two years before the actions of which complaints now made, Mayor Tate had publicly said at the time the Mayor made a public statement that he was not going to appoint anymore Negroes to the Board because, in his feeling, they had adequate representation and that he was going to appoint someone from the Nominees to the Board of Education.","start":952.079,"stop":984.576,"duration":32.5},{"text":"Well, I submit that that’s a rather thin ice upon which the bottom, a finding of actual discriminatory intent on the part of the Chief Executive Officer of the city of Philadelphia.","start":984.576,"stop":995.48,"duration":10.9},{"text":"Not only is that rather thin evidence, but it was clearly refuted in evidence by the person who had been instrumental in making the appointments acting as an aid to Mayor Tate.","start":995.48,"stop":1009.952,"duration":14.47},{"text":"He specifically said that Mayor Tate was an old warhorse politician, and that he took into account all of the necessary things and his -- one of his primary criterion in making appointments was to be sure that everybody had adequate representation on these kinds of Boards or Commissions, including the Nominating Panel.","start":1009.952,"stop":1035.146,"duration":25.19},{"text":"And, of course, in the final analysis, the question really comes down to, looking at the Educational Nominating Panel itself, considering what it's purpose was, considering what it was intended to do, intended to achieve and how it was intended to achieve it, a finding of discrimination whether inferentially based on statistics of which the significance was never proved or based upon the meager testimony of W. Wilson Good, which was contradicted and which was not accepted by the trial judge who heard the testimony, is grossly unfair to the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia.","start":1035.146,"stop":1076.012,"duration":40.87},{"text":"Indeed, it does more harm to the City of Philadelphia than good in every way, shape, and form that could be imagined or considered.","start":1076.012,"stop":1087.848,"duration":11.84},{"text":"The respondents placed particular emphasis on several decisions of this Court","start":1087.848,"stop":1095.145,"duration":7.3},{"text":"I believe that they rely most strenuously upon Calvin Turner versus Fouche, a decision by this Honorable Court in January of 1970.","start":1095.145,"stop":1109.768,"duration":14.62},{"text":"The difficulty, I believe, with that-- placing reliance upon that case which must, of course, be read in tandem with Carter versus Jury Commissioner of Greene County, is that, there, the issue involved: appointments to a jury panel -- grand jury panel which in turn then appointed a School Board, and the evidence showed rather clearly and dramatically that discrimination was involved in the selection of grand jurors by the Jury Commission.","start":1109.768,"stop":1144.064,"duration":34.3},{"text":"Now, the Jury Commissioners in that case stand essentially on a footing, on the same footing with the Educational Nominating Panel in this case and, interestingly enough, the plaintiffs in that case wanted to set aside the appointment of the Jury Commissioner, and this Court refused to set aside that appointment notwithstanding that all of the Jury Commissioners were White and notwithstanding it was proved that they were guilty of discrimination.","start":1144.064,"stop":1176.855,"duration":32.79},{"text":"In the matter before the Court now, there is not one iota of evidence to establish that the Educational Nominating Panel, the very panel which is being attacked by the respondents, acted in any way in a discriminatory manner in making its recommendations for appointment to the Mayor.","start":1176.855,"stop":1194.806,"duration":17.95},{"text":"There isn’t even a contention made here that the Mayor discriminated in making his appointments to the School Board.","start":1194.806,"stop":1201.15,"duration":6.34},{"text":"That is the Board which was charged with the responsibility of running the school system, not the Educational Nominating Panel.","start":1201.15,"stop":1209.682,"duration":8.53},{"text":"It was simply an instrument to (a) the Mayor in making nominations to the School Board. Of course, the reason why no contention was made to that effect is rather clear.","start":1209.682,"stop":1224.456,"duration":14.77},{"text":"At the present time, 33% of the School Board is Black and, at the time that this case was in suit, 24% was Black, and the School Board has never been without Black representation nor has the Educational Nominating Panel been without Black representation.","start":1224.456,"stop":1240.868,"duration":16.41},{"text":"Indeed, if the criteria sought to be established by respondents were accepted by this Court, we would have an almost insurmountable problem because every recognizable ethnic minority, every recognizable minority of any kind be it Asiatic, be it Italian-American, be it Russian-American, Black-American would have the same right to proportional representation on this panel, but this is a panel of 13 members and that’s an impossibility.","start":1240.868,"stop":1275.335,"duration":34.47},{"text":"Respondents’ witnesses testified, for example, that the Puerto Rican-Americans in the City of Philadelphia were absolutely entitled to representation on this panel.","start":1275.335,"stop":1284.925,"duration":9.59},{"text":"But, the problem with that is that on a proportional basis, they couldn’t be entitled to representation because they represent less than 3% of the population of the City of Philadelphia, and one person on the Educational Nominating Panel represents 8%.","start":1284.925,"stop":1299.94,"duration":15.02},{"text":"So that, they don’t even have enough to say that we’re entitled to half of one person on the panel.","start":1299.94,"stop":1306.105,"duration":6.16},{"text":"And, if we were to accept that proposition, then no person who was Puerto Rican could ever appointed to the panel because he’s not entitled to his proportion on that panel.","start":1306.105,"stop":1317.543,"duration":11.44},{"text":"No person of Chinese-American extraction in the City of Philadelphia could ever be entitled to such representation because although we have a strong and viable Chinese-American community in Philadelphia, it’s small and it’s too small to be entitled to a proportion that share on this panel.","start":1317.543,"stop":1335.664,"duration":18.12},{"text":"And so under those circumstances, it would represent a gross inequity to all other minorities and, indeed, to those who might be considered as a majority, if there is one, in any urban center in the United States today.","start":1335.664,"stop":1347.492,"duration":11.83}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A.
