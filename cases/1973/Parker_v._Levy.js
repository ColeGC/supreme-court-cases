Bork","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.","start":43.113,"stop":45.883,"duration":2.77},{"text":"This appeal, which is obviously similar in many respects to the case we?ve just heard concerns even more obviously I think the values I suggested were protected by Article 134 and here Article 133 as well.","start":45.883,"stop":62.358,"duration":16.47},{"text":"The conduct here is specially egregious and I think it is impossible for anybody to say that the appellee here could not have known, must not have known what he was doing was prejudicial to good order and discipline was not the standard of conduct expected of an officer and gentleman and indeed of course he was also convicted under Article 90 for the direct disobedience of the lawful order of the superior commissioned officer.","start":62.358,"stop":94.674,"duration":32.32},{"text":"Upon conviction, Captain Levy was sentenced to dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for three years at hard labor.","start":94.674,"stop":104.928,"duration":10.25},{"text":"Now, Article 90 as I say provides for the punishment of anyone subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice who willfully disobeys a lawful command of a superior commissioned officer and the specification or charge levied against Captain Levy was that he willfully disobeyed the colonel?s command to establish and operate a phase two training program for Special Forces aide men in dermatology.","start":104.928,"stop":132.915,"duration":27.99},{"text":"And the evidence showed that one of the functions of the hospital to which he was assigned which was Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he went there as soon as he was taken into the service, was to train Special Forces aide men where men capable of giving certain levels of medical service in the field.","start":132.915,"stop":155.159,"duration":22.24},{"text":"Captain Levy was the Chief of the Dermatology Service, in fact he was the only trained dermatologist at that hospital and he had the responsibility to conduct this training.","start":155.159,"stop":163.873,"duration":8.71},{"text":"For a time he did so during early 1966 and then he did so with increasing irregularity and incompleteness.","start":163.873,"stop":171.62,"duration":7.75},{"text":"Reports began to come in to the colonel, Colonel Francey who commanded the hospital the training was not being done adequately.","start":171.62,"stop":177.713,"duration":6.09},{"text":"He investigated and discovered that Captain Levy had by now totally neglected his duties in training aide men.","start":177.713,"stop":186.102,"duration":8.39},{"text":"He called Colonel Levy before him and handed him a written order to conduct the training required.","start":186.102,"stop":192.915,"duration":6.81},{"text":"Captain Levy read the order, announced that he understood it but further announced that he would not obey it because there is medical ethics.","start":192.915,"stop":200.736,"duration":7.82},{"text":"He was told that obedience was nonetheless expected, he persisted in his refusal.","start":200.736,"stop":205.918,"duration":5.18},{"text":"It was interesting in a way because his enlisted subordinates offered to carry out the training for him and he ordered them using his rank as a captain, not to conduct the training of these Special Forces aide men and threatened them with punishment if they disobeyed his order.","start":205.918,"stop":222.756,"duration":16.84},{"text":"The Attorney was determined that nobody was going to receive any training in dermatology in that hospital and he used his rank as an officer to carry out that determination.","start":222.756,"stop":234.335,"duration":11.58},{"text":"He continued to persist over a period of a month or two to obey that order and ultimately disciplinary action in the form of an Article 90 charge was levied against him.","start":234.335,"stop":246.233,"duration":11.9},{"text":"Now, Article 134, as we just heard under which he was also charged prescribes, among other things, as I have said, all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the Armed Forces and all conduct and nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces.","start":246.233,"stop":262.576,"duration":16.34},{"text":"The specification in Article 133 as I have mentioned as the -- provides punishment for conduct of unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.","start":262.576,"stop":271.054,"duration":8.48},{"text":"The specification under 134 is set forth by pages 8 and 9 of our brief and I shall merely mention some of the statements which he made to enlisted men under his command and to others apparently coming through the clinic.","start":271.054,"stop":286.616,"duration":15.56},{"text":"The statements he made orally contain such sentences as, ?I would refuse to go to Vietnam if ordered to do so.","start":286.616,"stop":294.263,"duration":7.65},{"text":"I do not see why any colored soldier would go to Vietnam.","start":294.263,"stop":297.246,"duration":2.98},{"text":"They should refuse to go to Vietnam and if sent should refuse to fight.","start":297.246,"stop":301.656,"duration":4.41},{"text":"If I were a colored soldier I would refuse to go to Vietnam and if I were a colored soldier and I was sent, I would refuse to fight,? and then he referred of course to Special Forces personnel as liars, thieves, killers of peasants, murderers of women and children and so forth.","start":301.656,"stop":314.748,"duration":13.09},{"text":"The specification under Article 133 is much the same, involves the same allegations of the same kinds of remarks.","start":314.748,"stop":326.9,"duration":12.15},{"text":"The evidence showed that during 1966, while he was on duty in the dermatology clinic, on many occasions, Captain Levy made remarks of this nature.","start":326.9,"stop":338.195,"duration":11.3},{"text":"He engaged in conversations, many of them completely one sided with aide men undergoing training with patients and visitors, he did it in the open, in the presence of enlisted men, of civilian personnel and patients.","start":338.195,"stop":355.002,"duration":16.81},{"text":"He was convicted under Articles 90, 133 and 144 and sentenced, as I have said, he exhausted his appeals on the military.","start":355.002,"stop":366.559,"duration":11.56},{"text":"Ultimately, after much litigation he warned up with a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania which denied its petition but the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding Articles 133 and 134 unconstitutionally vague.","start":366.559,"stop":383.237,"duration":16.68},{"text":"It also held, with one Judge, Chief Judge Sykes dissenting that the possibility of prejudice, under Article 90 for the direct disobedience of a lawful order.","start":383.237,"stop":395.499,"duration":12.26},{"text":"Due to the fact that trial have been held under two articles held unconstitutional, required that the Article 90 charge would be overturned and sent back for a new trial.","start":395.499,"stop":406.009,"duration":10.51},{"text":"We brought this case here on appeal.","start":406.009,"stop":408.931,"duration":2.92},{"text":"Now at the outset, I should say that the appellee?s brief raises some 14 numbered points and many of these are, I supposed offered as alternative grounds for affirmance but these were points not addressed or decided by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and we suggest that the proper way to handle this would be that should the Government prevail, on its arguments on 133, 134 and 90, that the proper course should be to remand this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of all these other points which it did not consider or decide and a decision on those issues.","start":408.931,"stop":453.052,"duration":44.12},{"text":"So I will confine myself to the jurisdictional objections raised here and to the argument about the articles themselves.","start":453.052,"stop":463.433,"duration":10.38},{"text":"Captain Levy raises two jurisdictional objections.","start":463.433,"stop":468.132,"duration":4.7},{"text":"The first one is that this is not properly an appeal to the Supreme Court under 28 United States Code Section 1252.","start":468.132,"stop":480.334,"duration":12.2},{"text":"I don?t -- we have explained that in our brief, I don?t think it requires extensive argument here.","start":480.334,"stop":488.441,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The Court noted that the jurisdictional question was reserved and noting probable jurisdiction.","start":488.441,"stop":496.668,"duration":8.23},{"text":"1252 says that any party may appeal to the Supreme Court from an interlocutory or final judgment of any Court of the United States, holding an act of Congress unconstitutionally and on its face.","start":496.668,"stop":513.154,"duration":16.49},{"text":"It provides for an appeal in this kind of a case, the Court of Appeals as any Court.","start":513.154,"stop":517.528,"duration":4.37},{"text":"An act of Congress has been held unconstitutionally.","start":517.528,"stop":520.808,"duration":3.28},{"text":"The Reviser?s notes indicate that this language was deliberately chosen to allow appeals from any Federal Court decision holding an Act of Congress invalid.","start":520.808,"stop":532.054,"duration":11.25},{"text":"In addition to that, we rely upon the fact that Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of a public procedure prescribes a mechanism for notifying the Attorney General constitutional questions arising in Courts of Appeals.","start":532.054,"stop":547.086,"duration":15.03},{"text":"The purpose is to allow the Attorney General to intervene, if a constitutional question about a Federal statute is raised so that he may then take an appeal from any decision against the constitutionality of a federal statute.","start":547.086,"stop":560.38,"duration":13.29},{"text":"So I think it?s quite clear that we are properly here on an appeal.","start":560.38,"stop":564.647,"duration":4.27},{"text":"I think it is also quite clear that under 28 United States Code Section 2103 that if we?re not properly here by a way of appeal, this should be treated as a petition for certiorari and if you go forward.","start":564.647,"stop":577.576,"duration":12.93},{"text":"But there is one other or two other jurisdictional points raised by appellee.","start":577.576,"stop":584.59,"duration":7.01},{"text":"The first one is that a government attorney filed the notice of appeal in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and that government attorney was not an attorney of record in this case.","start":584.59,"stop":596.368,"duration":11.78},{"text":"I don?t know why there?s any objection to the filing of notice of appeal.","start":596.368,"stop":603.076,"duration":6.71},{"text":"This case was tried in the District Court in the Middle of the District of Pennsylvania.","start":603.076,"stop":607.086,"duration":4.01},{"text":"The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is in the third, in the Eastern District and the Department of Justice ordered the Assistant U.S. Attorney in this Eastern District to file a notice of appeal in the Third Circuit.","start":607.086,"stop":622.745,"duration":15.66},{"text":"He was acting as an agent of the Government and I cannot understand what is wrong with that filing of a notice of appeal since we utterly frivolous objection.","start":622.745,"stop":631.544,"duration":8.8},{"text":"The other objection is that a person certifying the service of the notice of appeal, same man who filed it, was not a member of the bar of this Court.","start":631.544,"stop":642.817,"duration":11.27},{"text":"Now Rule 10 of this Court says that these appeals are to be filed in the Court of Appeals in the manner prescribed by Rule 33 of this Court.","start":642.817,"stop":656.066,"duration":13.25},{"text":"That we did as to the manner prescribed.","start":656.066,"stop":659.607,"duration":3.54},{"text":"The Court of Appeals covering the person who must certify rules will seem to -- the Court of Appeals rules cover the person whom was certifies.","start":659.607,"stop":667.573,"duration":7.97},{"text":"So I take it that Rule 33 is questioned as to persons does not apply to this case.","start":667.573,"stop":675.042,"duration":7.47},{"text":"I don?t think there?s any jurisdictional question, I merely discussed it because when it?s raised and the Court notes that it wants to hear about it, I have had an obligation to talk about it unless there is further reason to discuss it, I assume to passed on to the merits.","start":675.042,"stop":694.103,"duration":19.06},{"text":"We have here an Article 134 argument which is much the same as the argument in the average case, and I like to read the page just like part of that quite briefly.","start":694.103,"stop":705.559,"duration":11.46},{"text":"As Mr. Justice White noted, it would be a little hard to attack the statute facially given the fact that as to certain areas, there are decided cases which say these things fall within 134.","start":705.559,"stop":717.721,"duration":12.16},{"text":"So it would hard to strike it down facially on those grounds.","start":717.721,"stop":720.824,"duration":3.1},{"text":"I would suggest also that the Letter Carriers case and Broadrick against Oklahoma certainly indicate that where the statute applies primarily to non-speech activities, facial invalidation may not be called for, is not called for.","start":720.824,"stop":739.619,"duration":18.8},{"text":"Finally, not only our vagueness and overbreadth eliminated by the fact as we?ve already considered, now, I suggest that it takes less than 30 days when one enters the military to perceive that one is in a new and different culture.","start":739.619,"stop":757.401,"duration":17.78},{"text":"Not only the limiting constructions, the contexts, the military function, all of which is obvious to anybody in it, indeed the people outside it.","start":757.401,"stop":766.755,"duration":9.35},{"text":"I want to repeat the fact, which I think is crucial in this case, and that is it would be impossible to write a detailed Code of Conduct under 134 or the Article 133.","start":766.755,"stop":779.575,"duration":12.82},{"text":"I mentioned in the speech area the why -- since we regulate all conduct in the military, unlike the civilian world which is possible to say make a rifle shot statute and say you won?t do that.","start":779.575,"stop":789.609,"duration":10.03},{"text":"We regulate all conduct in the military world, we want affirmative action out of the military in the way we are doing out of the civilian population.","start":789.609,"stop":796.013,"duration":6.4},{"text":"The military has a defined function, it has a goal.","start":796.013,"stop":799.435,"duration":3.42},{"text":"Civilian society has no single goal.","start":799.435,"stop":802.695,"duration":3.26},{"text":"For that reason we regulate everything towards a defined goal, the goal tells us what conduct violates the achievement of that goal, the fact that everything is regulated makes it impossible to write a detailed code.","start":802.695,"stop":816.08,"duration":13.38},{"text":"We have to use words, which men have common understanding, can understand when they realize what kind of a society they are living in and what its object is.","start":816.08,"stop":827.544,"duration":11.46},{"text":"And I suggest again, there are many areas of life, other than the military where we have found it either impossible or not desirable to write a code.","start":827.544,"stop":837.311,"duration":9.77},{"text":"We have, as I say I suggest the Sherman Act, we have had some partial attempts to codify the Sherman Act, and they either turn out to be tumult on antitrust law which is -- does not guide one the details that turned out to be the Robinson-Patman Act.","start":837.311,"stop":857.227,"duration":19.92},{"text":"And those codifications in themselves turn out to be enormously vague.","start":857.227,"stop":861.353,"duration":4.13},{"text":"So I think we are dealing in an area where it is simply impossible to write the detailed code, the rifle shot series of statutes that we would cover every aspect of allowable conduct in the military.","start":861.353,"stop":875.021,"duration":13.67},{"text":"That being true, I think the kind of articles we have here are inevitable and desirable.","start":875.021,"stop":885.584,"duration":10.56},{"text":"It is --","start":885.584,"stop":886.414,"duration":0.83}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
