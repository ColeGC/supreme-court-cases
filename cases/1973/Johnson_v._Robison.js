service and not to anyone else.","start":613.474,"stop":644.192,"duration":30.72},{"text":"Now, we think it claimed that Congress took a different view that Congress realized that there were a number

reserves in connection with the Berlin crisis.","start":711.506,"stop":736.346,"duration":24.84},{"text":"So this was something that was explicitly discussed and it’s a very significant distinction between the two kinds of service because as Congress indicated having this additional liability hanging over his head, a person in the military has a kind of disruption and continuing disruption of his plans and his educational plans.","start":736.346,"stop":759.965,"duration":23.62},{"text":"Now, there is the additional fact that service in the military involves the possibility of being sent

assigned to work for a group base in this country who then might use their services overseas.","start":800.141,"stop":827.18,"duration":27.04},{"text":"There is also a very substantial difference in

told.","start":849.45,"stop":852.706,"duration":3.26},{"text":"However, under the regulations that were in existence in 1965 and 1966 and continued until 1971, a person doing alternative service had considerable opportunity to influence those decisions.","start":852.706,"stop":866.651,"duration":13.94},{"text":"It could as Robison did submit up to three types of employment that he was qualified
