Boyd and Sons, by means of the fraudulent or false invoice.","start":132.573,"stop":151.875,"duration":19.3},{"text":"And the subpoena was directed to the partnership providing for the production of an invoice from the English seller of this glass showing the quantity and quality and value of glass contained in 29 of these 35 cases.","start":151.875,"stop":171.489,"duration":19.61},{"text":"Now, the emphasis Your Honors by the Boyd court that a man’s private papers cannot be used to established a criminal charge against him where the private paper was the invoice of the foreign shipper.","start":171.489,"stop":185.358,"duration":13.87},{"text":"Hardly, as the Government characterizes it in its brief, a partner’s private written statements, this was an invoice from the foreign shipper, first indicates and that the private papers referred to in Boyd didn’t refer to the manner of the preparation or writing by the intimacy of the information contained therein, but rather to the ownership aspect.","start":185.358,"stop":211.15,"duration":25.79},{"text":"First, that this was considered to be the private paper of the claimant of the partnership and the partner standing in the shoes of the partnership.","start":211.15,"stop":220.106,"duration":8.96},{"text":"Of course, as Wilson points out that was never required for Fifth Amendment privilege that the documents be written by the person himself.","start":220.106,"stop":232.628,"duration":12.52},{"text":"In fact that in Wilson, it was emphasized that the mere fact that the officer of the corporation may have written in his own handwriting, the incriminating material in the corporate books in no way would either enlarge or take away from the privilege.","start":232.628,"stop":249.188,"duration":16.56},{"text":"But Your Honors, we submit it’s too much to suggest as I think the Government does that the Boyd court ignored the other aspect of private papers which was involved in Boyd.","start":249.188,"stop":261.997,"duration":12.81},{"text":"That is the private papers’ concept as opposed to those quasi-public records required by law to be kept for regulatory purposes justifying in public scrutiny and you know some area of public domain.","start":261.997,"stop":277.324,"duration":15.33},{"text":"Now, it should be noted that the rationale as we understand it for denying Fifth Amendment protection to corporate books and records lies in the visitorial powers doctrine.","start":277.324,"stop":291.592,"duration":14.27},{"text":"The interest of the States, of the Government to inspect and regulate that state created creatures as exemplified merely by the required records doctrine.","start":291.592,"stop":304.952,"duration":13.36},{"text":"Thus, the Boyd court was well aware what this Court in Hale versus Henkel, 10 years later, only 10 years later held about the required records doctrine when the Boyd court itself observed that what was involved in Boyd, in the private papers aspect was completely different from -- this is the quotation, “the supervision which was authorized to be exercised by revenue officers over the manufacture or custody of excisable articles and the entries there open books required by law to be kept for their inspection.”","start":304.952,"stop":345.171,"duration":40.22},{"text":"Thus, Boyd specifically recognized the distinction between private papers of a partnership and the required records of a corporation with partnership papers assimilated to privately or individually owned.","start":345.171,"stop":362.446,"duration":17.28},{"text":"Furthermore Your Honors, we submit that the White formulation in essence adopts this exact approach.","start":362.446,"stop":370.791,"duration":8.34},{"text":"Now, White recognized the necessity for governmental power to regulate and inspect economically, influential, unincorporated associations such as the union involved therein.","start":370.791,"stop":385.983,"duration":15.19},{"text":"Despite the non-applicability of the visitorial powers doctrine, the privilege applying to recast the White formulation in the affirmative rather than in negative where the organization has a character so personal, that has been substantially identical, in scope of membership and activities, that it can be said to embody or represent the purely, private or personal that is the intimate identical interest of its constituents.","start":385.983,"stop":417.032,"duration":31.05}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Sarner, at one time, Mr. Kolsby and Mr. Wolf had consented to the production of the

denied.","start":458.358,"stop":461.486,"duration":3.13},{"text":"In fact, in my argument before the Court of Appeals Your Honor, I was trying to indicate to the Court what their case did not involve.","start":461.486,"stop":469.344,"duration":7.86},{"text":"It did not in anyway involve a wrongful possession of books as opposed to the other partners.","start":469.344,"stop":475.309,"duration":5.97},{"text":"And the Court of Appeals specifically addressed itself to save the sole issue.","start":475.309,"stop":480.893,"duration":5.58},{"text":"And if you look at page 15 of the appendix
