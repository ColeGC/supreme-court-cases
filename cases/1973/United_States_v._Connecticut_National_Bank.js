banks.","start":414.165,"stop":424.186,"duration":10.02},{"text":"Now, returning then to the situation in Connecticut, I have mentioned that the state’s general deposit situation is highly concentrated, the ten largest banks controlling over 80%.","start":424.186,"stop":437.06,"duration":12.87},{"text":"The same concentration appears in the local markets and it appears particularly in

structure in the state, dominated by the ten largest as we view it, has been changing.","start":471.205,"stop":479.919,"duration":8.71},{"text":"There are two very large banks in Hartford.","start":479.919,"stop":484.624,"duration":4.71},{"text":"They have been expanding steadily in a series of foothold acquisitions and de novo office expansions.","start":484.624,"stop":493.718,"duration":9.09},{"text":"They moved steadily to the point where they are substantially bigger than the next eight banks.","start":493.718,"stop":503.086,"duration":9.37},{"text":"Then you come to another breaking point in the state’s banking structure.","start":503.086,"stop":506.712,"duration":3.63},{"text":"Below the first 10, the banks become quite, become relatively small.","start":506.712,"stop":511.934,"duration":5.22},{"text":"So these first ten banks are probably the place where the strongest competitive potential is concentrated.","start":511.934,"stop":520.854,"duration":8.92},{"text":"The Bridgeport and the New Haven banks that are merging here have been moving toward each others markets.","start":520.854,"stop":530.924,"duration":10.07},{"text":"In fact, they actually were in competition with each other in an area involved in this case, a so-called four town area.","start":530.924,"stop":538.095,"duration":7.17},{"text":"A little to the north of New Haven and somewhat to the east of Bridgeport and that aspect of the case led us to allege that there was a diminution of actual competition, but the defendants proposed to the District Court to divest themselves a certain of those offices and the District Court accepted that offer so that that actual competition factor is not itself an issue in this case.","start":538.095,"stop":569.648,"duration":31.55},{"text":"However, what that actual competition offer does show is that these two banks were coming into conflict with each other.","start":569.648,"stop":577.347,"duration":7.7},{"text":"These are not just potential entrants on some theory of having the capacity to enter the market.","start":577.347,"stop":583.068,"duration":5.72},{"text":"They are next door to each other right now.","start":583.068,"stop":585.472,"duration":2.4},{"text":"They are on

markets.","start":585.472,"stop":599.815,"duration":14.34},{"text":"The District Court rejected our arguments on a number of grounds.","start":599.815,"stop":608.25,"duration":8.43},{"text":"It found first of all that banking in Connecticut -- Commercial banking in Connecticut is not a line of commerce.","start":608.25,"stop":616.23,"duration":7.98},{"text":"It concluded that savings bank competition in Connecticut is so strong as to destroy the distinctiveness of commercial banking or rather, as I shall argue; it concluded there was a broader line of commerce called banking which included both commercial banks and savings banks.","start":616.23,"stop":630.203,"duration":13.97},{"text":"It also concluded that the metropolitan areas in the state of Connecticut are not banking markets.","start":630.203,"stop":643.068,"duration":12.87},{"text":"The only banking market it recognized was the state as a whole.","start":643.068,"stop":648.201,"duration":5.13},{"text":"When we contended that if that is true then the Standards of Philadelphia Bank should apply to the concentration that appears in the state, the court rejected this view on the ground that concentration didn’t really apply here and the defendants now argue that well it doesn’t mean they are in head to head competition, it just means the state as a banking market.","start":648.201,"stop":667.473,"duration":19.27},{"text":"The court concluded that it would be impossible for the defendant banks to enter by any means that the Government had described and I shall come to those.","start":667.473,"stop":682.161,"duration":14.69},{"text":"It concluded that the regulatory factor showed that competition was not seriously injured by any potential competition contention of the Government and finally it sustained the “convenience and needs” defense.","start":682.161,"stop":698.023,"duration":15.86},{"text":"Now before I go to these many issues, I think I should at least try to make an overview of what it is the Government thinks that you are doing in this potential competition cases.","start":698.023,"stop":709.708,"duration":11.68},{"text":"We start with the premise that in the Philadelphia National Bank, this Court concluded that Section 7 applies to banking and that concentration ratio is our primary index to the diminution of competition when banks merge.","start":709.708,"stop":727.062,"duration":17.35},{"text":"This was followed in 1966 by a thorough congressional reexamination of the problem in the Bank Merger Act of 1966.","start":727.062,"stop":736.529,"duration":9.47},{"text":"Out of that came a conclusion that the antitrust laws remained applicable to banking, that antitrust standards should apply in banking, subject to a new defense the convenience and needs defense which was to apply.","start":736.529,"stop":756.145,"duration":19.62},{"text":"The Bank Merger Act of 1966 also provided that the bank regulatory agencies would be permitted to intervene as parties to defend their own decisions.","start":756.145,"stop":767.023,"duration":10.88},{"text":"Now viewing this history, the Government has concluded that Section 7 is extremely important in preventing a consolidation of banking among the various states to the point where only a few institutions dominate all of the states’ banking.","start":767.023,"stop":788.638,"duration":21.62},{"text":"In Connecticut as a whole, the 10 largest banks have been considering merger with each other since 1968.","start":788.638,"stop":796.367,"duration":7.73},{"text":"Since 1969, there have been four mergers approved by the regulatory authorities among the 10 largest banks.","start":796.367,"stop":804.513,"duration":8.15},{"text":"Now the two merging banks here are the fourth and eighth largest in the state and they are right next door to each other.","start":804.513,"stop":810.977,"duration":6.46},{"text":"They have spread to the point where they actually competing with each other.","start":810.977,"stop":814.494,"duration":3.52},{"text":"Each is a big, strong and healthy institution and they are well managed.","start":814.494,"stop":819.58,"duration":5.09},{"text":"They are the dominant local banks, 40% of deposits in their primary markets in Bridgeport and New Haven.","start":819.58,"stop":826.278,"duration":6.7},{"text":"Those markets are concentrated and each bank, therefore, can bring important new competition into the market of the other, if they will come in by independent entry.","start":826.278,"stop":836.723,"duration":10.44},{"text":"Now those markets are attractive and each bank has strong incentives to expand into them.","start":836.723,"stop":843.844,"duration":7.12},{"text":"So long as the attractive and profitable merger route is open, however, large banks will not give serious consideration to alternative means of entry.","start":843.844,"stop":855.875,"duration":12.03},{"text":"Their management, anxious to find merger partners will squelch any proposals for independent entry and their managements will argue that we have to merge with other large banks because we all have to grow until we are as big as the biggest and the result is of course that the biggest becomes the measure of the size of all of the banks and you have a trend that cannot be stopped if this standard is the one to govern.","start":855.875,"stop":883.88,"duration":28},{"text":"This Court rejected that view in Philadelphia Bank and I think it did so
