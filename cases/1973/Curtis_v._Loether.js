Court.","start":10.61,"stop":14.34,"duration":3.73},{"text":"Yesterday afternoon in the course of his discussion of this case, my distinguished opposing counsel, in response to a question by the Chief Justice conceited that if this case is in fact in a nature of a common law action then it cannot escape the reach of the preservative power of the Seventh Amendment.","start":14.34,"stop":36.538,"duration":22.2},{"text":"When court adjourned yesterday afternoon, in response to another question by the Chief Justice, I was responding to how the Seventh Amendment test may be applied to the particular circumstances of this case and I would like to pursue that further this morning.","start":36.538,"stop":54.933,"duration":18.4},{"text":"When we adjourned yesterday, I had concluded my discussion with regard to the first test announced by this court in Ross versus Bernhard, namely, how the circumstances of this case compared -- contrast with the premerger custom of the Federal Courts with respect to like issues.","start":54.933,"stop":76.519,"duration":21.59},{"text":"And, I suggested to the court the test proposed by Justice Story in Parsons versus Bedford to the effect that the Seventh Amendment reaches all cases which are not of equity or admiralty jurisdiction and I also suggested that the literal approach be rejected.","start":76.519,"stop":94.964,"duration":18.44},{"text":"And I would pass on now to the other two tests which were announced in Ross versus Bernhard, namely, what type of relief is requested and, thirdly, third test being the practical abilities and limitations of juries.","start":94.964,"stop":112.269,"duration":17.31},{"text":"The second test, I think, is particularly applicable to this case and this goes back to a question that Justice Brennan asked me yesterday afternoon with respect to what type of relief was asked for.","start":112.269,"stop":123.749,"duration":11.48},{"text":"I recall the Justice asking whether or not actual damages had been asked for in the complaint and the record shows, I believe, that they were not.","start":123.749,"stop":132.105,"duration":8.36},{"text":"However, they did enter the case by way of a pretrial order after the first pretrial conference and, in all subsequent pretrial orders issued by the District Court, this case was announced to be one on damages.","start":132.105,"stop":147.174,"duration":15.07},{"text":"And when it came time for this case to be decided after the trial had been concluded, and I am referring specifically to page 51 (a) of the Appendix, at the top of that page, the District Court said, \"Now, we come to the question, the questions of damages.\"","start":147.174,"stop":165.408,"duration":18.23},{"text":"Further down in that page the District Court said, \"I do not believe there had been any compensatory damages proven in this case

damages.","start":178.51,"stop":181.905,"duration":3.4},{"text":"There had been a trial on compensatory damages.","start":181.905,"stop":184.821,"duration":2.92},{"text":"All the evidence elicited by the plaintiff on direct testimony had related to actual damages.","start":184.821,"stop":190.989,"duration":6.17},{"text":"The plaintiff offered no testimony with respect to the other issue that was being tried, namely the issue of discrimination, because the court had incorporated the testimony that had been elicited at the time of the preliminary injunction on that issue.","start":190.989,"stop":205.921,"duration":14.93},{"text":"Practically, the entire testimony in that two days of trial related to the question of the extent to which if at all, the plaintiff had sustained any actual damages.","start":205.921,"stop":216.468,"duration":10.55},{"text":"And in the final analysis, very specifically, the trial court rejected that claim and went on to award punitive damages in the amount of $250.","start":216.468,"stop":227.423,"duration":10.96},{"text":"And this was a -- this topic was a source of some discussion when this case was argued before the Seventh Circuit and at that time, opposing counsel for the plaintiff conceited to the Seventh Circuit that actual damages were in the case.","start":227.423,"stop":241.29,"duration":13.87},{"text":"Now, why is this important with respect to the second issue in Ross versus

important to the jury issue cause it goes to the abilities of juries.","start":258.793,"stop":268.044,"duration":9.25},{"text":"And I'd point this out that we had two claims for money damages; actual damages, punitive damages.","start":268.044,"stop":273.798,"duration":5.75},{"text":"Both of those are issues that juries are particularly responsive to particularly in determining the extent of damages.","start":273.798,"stop":282.358,"duration":8.56},{"text":"This is one area where Appellate Courts, I find are laws overturn, the finding of juries because that is one of their particular strengths and I think there is probably no damage issue at law that calls upon the common sense judgment of jurors more than the question of whether, and to what extent, punitive damages should be awarded.","start":282.358,"stop":305.355,"duration":23},{"text":"Both of these damage issues were before us at the time the jury trial issue became
