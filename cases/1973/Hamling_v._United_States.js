fact that the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case is under a heavy cloud by reason of the fact that another panel in Henson has reached the opposite conclusion and perhaps equally important is the fact that in another case mentioned in my reply to the Government's opposition to our petition for certiorari at page 2 in London Press, the identical brochure was involved and there are the Ninth Circuit granted a rehearing en banc or ordered a rehearing en banc and that matter has been put over since this Court has now granted certiorari.","start":340.479,"stop":375.567,"duration":35.09},{"text":"The point I make is that the Ninth Circuit itself has expressed a very serious doubt as to the correctness of the judgments in this case.","start":375.567,"stop":385.867,"duration":10.3},{"text":"Our basic point, Your Honor, is that the federal statute, Section 1461 on its face and as construed to pre-Miller conduct simply

not afford the country guidelines when this Court said, “Every obscenity statute would have to have before anyone would be subjected to any criminal prosecution.”","start":404.314,"stop":416.28,"duration":11.97},{"text":"And the defect in the statute as it existed prior to Miller is by fault.","start":416.28,"stop":422.205,"duration":5.93},{"text":"First of all, the statute plainly does not have the specificity which this Court said was an absolute essential to the validity of an obscenity statute, one have only look at the words of the statute to see they talk only in terms of lewd -- obscene, lewd, lascivious and decent, filthy and the like.","start":422.205,"stop":445.68,"duration":23.48},{"text":"It's equally plain that this Court had not hit the floor before Miller had a saving construction of the statute.","start":445.68,"stop":456.205,"duration":10.52},{"text":"If there is, if there'd be, a saving construction of a statute, it would be in Footnote 7 and 12 Reels of Film and there the Court only said that it was prepared in the future to read Miller into the federal statute and if the Court was prepared in the future to do so, it follows inevitably that the Court had not thereto for had the Miller specificity in the statute.","start":456.205,"stop":485.074,"duration":28.87},{"text":"And so, the statute was simply unconstitutionally vague because it did not have what this Court said, “Every obscenity statute would have to have if it was to meet a constitutional requirements.”","start":485.074,"stop":499.549,"duration":14.47},{"text":"Secondly, if the Court please, the authoritative construction of 1461 at the time that the petition is herein were tried and convicted was that national standards had to be used.","start":499.549,"stop":512.317,"duration":12.77},{"text":"National standards had to be used with regard to hate and defensiveness.","start":512.317,"stop":516.477,"duration":4.16},{"text":"National standards had to be used with regard to permanent interest.","start":516.477,"stop":520.707,"duration":4.23},{"text":"But, this Court has said, “There are no national standards.","start":520.707,"stop":524.075,"duration":3.37},{"text":"They are unascertainable.","start":524.075,"stop":525.668,"duration":1.59},{"text":"They are unprovable.","start":525.668,"stop":527.108,"duration":1.44},{"text":"They are

answer the question of obscenity within the framework of national standards was engaged in an exercise in futility.","start":530.765,"stop":540.997,"duration":10.23},{"text":"Therefore, the petitioners here were convicted of offending standards that simply on the Court's own terms do not exists.","start":540.997,"stop":550.683,"duration":9.69},{"text":"The statute in the first place is defective because that is the authoritative construction of the statute as of the time of the trial and the conviction and having read the national standards into the statute and following the -- the logic, methodologically teachings of Miller, we know that national standards simply do not exist.","start":550.683,"stop":577.378,"duration":26.7},{"text":"The statute is also unconstitutionally vague pre-Miller because of the utilization of the utterly without redeeming social value test.","start":577.378,"stop":587.791,"duration":10.41},{"text":"That -- with that regard, the Court said that the test was ambiguous, that it was unworkable.","start":587.791,"stop":595.541,"duration":7.75},{"text":"The Government reads the Court's opinion somewhat differently but as we see it, it makes no difference.","start":595.541,"stop":601.024,"duration":5.48},{"text":"The Government says that the utterly without redeeming social value test was rejected because it imposed an impossible burden upon the Government that the Government could never obtain a constitutionally valid conviction under that standard.","start":601.024,"stop":618.084,"duration":17.06},{"text":"If that be so, their argument really is that the utterly without redeeming social value test is so all encompassing that it affectively nullifies 1461.","start":618.084,"stop":628.936,"duration":10.85},{"text":"And if that be so again, one cannot say that the petitioners had fair notice or concrete guidelines as to what kind of conduct would make them felons and punishable by heavy jail terms.","start":628.936,"stop":643.38,"duration":14.44},{"text":"And finally if the Court please in this regard, at the time of the conduct herein and at the time of trial, the operative test in determining obscenity was the red room test.","start":643.38,"stop":658.382,"duration":15},{"text":"Everybody agrees on this as I understand it, that was no test at all.","start":658.382,"stop":663.017,"duration":4.64},{"text":"It was nothing but a subject of test in which any five members of this Court using their separate test, their own intuitions would to come to a conclusion.","start":663.017,"stop":672.916,"duration":9.9},{"text":"In short, all of the petitioners had to know was how would five justices look at the material at the time that he came before you.","start":672.916,"stop":681.478,"duration":8.56},{"text":"Now, if that be a rule of law, if that's a test that meets due process, I respectfully submit, then due process has a meaning quite different from anything that I had understood before and I always thought that in a free society, a person subject to a law would have to know what reasonable certainty in advance what made his conduct criminal or not criminal and if the rule be that whatever five of nine justices believe is bad then I submit, Your Honors, that there has not been a compliance with due process.","start":681.478,"stop":718.122,"duration":36.64},{"text":"But, even if we -- the Court is not prepared to hold that the statute is unconstitutional and the respects that we have set forth, I respectfully submit, Your Honor, that the indictment in this case is fatally infirm.","start":718.122,"stop":737.031,"duration":18.91},{"text":"The indictment is verbally and fatally infirmed because the indictment follows the statutes word by word.","start":737.031,"stop":744.599,"duration":7.57},{"text":"There is nothing in the indictment which any -- in any way clarifies the ambiguity in the statute itself.","start":744.599,"stop":752.596,"duration":8},{"text":"So if the words obscene, lewd, lascivious et cetera by themselves do not give fair notice and concrete guidelines, then they do not give the fair notice that the Sixth Amendment requires in giving the accused fair notice of that which he is required to defend against.","start":752.596,"stop":775.302,"duration":22.71},{"text":"Now, the Government, if the Court please, has moved to Palladino as the case to point the direction to the solution of the trial here, the case herein, the Government recognizing that it's unfair to convict a person serious charge if he is caught mid stream says “Let's follow Palladino”.","start":775.302,"stop":800.014,"duration":24.71},{"text":"Well, if we follow Palladino, we are entitled, of course, to a reversal because in Palladino, there was a conviction and after remand by this Court, the First Circuit said that fairness required that issue be submitted to the jury and, of course there, there was a national standard, I put aside whether it's correct to submit it to the jury on a national standard or a local standard.","start":800.014,"stop":825.652,"duration":25.64},{"text":"The simple fact is that it was recognized in Palladino that there had to be a submission of the issue to the jury.","start":825.652,"stop":835.811,"duration":10.16},{"text":"Now, it's interesting that in Freedman whether it was also the same conclusion reached by the Tenth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit in Freedman took the view that there had to be a submission to the jury because local standards were to be applied in federal cases.","start":835.811,"stop":853.886,"duration":18.07},{"text":"Now, this is the position that the Government urges for federal prosecutions, the utilization of local standards, our view of it is that if in fact local standards are to be used in federal prosecutions, plainly the petitioners were not tried or convicted under the local standards.","start":853.886,"stop":874.821,"duration":20.94},{"text":"Indeed as we pointed out in our reply brief, our attempt to put in -- to put evidence in with regard to local standard was excluded.","start":874.821,"stop":884.281,"duration":9.46},{"text":"We, for example, had called a witness who had made a survey in the San Diego area with regard to the identical brochure in question and on a scientific basis, she asked 718 people their opinions with regard to the brochure overwhelmingly as the record shows.","start":884.281,"stop":903.819,"duration":19.54},{"text":"They were to view essentially that the brochure as it stood should be allowed to be circulated to the American people generally.","start":903.819,"stop":912.514,"duration":8.7},{"text":"That evidence was excluded however solely on the ground that the only test that was applicable was the national standards and not the local standards.","start":912.514,"stop":926.605,"duration":14.09},{"text":"So that if again, we are to follow the suggestion of the Government that local standards are to be used then plainly, there has to be a reversal in this case.","start":926.605,"stop":937.958,"duration":11.35},{"text":"If we agree that there are national standards that are the appropriate remedy in a Federal Court at least until such time as Congress speaks, then it seems to us that this Court's ruling that there are no national standards has the practical effect of invalidating the federal statute at least in the utilization of national standards.","start":937.958,"stop":958.985,"duration":21.03},{"text":"If the Court please, I would like to reserve the balance of my time until after Mr. Rosenwein has represented the other
