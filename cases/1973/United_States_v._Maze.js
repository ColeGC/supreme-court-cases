on the condition that payment would be made when due.","start":445.361,"stop":472.081,"duration":26.72},{"text":"The indictment alleged that the use of the mails was also part of the

is the emergence of the credit card as a substitute for cash.","start":479.231,"stop":495.698,"duration":16.47},{"text":"Inherent in the three-part type of credit card system, we submit, is the use of the mails.","start":495.698,"stop":503.114,"duration":7.42},{"text":"The use of the mails is a necessary and essential feature of the collection in the billing systems and in the processing of the sales invoices.","start":503.114,"stop":513.77,"duration":10.66},{"text":"It is common knowledge and I believe anyone over 21, like respondent who was 31, to charge to collect goods with the credit card knows that, first, the card is a national card.","start":513.77,"stop":524.295,"duration":10.52},{"text":"He knows too that the invoices must be sent to the card issuing company and in many instances, that’s across state lines, for payment and then to the owner.","start":524.295,"stop":535.534,"duration":11.24},{"text":"In Pereira, this Court established a broad test for determining whether a defendant, in setting in motion a chain of events which results in the use of the mails by another, has caused a mailing within the meaning of the mail fraud statute.","start":535.534,"stop":552.321,"duration":16.79},{"text":"And the Court held in Pereira, “where one doesn’t act with knowledge that the use of the mails will follow in the ordinary course of business or where such use can reasonably be foreseen even though not actually intended, then he causes the mails to be used.”","start":552.321,"stop":573.231,"duration":20.91},{"text":"But the Sixth Circuit already has conceded the respondent had caused the mailing of the purchase receipts to the Louisville Bank from the motel in the sense that the court said that he should reasonably have foreseen that this use of the mails would necessarily occur.","start":573.231,"stop":591.835,"duration":18.6},{"text":"But it, nevertheless, held that these mailings were not a significant factor in the success of the scheme.","start":591.835,"stop":601.067,"duration":9.23},{"text":"We respectfully submit that these mailings were an integral part of the respondent’s scheme because with the delay caused by the mails, it enabled him to go on longer with the scheme and enabled him to avoid detection.","start":601.067,"stop":620.806,"duration":19.74},{"text":"At the core of any successful credit card scheme or any credit card involving a single illegal purchase is the necessary delay in detecting the fraud.","start":620.806,"stop":633.77,"duration":12.96},{"text":"The respondent should reasonably have foreseen that the use of the mails would prevented apprehension than being immediate anyway.","start":633.77,"stop":641.554,"duration":7.78},{"text":"And detection effort
