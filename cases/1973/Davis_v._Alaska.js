identification.","start":491.051,"stop":505.411,"duration":14.36},{"text":"Particularly Investigator Gray was asked, did you at any time suspect Green to be involved in this

was.","start":535.774,"stop":544.709,"duration":8.93},{"text":"The protective order of course came during the voir dire examination, so any mention of the problem, the juvenile record would not come before the jury.","start":544.709,"stop":555.357,"duration":10.65},{"text":"In closing the argument, the prosecution stated that the petitioner's entire defense, which -- our entire defense was that the Green's identification was unreliable, that he was under pressure.","start":555.357,"stop":569.041,"duration":13.68},{"text":"We tried to show just by the fact that he was -- the safe was found on his property next to his truck that he would be under pressure.","start":569.041,"stop":574.676,"duration":5.63},{"text":"That was our defense, this was developed an opening statement throughout the trial and closing argument.","start":574.676,"stop":580.199,"duration":5.52},{"text":"The prosecution in the closing argument claimed that this was a total red herring issue, one that we had just made up and that there is no basis for this belief.","start":580.199,"stop":590.552,"duration":10.35},{"text":"He also said and I am referring to pages 422 and 424 of the transcript that our defense of bias and prejudice in fear and favor on part of Green came as a result of pure suspicion of society and suspicion of law enforcement officers.","start":590.552,"stop":609.369,"duration":18.82},{"text":"Of course, the prosecutor must have known in his own mind, at least, the origins of our attack on witness Green's credibility and any bias or any fear and favor he had in testifying, that came from other independent sources than that.","start":609.369,"stop":628.035,"duration":18.67},{"text":"As a result of Green's identification at the station house, his search warrant was obtained for the car belonging to petitioner Joshua Davis.","start":628.035,"stop":639.963,"duration":11.93},{"text":"A search was made of

inferentially relating petitioner's car to being present perhaps at the scene or actually with having had a safe, perhaps, in the trunk of the rented car at one time as to extent of the other evidence presented against petitioner at trial.","start":655.102,"stop":678.356,"duration":23.25},{"text":"The actual evidence in the trunk of the car were insulation fibers that could have come from a safe and paint chips that could have come from the safe.","start":678.356,"stop":688.811,"duration":10.46},{"text":"This was the extent of the identification of these particular substances.","start":688.811,"stop":693.685,"duration":4.87},{"text":"There was no -- there were no fibers or paint chips found on petitioner's clothing or on shoes or nor was the money found that was

evidence.","start":706.863,"stop":714.222,"duration":7.36},{"text":"This is important, of course, to lead to the significance of Green's identification, the crucial nature, the essential nature of his testimony.","start":714.222,"stop":723.9,"duration":9.68},{"text":"Its essential nature, I do not believe is actually in dispute.","start":723.9,"stop":727.227,"duration":3.33},{"text":"It was admitted at trial during the motion for a protective order described as essential witness with that very word.","start":727.227,"stop":735.192,"duration":7.97},{"text":"Also, the Alaska Supreme Court in their opinion described him as an essential witness, that the case could not have been made without him.","start":735.192,"stop":751.318,"duration":16.13},{"text":"The trial judge ruled on the issue, on the basis strictly of the state statute and the rule involved.","start":751.318,"stop":758.55,"duration":7.23},{"text":"He initially was inclined to rule in our favor as the record reflects and stated when he reversed himself that he really didn't agree with what he was doing, but he felt constrained to do so by a specific court rule in Alaska and which is cited, of course, he is
