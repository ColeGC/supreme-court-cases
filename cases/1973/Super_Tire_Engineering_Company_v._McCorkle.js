that there should be a different mootness test for labor controversies or for controversies where the government is a defendant rather than a plaintiff or whether we should have a series of variables

appropriate.","start":543.261,"stop":548.177,"duration":4.92},{"text":"They said the test are whether there is a possibility of an effective judicial decree, second, whether the controversy is

Moore test, where this is a recurring controversy that is likely to evade judicial review.","start":548.177,"stop":569.661,"duration":21.48},{"text":"We think that under any of those four standards in
