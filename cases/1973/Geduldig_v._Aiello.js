Court.","start":66.605,"stop":69.9,"duration":3.3},{"text":"This case is here brought by California on appeal from the decision of the three-judge Court, holding unconstitutional the exclusion of Section 2626 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code which excludes pregnancy from coverage under the Disability Insurance Program.","start":69.9,"stop":91.601,"duration":21.7},{"text":"The cost impact of this decision is estimated to be a minimum of a $120 million annually, based on the current level of operations of the disability funds.","start":91.601,"stop":103.562,"duration":11.96},{"text":"And the question we present to this Court is whether a state can establish a Disability Insurance Program which compensates wage loss from illness and injury but not for normal pregnancy without violating the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses of the Constitution, when there is neither discriminatory intent in the creation of the fund nor discriminatory impact in its operation.","start":103.562,"stop":131.061,"duration":27.5},{"text":"In order for the Court to understand how this case arises, I would like just very briefly to describe how the fund was originated and developed.","start":131.061,"stop":141.14,"duration":10.08},{"text":"In 1946, California became the second state to adopt a Disability Insurance Program.","start":141.14,"stop":148.193,"duration":7.05},{"text":"This arose primarily because during the Second World War, enormous surpluses had build up in the unemployment insurance fund in California because there is virtually no unemployment during the war years and the governor proposed that the 1% which employees had to contribute to that fund should be shifted to provide disability insurance instead.","start":148.193,"stop":170.708,"duration":22.51},{"text":"And the governor in his message explained why he thought that 1% should be the figure and why, since it was coming from employees, it should be kept low, and that is that an employer can always pass along whatever is charged to him in terms of the cost of doing of his business in terms of providing a service or cost of goods but to an employee, there is no one else to pass the charge and as to him it amounts to a gross income tax.","start":170.708,"stop":200.452,"duration":29.74},{"text":"It should be borne in mind of course that there is no employer contribution to this particular fund, that was an illustrative example only.","start":200.452,"stop":209.274,"duration":8.82},{"text":"Well, the Disability Insurance Program has been financed within the limits of that 1% and this was accomplished primarily as a result of incorporating certain features in the California plan that were different from the Rhode Island plan which was the only model that California had to go by at that time.","start":209.274,"stop":228.114,"duration":18.84},{"text":"Rhode Island had begun paying benefits in 1943 and by 1946, in the middle of the year, they had gone from a $2.7 billion surplus to a $1.5 million deficit and there were primarily two factors, omissions really from the Rhode Island plan that accounted for this financial problem.","start":228.114,"stop":253.531,"duration":25.42},{"text":"The first was that they had not provided for the prevention of double recovery, it was possible under the Rhode Island plan to recover both workman’s compensation disability and unemployment disability for the same illness, and secondly, they had included pregnancy coverage.","start":253.531,"stop":272.688,"duration":19.16},{"text":"Pregnancy benefits posed a larger problem for Rhode Island and really amounted to more than twice what was paid for the workman’s compensation duplication.","start":272.688,"stop":282.921,"duration":10.23},{"text":"The California plan made changes in both of those features.","start":282.921,"stop":287.323,"duration":4.4},{"text":"Section 2629 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code prevents the double recovery and Section 2626 excluded pregnancy until 28 days after determination of pregnancy.","start":287.323,"stop":306.892,"duration":19.57},{"text":"Now the reason I used that in the past tense is that last year, that section was amended and it now

for men employees have remained $3.25 per employee per month.","start":359.798,"stop":368.63,"duration":8.83},{"text":"The rate for women was always a little higher and this simply is standard in the

base period as California has a limitation on what the employee can be charged.","start":381.603,"stop":394.023,"duration":12.42},{"text":"Hawaii has a limitation on what the employee can be charged and so the increase in cost in Hawaii will be picked up by a charge to employers but that charge is enormous, as I say in the case of men the rate has not changed.","start":394.023,"stop":408.628,"duration":14.6},{"text":"It is $3.25 per man per month.","start":408.628,"stop":411.929,"duration":3.3},{"text":"For a woman, it has gone from $4.00 per woman per month to $8.76 per woman per month and the only thing that has changed is the inclusion of pregnancy.","start":411.929,"stop":424.718,"duration":12.79},{"text":"I might also mention that New Jersey provides a maximum of eight weeks of benefits, four weeks before birth and four weeks after birth, that’s the maximum and the New Jersey experience is that between 49 and 57% of its fund go to pay for pregnancy benefits.","start":424.718,"stop":445.874,"duration":21.16}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"And those two states do pay for pregnancy to any of the other three

impact that has ultimately.","start":492,"stop":500.427,"duration":8.43},{"text":"Well, California incorporated the features that it could from Rhode Island in order to enable it to carry out an essential purpose to the fund.","start":500.427,"stop":511.572,"duration":11.14},{"text":"The essential purpose to the California disability plan is to provide at low cost a fund which provides benefits having significant levels of benefits.","start":511.572,"stop":522.681,"duration":11.11},{"text":"They’ve always been a fairly healthy wage continuation and to provide broad coverage, to help as many employees as could be helped.","start":522.681,"stop":532.493,"duration":9.81},{"text":"The plan pays out virtually all of its income in benefits.","start":532.493,"stop":537.264,"duration":4.77},{"text":"In the past five years for example, the ratio of payout to benefits has been 90% in the range of 90% of income to 103% of income.","start":537.264,"stop":550.016,"duration":12.75},{"text":"The plan provides for comprehensive benefits, as I have indicated but it does contain actually three exclusions.","start":550.016,"stop":557.059,"duration":7.04},{"text":"One is, and they are all based on the inordinately high cost of providing them, based on actuarial standards common in the insurance industry.","start":557.059,"stop":566.32,"duration":9.26},{"text":"The first is the short-term disability.","start":566.32,"stop":569.012,"duration":2.69},{"text":"Unless you have a waiting

exclusion is the disability that endures more than 26 weeks.","start":583.61,"stop":588.645,"duration":5.03},{"text":"That does not matter whether he is in the hospital or not, that’s simply the maximum benefits allowable and the third one is the pregnancy exclusion.","start":588.645,"stop":597.774,"duration":9.13},{"text":"As I have indicated, the experience of the California fund is much like that of the disability insurance industry generally.","start":597.774,"stop":607.311,"duration":9.54},{"text":"It soon became apparent that it did result in women deriving substantially more benefits than men.","start":607.311,"stop":615.363,"duration":8.05},{"text":"This results primarily because we do have the flat rate and so when you have a situation in which you charge people a flat rate and you have the standard in the insurance industry that women file more disability claims, the impact of that is that women derive substantially more benefits than they make contributions.","start":615.363,"stop":635.973,"duration":20.61}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"But it is a flat percentage, isn’t it rather than a flat

that there were two suits, one brought in the Federal District Court, the other brought in the California Supreme Court by petition for writ of mandate.","start":699.796,"stop":712.066,"duration":12.27},{"text":"Both alleged that the exclusion of pregnancy amounted to a denial of equal protection.","start":712.066,"stop":717.563,"duration":5.5},{"text":"Since the California Court had already ruled on the constitutionality of its statute, in a case called Clark versus California Employment Stabilization Commission, the cases were transferred and consolidated in Federal Court, a three-judge Court was convened and the matter was heard on cross-motions for summary judgment.","start":717.563,"stop":740.409,"duration":22.85},{"text":"Now, I want to make one point from the California case because I think it's key in terms of what we see as the rationale for exclusion of pregnancy.","start":740.409,"stop":751.217,"duration":10.81},{"text":"In the Clark case, the state court said that the legislature was entitled to consider “Whether the objects of the statute would be best served by including a disability benefit which reasonably might impose upon a majority of employees, a burden disproportionate to contemplated benefits in order to favor the minority who are included within the classified group.”","start":751.217,"stop":775.045,"duration":23.83},{"text":"In other words, the Court was concerned that the pregnancy benefits would result in a disproportionate amount of benefits going to a subgroup and that is exactly what has happened in other states and it’s exactly what we predict will happen in California.","start":775.045,"stop":791.533,"duration":16.49},{"text":"The Federal Court, the Federal three-judge Court equated the classification of pregnancy as one based on sex and held that it denied equal protection to pregnant women and also held that pregnancy benefits could not be excluded simply on the basis of cost.","start":791.533,"stop":809.689,"duration":18.16},{"text":"As we have indicated, it is not simply cost.","start":809.689,"stop":812.413,"duration":2.72},{"text":"It’s the combination of factors that make up the California

include pregnancy in our disability insurance plan.","start":923.075,"stop":952.61,"duration":29.53},{"text":"We say, California says that the equal protection doesn’t compel it because the Equal
