procedure.","start":881.09,"stop":901.566,"duration":20.48},{"text":"We note that in the Gateway decision, Mr. Justice Powell noted that the parties could, if they chose, negotiate a broad grievance

the subject matter of dispute maybe within that narrow confine that’s not subject to arbitration promotes the policies of the Act rather than to do them violence because the underlying purpose of the Act of course is to promote industrial peace and harmony and to reduce interruptions of work through strikes and work stoppages.","start":926.884,"stop":959.871,"duration":32.99},{"text":"The whole underlying purpose of the Taft-Hartley Amendment was to equalize the bargaining positions and the enforceability of collective bargaining agreements as between employers and unions because at that point, employers had little incentive to enter into collective bargaining agreements, if they could not have them enforced, and therefore, came the Section 301 jurisdiction which it seems clear takes into its sphere not only legal relief, but equitable relief.","start":959.871,"stop":997.535,"duration":37.66},{"text":"The legislative history of that seems somewhat
