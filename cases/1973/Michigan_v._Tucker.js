application of the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree doctrine.","start":472.115,"stop":478.645,"duration":6.53},{"text":"And more specifically, we raise the question, whether the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree

precise question of witness testimony being suppressed under the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree doctrine as yet to be presented to this Court and I take that lead from the footnote in Harrison versus

would be unwarranted extension of that particular doctrine.","start":514.601,"stop":523.12,"duration":8.52},{"text":"It would be unwarranted because the immediate distinction is that in this type of situation with Henderson, we have the testimony of a live witness.","start":523.12,"stop":531.508,"duration":8.39},{"text":"And I do not feel that we should automatically equate a live witness and all of that and suggest the fact that he has own, a memory, and his own perception and his own will and his own intellect which are all going to interact down there when personally he takes his stand.","start":531.508,"stop":546.346,"duration":14.84},{"text":"We should not equate that type of a human being with physical evidence automatically because we have at least that distinguishing characteristics which makes a human being unique.","start":546.346,"stop":557.415,"duration":11.07},{"text":"Arguably is the fact that this witness when he comes into Court and takes the stand, he’s going to be subject to the rigors of cross examination by defense counsel.","start":557.415,"stop":565.164,"duration":7.75},{"text":"He is subject to impeachment and all the other devices that defense counsel has to cross examine and that this was done in the case of Henderson when he took the stand before the jury.","start":565.164,"stop":577.221,"duration":12.06},{"text":"And that he -- a witness has the ability to have come forward on his own possibly as contrary to physical evidence, but I think more importantly is the fact that when Henderson’s name was brought up by the defendant Tucker, at that point, the name Henderson was at no evidentiary value as such.","start":577.221,"stop":597.877,"duration":20.66},{"text":"It is not evidence the mere mentioning of a name.","start":597.877,"stop":600.498,"duration":2.62},{"text":"It is not evidence per se.","start":600.498,"stop":602.141,"duration":1.64},{"text":"By the independent labors of the police who sought him out and talked to him, at that point, he begins to become significance and when he comes in the Court and testifies, he then becomes evidence.","start":602.141,"stop":611.825,"duration":9.68},{"text":"And I believe this Court, addressed this particular problem in a case one week after Miranda which would be June 20, 1966 in Schmerber.","start":611.825,"stop":620.657,"duration":8.83},{"text":"In the case -- in the language in Schmerber said that, “the privilege against self-incrimination is abide to compelling one to be a witness to give testimony,” but the Court went on to say but it is not a bar against that compulsion which makes the witness or the defendant or the accused the source of real or physical evidence.","start":620.657,"stop":639.661,"duration":19},{"text":"And in this case, Tucker was the source we admit of Henderson’s identity, but it is not evidence the mere mentioning of that name.","start":639.661,"stop":649.231,"duration":9.57},{"text":"The Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine rather than being extended should be curtailed and I think is being curtailed in decisions by this Court.","start":649.231,"stop":658.047,"duration":8.82},{"text":"And I would say to Court, couple of the prime examples would be the case of Harris versus New York in 1970 when the Court permitted the prosecution to use for impeachment at the prior statement of the defendant which it was not being permitted to use in itscase, case in chief.","start":658.047,"stop":673.518,"duration":15.47},{"text":"Even though, I think there would be the illegal fruit, it was still being -- the prosecutor was is being allowed some use of it.","start":673.518,"stop":680.201,"duration":6.68},{"text":"In U.S versus Calandra evidence which was illegally obtained during an illegal search and seizure was still being permitted to be brought before a grand jury for the use of that grand jury in its investigation.","start":680.201,"stop":691.164,"duration":10.96},{"text":"The Court -- this Court has developed as well as some of the lower Federal District Courts, I think theories which are now doctrines of law which permit or avoid the harsh application of the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine; such theories as attenuation or the independent source.","start":691.164,"stop":709.909,"duration":18.75},{"text":"These rules are being carved out judicially from the announced doctrine in order to avoid the extreme and I think harsh application of the automatic exclusion of evidence by the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine.","start":709.909,"stop":720.907,"duration":11},{"text":"But in the case that we have, in the case of Michigan versus Tucker, to apply the Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine and the purpose of that application of that doctrine is to deter unlawful police conduct.","start":720.907,"stop":734.695,"duration":13.79},{"text":"In this particular instance, it would be itself unreasonable and unfair because the police first of all would not have engaged in any misconduct.","start":734.695,"stop":742.496,"duration":7.8},{"text":"The interrogation of Tucker met the standards then in force under Escobedo.","start":742.496,"stop":747.223,"duration":4.73},{"text":"And secondly, when they went out to talk to Henderson, this witness, they were following what was the alibi of the defendant.","start":747.223,"stop":754.539,"duration":7.32},{"text":"The defendant had given a exculpatory remark and the police went out to check that alibi.","start":754.539,"stop":759.224,"duration":4.69},{"text":"And how they checked out, it would have been a good probable belief that Tucker would have released had his alibi been confirmed and if the police had ignored that exculpatory remark, they would have been developed that responsibility.","start":759.224,"stop":774.108,"duration":14.88},{"text":"The final issue that we have raised in
