state.","start":562.377,"stop":580.204,"duration":17.83},{"text":"And finally, the Court held that even if this merger had, as he discussed, the Court describe that some oral of the anticompetitive

last term in the Falstaff case, this Court left open the question as it phrased it, whether a merger would violate Section 7 on the ground that the acquiring company and I now quote “could but did not

manner.”","start":606.206,"stop":634.822,"duration":28.62},{"text":"We think this case presents that question and we urge that the Court should answer it affirmatively, and then, on the principle, it
