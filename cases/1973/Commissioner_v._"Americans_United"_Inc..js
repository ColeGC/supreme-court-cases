it.","start":719.256,"stop":721.484,"duration":2.23},{"text":"There’s no doubt that it did increase the burden, but it seems to us that the main thrust of this lawsuit is to prevent -- or the

depriving Americans United of contributions.","start":737.677,"stop":742.546,"duration":4.87},{"text":"The actual effect, however, would be to prevent the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from
