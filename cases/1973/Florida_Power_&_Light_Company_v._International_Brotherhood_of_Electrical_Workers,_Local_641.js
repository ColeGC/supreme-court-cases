all of the supervisors, whose discipline was at issue, were not only Supervisors within the meaning of Section 2 (11) of the National Labor Relations Act, but were management representatives within the meaning of Section 8 (b) (1) (B), i.e., they had grievance adjustment and/or collective bargaining functions.","start":407.317,"stop":431.866,"duration":24.55},{"text":"The Board with one member dissenting held that the Unions violated Section 8 (b) (1) (B) by disciplining those supervisors for performing a rank-and-file work during the strike, and entered an appropriate remedial

orders.","start":449.178,"stop":458.496,"duration":9.32},{"text":"Now, we start with Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act which, as I indicated, mixed at an unfair labor practice for a Union to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.","start":458.496,"stop":476.798,"duration":18.3},{"text":"Now there’s no question that this clearly prescribes direct Union pressure of an employer, for example is strike threat, to force it to change the identity of its chosen collective bargaining or grievance adjustment representative.","start":476.798,"stop":493.31,"duration":16.51},{"text":"Now in Oakland Mailers, decided in 1968, the Board, for the first time, was confronted with the problem of whether or not Section 8 (b) (1) (B) would also cover the indirect pressure that results from union discipline of a supervisor member who has collective bargaining and grievance adjustment functions for the manner in which he performs those duties.","start":493.31,"stop":532.64,"duration":39.33},{"text":"And the Board concluded that it did on the theory that such discipline would tend to make the supervisor responsive or subservient to the Union’s will and thereby deprive the employer of his full allegiants.","start":532.64,"stop":546.684,"duration":14.04},{"text":"So that as a practical matter, the employer would either after replace that supervisor or the call to board face the fact to all non-representation by him.","start":546.684,"stop":558.145,"duration":11.46},{"text":"Now the court below agrees, although the Union does not, that Section 8 (b) (1) (B) may properly be construed to interdict such indirect pressure on the employer.","start":558.145,"stop":572.045,"duration":13.9},{"text":"As the Court of Appeals pointed out although Section 8 (b) (1) (B) speaks literally in terms of coercing the selection of employer or representatives, it is clear that management’s right to a free selection would be hollow indeed.","start":572.045,"stop":589.956,"duration":17.91},{"text":"And I’m quoting for the Court “If the Union could dictate the matter in which the selected representative performed his collective bargaining and grievance adjustment functions.”","start":589.956,"stop":603.125,"duration":13.17},{"text":"Now, the court below, however, that is the majority of the court, concluded that this reasoning does not all true whereas here a supervisor is disciplined for performing rank-and-file work during the strike.","start":603.125,"stop":622.24,"duration":19.12},{"text":"And the Court’s argument is that when a supervisor forsakes his supervisory role to do rank-and-file work, he is no longer acting as a management representative.","start":622.24,"stop":637.302,"duration":15.06},{"text":"And that there’s a clear-cut dividing line between supervisory and non-supervisory work, and accordingly, there is no reason to believe that by being forced to take sides with the union, a supervisor will suffer from a change of attitude when after the strike he returns to his normal supervisory duties.","start":637.302,"stop":662.853,"duration":25.55},{"text":"Now, we submit, as the dissenting judges below correctly observed the position of the majority of the court below reflects on unrealistic view of the role of the strike in the collective bargaining process, because just as a union seeks to strengthen its hand at the bargaining table by bringing the company’s operations to a halt, so management in order to hold out for the terms it wants, seeks to counter this pressure by keeping operations going, and the performance of rank-and-file work during the strike by supervisors and other management representatives is a vital part of such a company effort.","start":662.853,"stop":713.621,"duration":50.77},{"text":"So that insofar as the supervisor is called upon by the employer to assist him in keeping the plant running.","start":713.621,"stop":725.803,"duration":12.18},{"text":"He is acting as a management representative and to discipline him for such activity, we submit, the Board could reasonably conclude, could have a lingering effect that would affect the future performance of his supervisory duties.","start":725.803,"stop":757.381,"duration":31.58},{"text":"Now, this reading of Section 8 (b) (1) (B), we submit, furthers Congress’s intention with respect to the status of the supervisory employees under the Act.","start":757.381,"stop":771.286,"duration":13.9},{"text":"Only yesterday this Court in the Bell Aerospace decision noted the fact that in 1947, Congress sought to assure employers of the undivided loyalty of their supervisors which it believed had been jeopardized by this Court’s holding in Packard that foremen were employees under the Wagner Act and constituted an appropriate unit for collective bargaining.","start":771.286,"stop":801.926,"duration":30.64},{"text":"Congress believe that the inclusion of Supervisors into organization’s composed of or subservient to the man that they supervised tended to blur the line between management and laborer, and to upset the balance of collective bargaining.","start":801.926,"stop":825.488,"duration":23.56},{"text":"And Congress, the legislative history indicates, was concerned about this result during a strike no less than in other times, because there’s repeated reference in the legislative history to the fact that even when foremen organized in a union of their own, they were nonetheless in a strike situation subservient to the rank-and-file unions.","start":825.488,"stop":854.232,"duration":28.74},{"text":"That the foremen’s association had indeed adopted a formal policy, forbidding its members when the rank-and-file union struck -- to enter to struck plants and protect and maintain them without the concurrence of the rank-and-file.","start":854.232,"stop":870.388,"duration":16.16},{"text":"Now, Congress, in effort to restore this balance, excluded through supervisors from the definition of the employee enhanced from the protection of the Act.","start":870.388,"stop":885.087,"duration":14.7},{"text":"And this relieve the employer of the obligation recognized in Packard to bargain collectively with the union representing its supervisors, and also to insist that the supervisors, under pain of discharge, leave the union.","start":885.087,"stop":908.74,"duration":23.65},{"text":"Now, this insistence however, namely that the supervisors leave the union, is not practicable in many industries, such as the construction industry, the printing industry and the utility industry here where rank-and-file employees are highly organized.","start":908.74,"stop":934.045,"duration":25.3},{"text":"Supervisors are picked from the rank-and-file and they’re unwilling to give up their union membership, because this could result in the forfeiture of substantial pension and other benefits.","start":934.045,"stop":947.964,"duration":13.92},{"text":"And moreover, they may return to rank-and-file status in the future.","start":947.964,"stop":952.815,"duration":4.85},{"text":"On some jobs, they may be supervisor in other jobs or rank-and-file worker.","start":952.815,"stop":963.422,"duration":10.61}]},{"speakerName":"William J.
