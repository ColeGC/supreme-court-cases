Circuit.","start":20.084,"stop":29.815,"duration":9.73},{"text":"The case presents rather a narrow question, namely, which parties can sue for alleged violations of the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, the Amtrak Act.","start":29.815,"stop":41.755,"duration":11.94},{"text":"We claim, petitioner’s claim that under the statutory language and pursuant to the Congressional intent, only the Attorney General and where a labor agreement is involved, employees and their representatives can sue for these alleged violations.","start":41.755,"stop":59.834,"duration":18.08},{"text":"Respondent which is an association of railroad passengers, claims that anyone who is injured and aggrieved by an alleged violation of the Act can bring suit to Federal District Court.","start":59.834,"stop":71.744,"duration":11.91},{"text":"That really is the only issue before the Court this morning.","start":71.744,"stop":76.295,"duration":4.55},{"text":"Before I go into the facts of the immediate case, I’d like to give you just a brief background of the Act itself because it bears on the problem.","start":76.295,"stop":84.379,"duration":8.08},{"text":"This Act was passed because of a genuine concern on behalf of the Congress and the people that all intercity passenger traffic in this country was going to disappear.","start":84.379,"stop":96.978,"duration":12.6},{"text":"In 1929, there were 20,000 passenger trains in this country.","start":96.978,"stop":102.212,"duration":5.23},{"text":"And by 1970, there were only 360.","start":102.212,"stop":106.368,"duration":4.16},{"text":"The plain, hard, cold fact of the matter is that the passengers in this country simply could not pay the high cost of operating this train.","start":106.368,"stop":115.853,"duration":9.49},{"text":"At the same time, Congress in passing the Act did not intend to stop all discontinuances of trains.","start":115.853,"stop":124.266,"duration":8.41},{"text":"Quite to the contrary, it recognized that some additional paring was in order if any rail passenger traffic was going to be preserved.","start":124.266,"stop":133.07,"duration":8.8}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"That’s P-A-R-I-N-G or P-A-I-R, paring?","start":133.07,"stop":136.986,"duration":3.92}]},{"speakerName":"E.

Barrett Prettyman, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Some additional cutting down, yes sir.","start":140.663,"stop":143.508,"duration":2.84},{"text":"Therefore Congress devised a rather elaborate plan, purpose of which was instead of the individual railroads hereafter deciding which train and when it was going to submit the ICC for paring down, instead the Secretary of Transportation would construct a basic system of passenger service.","start":143.508,"stop":165.658,"duration":22.15},{"text":"The minimum system that the country should have and that would consist therefore of all essential service which hopefully would be preserved.","start":165.658,"stop":176.401,"duration":10.74},{"text":"And a corporation was formed, Amtrak, which was given power to enter into contracts with various -- to railroads and take over their passenger service to be funded by government funds, tickets, and the railroads themselves paying entry fees.","start":176.401,"stop":194.778,"duration":18.38},{"text":"The corporation, Amtrak would operate this basic system and would either operate or discontinue the excess service above the basic system.","start":194.778,"stop":204.534,"duration":9.76},{"text":"I’d like to emphasize again now that the purpose of the Act was not to preserve all passenger service but rather in the words of the House Report to effect a rational reduction of present service in order to save any passenger service.","start":204.534,"stop":221.833,"duration":17.3},{"text":"When the Act became effective, the Secretary of Transportation did designate the basic system, a 21-city pairs (P-A-I-R) with 42 trains running daily as part of the basic system as it developed.","start":221.833,"stop":237.489,"duration":15.66},{"text":"When Amtrak took over passenger service, it actually operated originally some 180-passenger trains and today that’s up to a 198.","start":237.489,"stop":247.729,"duration":10.24},{"text":"The Central of Georgia’s only remaining passenger trains just prior to the passage of this Act were the Nancy Hanks between Savannah and Atlanta and Trains 13 and 14 between Albany, Georgia and Birmingham.","start":247.729,"stop":262.548,"duration":14.82},{"text":"And these trains were not part of the basic system.","start":262.548,"stop":266.201,"duration":3.65},{"text":"Consequently, notice was given of their discontinuance and on April 1, 1971 when the Act did become effective, those trains were discontinued.","start":266.201,"stop":274.518,"duration":8.32},{"text":"However, prior to that the respondent here brought a suit in the Federal District Court against Amtrak, the Central of Georgia and the Southern Railway seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the discontinuance of these three trains.","start":274.518,"stop":293.779,"duration":19.26},{"text":"It was alleged that the Act was violated because of the relationship between Central and Southern.","start":293.779,"stop":299.707,"duration":5.93},{"text":"Southern down and virtually all of the stock of Central.","start":299.707,"stop":302.612,"duration":2.91},{"text":"Southern itself had decided not to enter into contract with Amtrak.","start":302.612,"stop":307.486,"duration":4.87},{"text":"But the Central of Georgia had and they claimed north, the railroad association here claimed that either the entire railway system had to enter into a contract or no part of it could.","start":307.486,"stop":321.259,"duration":13.77},{"text":"No subsidiary could.","start":321.259,"stop":324.217,"duration":2.96},{"text":"And it sought a permanent injunction restraining the parties from enforcing any contract which did not include the entire Southern system.","start":324.217,"stop":332.271,"duration":8.05},{"text":"The District Court denied the temporary restraining order and dismissed the complaint on the theory that NARP had no standing because of Section 307 which provides that if Amtrak or any railroad violates the Act, the District Court shall have jurisdiction upon petition of the Attorney General of the United States or in the case involved in the labor agreement upon petition of any employee affected thereby including duly authorized employee representatives.","start":332.271,"stop":364.685,"duration":32.41},{"text":"And the District Courts were given jurisdiction to grant equitable release upon petition of those parties.","start":364.685,"stop":372.619,"duration":7.93},{"text":"Now it’s clear that the Court of Appeals reversed and held that there was standing.","start":372.619,"stop":378.158,"duration":5.54},{"text":"That's clear that Congress has the authority to limit the right to sue under an Act of this kind.","start":378.158,"stop":384.497,"duration":6.34},{"text":"This Court has so held in other cases.","start":384.497,"stop":387.521,"duration":3.02},{"text":"So the only question here really is whether Congress intended to do so.","start":387.521,"stop":392.431,"duration":4.91},{"text":"Did it intend to restrict the right to sue?","start":392.431,"stop":395.665,"duration":3.23},{"text":"We think very clearly it did.","start":395.665,"stop":398.144,"duration":2.48},{"text":"We just take the statutory language standing alone.","start":398.144,"stop":401.916,"duration":3.77},{"text":"We’ll note that it doesn’t provide specifically that anyone aggrieved or injured can sue.","start":401.916,"stop":408.174,"duration":6.26},{"text":"It does not even provide that the specified remedies in the statute are in addition to other remedies.","start":408.174,"stop":416.312,"duration":8.14},{"text":"It doesn’t even provide that the specified remedies didn’t extinguish any remedy or right of action not in consistent herewith which it has done in other statutes.","start":416.312,"stop":427.354,"duration":11.04},{"text":"And instead, specifically names the persons who are going to be able to petition the Court.","start":427.354,"stop":433.426,"duration":6.07},{"text":"In this case however, we do not have to rely upon the words of the statute alone because there are some very specific and direct legislative history that goes right to the point before the Court.","start":433.426,"stop":446.654,"duration":13.23},{"text":"In the original draft of the bill, the District Court was given jurisdiction to sue Amtrak, Amtrak alone -- given jurisdiction when there is a suit against Amtrak alone.","start":446.654,"stop":460.331,"duration":13.68},{"text":"Upon petition of the Attorney General or in the case involved in a labor agreement upon petition of any individual affected thereby.","start":460.331,"stop":468.648,"duration":8.32},{"text":"Now, you’ll note two things about that.","start":468.648,"stop":471.044,"duration":2.4},{"text":"First of all, Amtrak alone could be sued and secondly, it didn’t say anything about labor representatives just the employees.","start":471.044,"stop":477.475,"duration":6.43},{"text":"At the hearings which ensue labor representatives came along with ten proposed amendments to the Act.","start":477.475,"stop":485.918,"duration":8.44},{"text":"One of them would have specifically allowed any aggrieved party to bring a suit for violation of the Act.","start":485.918,"stop":493.433,"duration":7.51},{"text":"As labor spokesman said as the Bill now reads, only the Attorney General except in cases involving a labor agreement could bring actions.","start":493.433,"stop":504.372,"duration":10.94},{"text":"Now the Secretary of Transportation who had a good deal to do with this Act in including -- following up on various sections of it, thereupon wrote the committee a letter addressing himself to the various proposed amendments.","start":504.372,"stop":520.659,"duration":16.29},{"text":"And he said, I would oppose -- I would be opposed to permitting any person to seek enforcement of Section 307.","start":520.659,"stop":530.504,"duration":9.85},{"text":"Now thereupon what happen?","start":530.504,"stop":533.169,"duration":2.66},{"text":"This is important because this is not a case oPassengers. f legislative history where we have the committee ignoring people who have submitted views on the contrary.","start":533.169,"stop":542.534,"duration":9.37},{"text":"The committee actually did make specific changes in the bill.","start":542.534,"stop":547.205,"duration":4.67},{"text":"For example, according to following labor’s wish which the Secretary had no objection to; they added specifically that representatives of employees could sue as well as the employees themselves.","start":547.205,"stop":560.882,"duration":13.68},{"text":"Again, following labor’s wish and the secretary thought it was unnecessary but it didn’t oppose it.","start":560.882,"stop":567.583,"duration":6.7},{"text":"They introduced the allowing other railroads to be sued as well as Amtrak.","start":567.583,"stop":572.817,"duration":5.23},{"text":"In other words, not just Amtrak alone but other railroads could also be sued under the Act.","start":572.817,"stop":578.11,"duration":5.29},{"text":"But because of the Secretary’s objection, the committee specifically refused to introduce this concept of permitting all aggrieved persons to sue.","start":578.11,"stop":590.895,"duration":12.78},{"text":"The Secretary had objected to it and the committee left it out and the Bill was passed without it.","start":590.895,"stop":596.967,"duration":6.07},{"text":"It seems perfectly clear to us from this that Congress intended only those parties that were designated in the Bill in the statute to be able to sue.","start":596.967,"stop":606.302,"duration":9.34},{"text":"This case therefore becomes like Switchmen’s Union and Montana-Dakota Utilities and Fleischmann Distilling, and Calhoon versus Harvey and so forth.","start":606.302,"stop":616.033,"duration":9.73},{"text":"The cases where the specific remedies which were mentioned excluded others including suits by aggrieved parties.","start":616.033,"stop":626.296,"duration":10.26},{"text":"In addition however, there are very important policy reasons why Congress left out aggrieved parties and why this Court should not sanction it.","start":626.296,"stop":637.344,"duration":11.05},{"text":"The Secretary of Transportation, the ICC and Amtrak, all were given very unusual authority and responsibility to fashion a workable passenger transportation system in this Act.","start":637.344,"stop":649.299,"duration":11.95},{"text":"For example, this Amtrak is supposed to make a profit eventually even though it was recognized that these various railroads were losing millions on their passenger traffic.","start":649.299,"stop":658.281,"duration":8.98},{"text":"So it is a very complex and difficult job that was fashioned here.","start":658.281,"stop":662.533,"duration":4.25},{"text":"And if anybody can sue the railroad, certain things are clearly going to happen.","start":662.533,"stop":667.497,"duration":4.96},{"text":"For example, even if there’s a single suit in regard to the discontinuance of an important line, you are going to have delays if temporary restraining orders are entered which as our brief shows could cost literally millions to Amtrak.","start":667.497,"stop":683.335,"duration":15.84},{"text":"But even more importantly, if more than one person sues, if suits are brought in regard to a single discontinuance in Alabama and then Georgia, etcetera, you’re going to have the possibility of not only the temporary delays of one case but you’re going to have possibilities of conflict between circuits which are going to unduly delay the discontinuances that are clearly called for by the Act.","start":683.335,"stop":711.396,"duration":28.06},{"text":"This case therefore becomes similar to Halloway versus Brist-Myers which is cited to the Court in our reply brief which interestingly was decided by -- also by the D.C. Circuit but by a completely different panel from the panel that decided the instant case.","start":711.396,"stop":728.529,"duration":17.13},{"text":"And they decided that the private party even though aggrieved does not have a right to sue under the Federal Trade Commission Act.","start":728.529,"stop":734.661,"duration":6.13},{"text":"And the Court specifically pointed out the vexatious litigation that could ensue.","start":734.661,"stop":742.05,"duration":7.39},{"text":"It pointed out to private parties may institute piecemeal lawsuits reflecting disparate concerns and not a coordinated enforcement program.","start":742.05,"stop":752.35,"duration":10.3},{"text":"That same principle is precisely applicable here.","start":752.35,"stop":755.578,"duration":3.23}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"You filed it with reply brief, Mr. Prettyman?","start":755.578,"stop":758.356,"duration":2.78}]},{"speakerName":"E.
