admission to the law school.","start":77.053,"stop":89.903,"duration":12.85},{"text":"Now, we do not contend that mathematical grades alone were the sole admission criteria employed by the law school, but the record is clear that, taking all criteria in account, in the law school’s own judgment its minority program resulted into the admission of minority students less qualified than non-minority students who were rejected particularly because there appears to be some misconception of the facts by many of the amici briefs, and possibly also the respondents.","start":89.903,"stop":125.766,"duration":35.86},{"text":"I’d like to discuss a little bit of the background and the factual situation with reference to Marco

wrong.","start":141.195,"stop":149.125,"duration":7.93},{"text":"Marco attended grade school and high school in Seattle, was graduated from the University of Washington as an honor student in 1970.","start":149.125,"stop":160.127,"duration":11},{"text":"He received Phi Beta Capa, Magna Cum Laude, and notwithstanding the fact that he had worked 20-40 hours a week all the time that he was in

consider.","start":176.432,"stop":199.302,"duration":22.87},{"text":"In 1971, after he had been rejected by the law school and advised that if he tried again the following year there might be room for him, he went to graduate school at the same University of Washington.","start":199.302,"stop":213.216,"duration":13.91},{"text":"He took 24 hours of graduate work, again working 30-40 hours a week

Junior-Senior grade point averages and the LSAT scores were combined, using a formula to arrive to what was referred to as a predicted first year average, which in DeFunis’ case, was 76.23.","start":261.741,"stop":278.971,"duration":17.23},{"text":"He had little money, and his wife worked as a dental assistant to help him through school and he was also helped by his

Committee?","start":328.337,"stop":337.057,"duration":8.72},{"text":"The only answer we could get was that there were other students better qualified than DeFunis.","start":337.057,"stop":343.137,"duration":6.08},{"text":"We told him we couldn’t accept that.","start":343.137,"stop":345.117,"duration":1.98},{"text":"We had to see something to verify that fact.","start":345.117,"stop":349.013,"duration":3.9},{"text":"The records were confidential.","start":349.013,"stop":350.565,"duration":1.55},{"text":"Even though we said we weren’t interested in

matters.”","start":359.193,"stop":361.277,"duration":2.08},{"text":"We next appeared and met with the Board of Regents, took his parents with us, I don’t think we took the boy.","start":361.277,"stop":369.447,"duration":8.17},{"text":"Again, Board of Regents listened and said they would let us know, advised us that “no,” they were going to stand by the decision made by the Dean of the law School and the Admissions Committee, and that there was no room for Marco DeFunis.","start":369.447,"stop":386.354,"duration":16.91},{"text":"We had no any alternative after he’d been denied twice, but to bring a lawsuit, and it was only after litigation was started and during pretrial discovery in the taking of depositions and in fact only during the trial itself that we’re able to get a Court order requiring the university to produce the files and the records of some of those who were being admitted, and we had to look at them during the noon hour because the trial was in process and the Court ordered them to be brought down to the Courtroom, but not all 1,500 or 1,600.","start":386.354,"stop":422.919,"duration":36.57},{"text":"We settled for about 300 or 400 and during the noon hour, we went through those records.","start":422.919,"stop":428.897,"duration":5.98},{"text":"And, the record here will show you what we found when we went through them and we put them in evidence is who they were taking into the school.","start":428.897,"stop":439.307,"duration":10.41},{"text":"Now, what the university admissions class really did, they admitted two classes, not one.","start":439.307,"stop":450.281,"duration":10.97},{"text":"They took the non-minority group and they looked at their grades, and we’re not saying they looked only at their grades but what else was there to look at?","start":450.281,"stop":460.228,"duration":9.95},{"text":"There were no personal interviews.","start":460.228,"stop":462.67,"duration":2.44},{"text":"They looked at their grades, and the file they had the grades, honors, recommendations, everybody had a recommendation that they produced, the application of the student, and that’s about all.","start":462.67,"stop":475.272,"duration":12.6},{"text":"And, they determined, the Chairman of the Committee, that anybody who had a predicted first year average of 77 would automatically be admitted with a few exceptions, most of those came in later, and they actually admitted those too.","start":475.272,"stop":489.495,"duration":14.22},{"text":"So, everyone who had a 77 or higher are automatically admitted.","start":489.495,"stop":494.537,"duration":5.04},{"text":"Then, they took the next list and anyone that were 75 -- 74.5, they were automatically eliminated with the exception
