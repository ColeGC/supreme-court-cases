Appeals for the Second Circuit to review its decision dismissing the action as a class action.","start":54.482,"stop":67.088,"duration":12.61},{"text":"The grant of certiorari requested the parties to brief and to argue in addition to the questions presented, a question of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.","start":67.088,"stop":77.442,"duration":10.35},{"text":"The other questions, include the manageability of the large class action, who must be given notice, who should pay for the notice and the scope of discretion of the District Court.","start":77.442,"stop":90.297,"duration":12.86},{"text":"Turning first to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, jurisdiction was asserted on two grounds.","start":90.297,"stop":97.458,"duration":7.16},{"text":"First of all, the Court in 1968 in reversing the District Court said that it retained jurisdiction and secondly, the defendants say that it has jurisdiction anyway under the Collateral Order Doctrine.","start":97.458,"stop":113.707,"duration":16.25},{"text":"Originally, jurisdiction was assumed in the Court of Appeals under what became known as the “\"death knell\"” doctrine when the class action in the first instance was dismissed by Judge Tyler in the District Court, and on the plaintiff’s appeal, the Court of Appeals held that to dismiss the class action would in effect bring it to an end, and the class would never get any chance of review.","start":113.707,"stop":137.444,"duration":23.74},{"text":"Now, if the \"death knell\" doctrine was incorrectly decided, later when the case was decided on the merits by the Court of Appeals in what became known as Eisen II, when it said “We retain jurisdiction,” it would obviously have had no jurisdiction to retain, and the defendants concede that.","start":137.444,"stop":157.493,"duration":20.05},{"text":"We however, adhere to our view originally expressed in our position to their petition for certiorari before this Court and the \"death knell\" doctrine came up for review, and that petition was denied, that it was soundly decided by the Second Circuit.","start":157.493,"stop":174.859,"duration":17.37},{"text":"Now it has been considerably eroded since then.","start":174.859,"stop":177.74,"duration":2.88},{"text":"For example, the Third Circuit in Hackett against General Host Corporation, rejected it entirely.","start":177.74,"stop":185.41,"duration":7.67},{"text":"But what happened in Hackett I think shows how wise the Second Circuit was in adopting the \"death knell\" doctrine because after Hackett refused to hear the appeal in that consumer antitrust case brought by a and on behalf of purchasers of bread following a conviction for price fixing in the Philadelphia area.","start":185.41,"stop":206.026,"duration":20.62},{"text":"The case was dropped by the plaintiff, because it couldn’t proceed without having a class action to support it and consequently, the question of the class never got to be reviewed.","start":206.026,"stop":220.851,"duration":14.82},{"text":"Our submission is different.","start":220.851,"stop":223.032,"duration":2.18},{"text":"We submit that while the Court of Appeals said in reversing the District Court, when the District Court dismissed the class action, that it retained jurisdiction, what it actually did was to relinquish jurisdiction because it reversed.","start":223.032,"stop":240.331,"duration":17.3},{"text":"And this is unlike cases where Court of Appeals may remand the record for further findings because the record before it is insufficient to enable it to render a decision and meanwhile, no decision is rendered.","start":240.331,"stop":253.509,"duration":13.18},{"text":"Here, a decision was rendered so that the court said it retained jurisdiction, but it really didn’t.","start":253.509,"stop":260.164,"duration":6.66},{"text":"In fact, the defendants were so confused about their role that when they came up before the Court of Appeals for the final time, this time trying to reverse the District Court, because the District Court had sustained the class action in every respect, they didn’t know who they were, and they designated themselves as appellees even though they have lost.","start":260.164,"stop":283.384,"duration":23.22},{"text":"So there is a complete paradox and anomaly, and the Court of Appeals having rendered this decision saying in fact that it retained it.","start":283.384,"stop":291.974,"duration":8.59},{"text":"Turning to the collateral order doctrine under Cohen, that has no application for a number of reasons.","start":291.974,"stop":300.221,"duration":8.25},{"text":"First of all, the class action determination is, in the language of Cohen, but a step toward the final judgment in which it will merge.","start":300.221,"stop":309.363,"duration":9.14},{"text":"Rule 23 (c) prescribes that judgment will be entered for/or against the class, as the Court recently noted in its opinion in American Pipe against the State of Utah.","start":309.363,"stop":320.436,"duration":11.07},{"text":"And it is a step which has to be taken in every class action, because under Rule 23 (c) 1, the court is
