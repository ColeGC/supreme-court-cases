Bicron.","start":520.301,"stop":551.64,"duration":31.34},{"text":"There can be no question on this record, but what these individual defendants appropriated to the benefit of Bicron, Harshaw’s

States.","start":566.183,"stop":582.433,"duration":16.25},{"text":"That is that the law of trade secrets is preempted by the patent laws, and on this basis the Court of Appeals reversed the order of the District Court which had entered an injunction against respondents, and that is the issue which he has -- been brought here.","start":582.433,"stop":604.303,"duration":21.87},{"text":"Now, there is nothing unusual about the Ohio Law relating to trade secrets.","start":604.303,"stop":609.773,"duration":5.47},{"text":"It’s similar to the law which has been long effect in most of the States and which is derived from English sources going back over a century.","start":609.773,"stop":621.124,"duration":11.35},{"text":"It is indeed simply an application of the traditional equity principle, where dealing with threatened breach of contract, or violations of fiduciary obligation.","start":621.124,"stop":635.74,"duration":14.62},{"text":"Obviously, the value of a trade secret depends upon as being kept secret.","start":635.74,"stop":641.944,"duration":6.2},{"text":"This does not mean that it cannot be disclosed in confidence or with suitable safeguards as a means of utilizing the secret.","start":641.944,"stop":650.133,"duration":8.19},{"text":"But unless the safeguards can be enforced, that is the safeguards arising out of contract or out of fiduciary relationship.","start":650.133,"stop":659.849,"duration":9.72},{"text":"The secret will soon no longer be a secret and accordingly will have no value.","start":659.849,"stop":668.247,"duration":8.4},{"text":"A trade secret is not the equivalent of a patent.","start":668.247,"stop":673.665,"duration":5.42},{"text":"A patent when valid, gives a right reaching to the boundaries of the United States, effective against every person in the United States.","start":673.665,"stop":684.868,"duration":11.2},{"text":"It is a true governmental grant of a monopoly.","start":684.868,"stop":689.724,"duration":4.86},{"text":"When a patent is granted, there is disclosure to the public, but no one may utilize the device of process without license for a period of 17 years.","start":689.724,"stop":702.828,"duration":13.1},{"text":"This is true even as to a person who has independently dis -- conceived the same idea.","start":702.828,"stop":710.937,"duration":8.11},{"text":"It’s true as to everyone within the outer limits of the United States.","start":710.937,"stop":715.862,"duration":4.92},{"text":"It’s a true monopoly.","start":715.862,"stop":719.467,"duration":3.61},{"text":"But a trade secret is much more limited.","start":719.467,"stop":723.439,"duration":3.97},{"text":"It finds its substance as I have indicated in ordinary principles of equity.","start":723.439,"stop":729.468,"duration":6.03},{"text":"It’s enforced against persons only who have one way or another, undertaken an obligation not to disclose.","start":729.468,"stop":739.55,"duration":10.08},{"text":"It may be enforced too against persons who obtain the secret wrongfully as by bribery or by burglary, as to all the world though, other than those who are bound by contract or by fiduciary duty, the trade secret maybe utilized by anyone who obtains it without wrongdoing.","start":739.55,"stop":763.114,"duration":23.56},{"text":"Thus, it maybe uncovered by inspection by what is called reverse engineering.","start":763.114,"stop":770.969,"duration":7.86},{"text":"You take the thing that you have and a trained engineer works back to see how it was put together or by trial and error.","start":770.969,"stop":780.744,"duration":9.77},{"text":"It may also be developed by anyone who carries on the same steps of research and development which were utilized by the original developer of the trade secret.","start":780.744,"stop":793.525,"duration":12.78},{"text":"In this particular case, the record shows that there are a number of competitors who are in no way bound by contract or by fiduciary obligation, and all of them are free to develop the same trade secrets if they can.","start":793.525,"stop":809.234,"duration":15.71},{"text":"Now, this would not be true with respect to a patent which binds all others no matter how independent or original their activities may be.","start":809.234,"stop":822.891,"duration":13.66},{"text":"Now, the issue here is whether the state law of trade secrets long in effect and prevalent throughout the United States, has in some way been preempted by the patent laws.","start":822.891,"stop":836.564,"duration":13.67},{"text":"It’s true of course that Congress has been given power to grant patents.","start":836.564,"stop":845.107,"duration":8.54},{"text":"Historically the States granted patents in the early days, but I don’t believe they do now.","start":845.107,"stop":852.042,"duration":6.94},{"text":"It may well be true that Congress could under the necessary and proper law -- clause preempt the state law of trade secrets.","start":852.042,"stop":862,"duration":9.96},{"text":"Just as I suppose if Congress could preempt the copyright field, so as to invalidate all state legislation in that
