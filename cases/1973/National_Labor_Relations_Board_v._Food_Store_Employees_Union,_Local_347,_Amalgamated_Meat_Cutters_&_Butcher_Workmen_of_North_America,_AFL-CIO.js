Court.","start":12.864,"stop":22.665,"duration":9.8},{"text":"The Labor Board contends that the Court of Appeals usurped the Board’s function of determining in the first instance what remedies were necessary to effectuate the Act, the policies of the Act and that they thereby infringed upon on the board’s prerogative.","start":22.665,"stop":40.095,"duration":17.43},{"text":"We say no.","start":40.095,"stop":41.95,"duration":1.86},{"text":"We say that the Court did not reach the question in this case as to whether that the withholding of remedies frustrated rather than effectuated the policies of the Act.","start":41.95,"stop":51.546,"duration":9.6},{"text":"What it did was merely to hold that the Board’s rationale for denying organizational expenses and counsel fees in the Heck’s case could not reasonably really reconcile with the Board’s supplemental decision in Tiidee and with the purported distinction of Heck’s in that Tiide opinion.","start":51.546,"stop":71.384,"duration":19.84},{"text":"If the Court below was correct in its analysis of those opinions then the Court was entitled we believe, to reverse the Board for its error of law, namely its arbitrator departure from its own rule.","start":71.384,"stop":85.704,"duration":14.32},{"text":"Unless the Court of Appeals is not empowered to require the Board to follow the principles the board says it follows, then the court below should be sustained.","start":85.704,"stop":95.576,"duration":9.87},{"text":"If a divergence arises between Courts of Appeals on the question whether at any given set of circumstances the board is in fact following its own presets.","start":95.576,"stop":105.347,"duration":9.77},{"text":"That difference as all the cases of conflict are for this Court to resolve ultimately.","start":105.347,"stop":112.056,"duration":6.71},{"text":"To show that the Court of Appeals was merely holding the Board to its own guidelines, I quoted from the supplemental decision in Tiidee at page 33, that portion which indicates that the Board recognized that the award of counsel fees and organizational expenses, among other measures was both within its powers and if necessary to and I quote the Board, “Undo some of the baneful effects pointed out the by the Court of Appeals in Tiidee.”","start":112.056,"stop":141.623,"duration":29.57},{"text":"And what were the baneful effects pointed out by the Court of Appeals in Tiidee?","start":141.623,"stop":146.239,"duration":4.62},{"text":"There, the Court of Appeals had explained that in refusal to bargain cases, to award merely the board’s normal remedies operated counter-productively to effectuating the policies of the Act in as much as they enabled the wrong doer to retain the fruits of his wrong doings and left uncompensated and un-remedied the injuries, which the employers’ wrongful conduct had imposed upon the Union and its employee beneficiaries.","start":146.239,"stop":174.847,"duration":28.61},{"text":"Both of those are the essential elements that are in order -- proper to effectuate the policies of the Act must contain as this Court has held.","start":174.847,"stop":184.47,"duration":9.62},{"text":"Now, in the Tiidee opinion, the Board explained that it had the power to enter these remedies.","start":184.47,"stop":192.083,"duration":7.61},{"text":"It assumed that it had the power to enter these remedies and assumed that and said that beyond this, we don’t think we can go.","start":192.083,"stop":199.903,"duration":7.82},{"text":"We can’t go to make whole remedy, but we could do this and then at page 35 of the appendix, a portion that was quoted by the Court of Appeals in its opinion, the board explained that it was denying organizational expenses in Tiidee because and I quote, “We find no nexus between the employer’s unlawful conduct here under examination and the Union’s pre-election organizational expenses and accordingly we shall not award them to the Union.”","start":199.903,"stop":231.471,"duration":31.57},{"text":"Given the portion of the supplemental opinion that I quoted yesterday, at page 33, the court below was entire -- entirely entitled we believe, to treat this explanation as to the reason organizational expenses were not being accorded in Tiidee.","start":231.471,"stop":252.799,"duration":21.33},{"text":"As a tacit admission, that if they had been -- if there ever had been such an excess, the Board would've ordered reimbursement of the excess organizing expenses.","start":252.799,"stop":263.095,"duration":10.3},{"text":"Now, in Heck’s, the Board conceded the nexus between the employer’s unfair labor practice and the excess organizational expenses.","start":263.095,"stop":270.59,"duration":7.49},{"text":"It noted that as Mr. Friedman said yesterday, probably these things had occurred.","start":270.59,"stop":275.81,"duration":5.22},{"text":"The only reason the Board gave for denying recovery was that the charging party's allegedly subordinate role in unfair labor practice litigation made it inappropriate.","start":275.81,"stop":286.181,"duration":10.37},{"text":"But that factor is simply irrelevant to whether the employers should be required to reimburse a union -- a victim, the Union, and its members or supporters for excess organizing expenses resulting from the employer’s unfair labor practices.","start":286.181,"stop":303.317,"duration":17.14},{"text":"Those excess costs are borne by all of the employee supporters of the Union as such.","start":303.317,"stop":309.61,"duration":6.29},{"text":"They are the victims of the employer's unfair labor practice, so they must be made whole if possible.","start":309.61,"stop":316.177,"duration":6.57},{"text":"Otherwise, they suffer an injury which is uncompensated and the employees in the bargaining unit are further injured not merely by having to have ultimately their dues and their assessments increased but by the fact that these are organizing expenses which the Union would otherwise have been able to use for negotiators and for experts in producing a better collective bargaining contract.","start":316.177,"stop":342.501,"duration":26.32},{"text":"Now, if the Board charging party's role were relevant to the question of whether excess organizational fees should be reimbursed, then the Board could not award, make an award of excess organizational expenses to a Union in any case because the Union’s role in all cases, is according to the Board subordinate.","start":342.501,"stop":367.247,"duration":24.75},{"text":"But that’s not the reasoning that the Board purported to follow in its Tiidee opinion.","start":367.247,"stop":371.789,"duration":4.54},{"text":"It purported to say, we know that organizational expenses, excess organizational expenses should fairly be reimbursed.","start":371.789,"stop":379.342,"duration":7.55},{"text":"We’re not going to do it here because there is no nexus, the Union suffered no nexus, no loss as the result of the employer’s activities.","start":379.342,"stop":387.214,"duration":7.87},{"text":"Since the Board found there was a nexus in the Heck’s case then its explanation doesn’t wash and its denial of these is arbitrary and capricious and illegal.","start":387.214,"stop":399.03,"duration":11.82},{"text":"As to the legal fees, the only reasons that the Board offered for denying recovery in this case, are the allegedly subordinate role of the charging party and the assumed common law rule.","start":399.03,"stop":410.949,"duration":11.92},{"text":"By awarding counsel fees in Tiidee, to both the Union and the Board counsel, the Board demonstrated that its conception of the role of the charging party to the issue was absolutely irrelevant.","start":410.949,"stop":424.64,"duration":13.69},{"text":"If the board’s -- if the charging party’s role is subordinate and the general counsel’s role is superior then as the Court perceived in Tiidee, the way to take care of the problem is to award counsel fees against the employer of both for having unnecessarily forced the burden of litigation on both.","start":424.64,"stop":445.223,"duration":20.58},{"text":"And consequent, as a result of that, the Board can no longer in this case rely upon that reasoning to sustain its denial of litigation expenses in the Heck’s case.","start":445.223,"stop":460.241,"duration":15.02},{"text":"Now, the Board’s conception nevertheless, treating it as a matter raised in Tiidee, the Board’s conception of the role of the charging party in an unfair labor practice litigation simply does not swear with this Court’s view of the matter as expressed in Scofield .","start":460.241,"stop":478.016,"duration":17.78},{"text":"In Scofield , the Board recognized that the statute itself carries with it the germ of protection of private interests and it also recognizes that when the charging party at \"X\" effectively to protect those private interests, it is necessarily also effectuating the public interest in enforcement of public rights which the statute establishes.","start":478.016,"stop":506.159,"duration":28.14},{"text":"Now, if that is so and we submit that can't denied, if that is so, then the charging party’s counsel in a Labor Board proceeding, acts as private Attorney General in the same vital sense that others do in statutes which this Court has held to imply private rights of actions where the burnt of the litigation is borne by the private party.","start":506.159,"stop":537.976,"duration":31.82},{"text":"But with the blessings of the Government agency and usually with the support of the Government's -- Government agency when a case comes to this Court for the private counsel seeking fees, and I speak particularly of cases like Mills versus Auto-Lite.","start":537.976,"stop":552.702,"duration":14.73},{"text":"The Board did not see this.","start":552.702,"stop":555.012,"duration":2.31},{"text":"It took a dog in the manger view here unlike the attitude that most administrative agencies take when private parties are acting, surely, perhaps exclusively in a wrong private interest, but in fact in a manner which benefits the public interest inescapably.","start":555.012,"stop":574.142,"duration":19.13},{"text":"The Court should welcome and not reject their support.","start":574.142,"stop":579.181,"duration":5.04},{"text":"The Court should reward their success and make the litigation of these matters a concern of capable private counsel.","start":579.181,"stop":589.753,"duration":10.57},{"text":"And a way to do that is of course, as this Court has said to award attorney’s fees, particularly to them.","start":589.753,"stop":596.671,"duration":6.92}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

is in addition to the normal cease and desist order in the posting of notices here in order to aid the Union, the Board required that the employer send the notices out to each employee at his home,

the Union would be able to make contact more easily with the employees.","start":1016.041,"stop":1055.831,"duration":39.79},{"text":"And then it went on to say that those remedies would, given it did not feel as a general rule, it should give the additional remedy of organizational expenses and counsel fees because in the light of the nature of the charging party’s limited role, this case was not

Act.","start":1055.831,"stop":1084.091,"duration":28.26},{"text":"Now the Board did refer to the American rule, the general rule that ordinarily in the absence of statute or contract, attorney’s fees

decision.","start":1084.091,"stop":1102.347,"duration":18.26},{"text":"The touchstone of the Board’s decision is set forth on page 38 (a) was that it was not necessary to effectuate the policies of the Act, the statutory standard for determining remedies.","start":1102.347,"stop":1114.273,"duration":11.93},{"text":"It was not necessary to effectuate the policies of the Act to give this

of a multiple recidivist whose brazen violations in the Board’s own words are company wide aggravated and pervasive.","start":2111.37,"stop":2125.705,"duration":14.34},{"text":"The Board found that Heck’s had a policy, a labor policy which was opposed to policies of the Act, and as a result of that policy, within a relatively short time, between 1965 and 1970, Heck’s was involved in unfair practice litigation 11 times.","start":2125.705,"stop":2143.704,"duration":18},{"text":"During that period as it happened, the Court of Appeals for Fourth Circuit was holding that the Board couldn’t

reversed the trial examiner's determination that there was no refusal to bargain in bad faith was not because it differed with him on the facts, but on it -- because its view that Heck’s was totally unconcerned with whether the Union had a majority or not.","start":2176.146,"stop":2197.973,"duration":21.83},{"text":"It wouldn’t have bargained no matter what the situation was because of its

that Heck’s used was to transfer, discharge or close its door or threaten to do those things if the Union got in to engage in excessive interrogation, coercive interviews and illegal polls.","start":2217.513,"stop":2236.849,"duration":19.34},{"text":"When the Union requested recognition, Heck’s would step up its

that, the only way to see that is to see that the employer is willing to submit to litigation even though he has gotten a plausible defense or no matter how brazen his violations are in the hope like Mr. McCoben that something will turn up.","start":2276.341,"stop":2290.812,"duration":14.47},{"text":"And if he is able to attack the Union’s card showing, well, that’s let him free of the hook

illegally.","start":2290.812,"stop":2303.808,"duration":13},{"text":"All of his illegal action was devoted to destroying the support for the Union whether or not they have a

say, and oh yes before I get to that I should mention that when Mr. Friedman says that the Board’s decision -- the Court’s decision in Tiidee related only to frivolous litigation.","start":2346.99,"stop":2374.589,"duration":27.6},{"text":"He omits the fact that the remand in the Heck’s itself was predicated not on the frivolity of the defense, but on the persistent

was -- could properly have believed that all the Court of Appeals meant was it should award counsel fees in cases of frivolous litigation and not where they’re aggravated and persistent violations as where in Heck’s.","start":2386.541,"stop":2403.192,"duration":16.65},{"text":"That distinction just simply blown out on the basis of the Heck’s remand

case.","start":2408.194,"stop":2416.553,"duration":8.36},{"text":"As we understand it that means that they were content to attempt to follow what the Board -- what the Court had told them to do and one of the things that the Court had told them it had to do was to consider at least some of the alternative remedies, including organization expense -- excess organizational expenses and counsel fees that had been requested by other parties including the Union in the Heck’s case as alternative to the so called make-all remedy.","start":2416.553,"stop":2442.887,"duration":26.33},{"text":"On page 33
