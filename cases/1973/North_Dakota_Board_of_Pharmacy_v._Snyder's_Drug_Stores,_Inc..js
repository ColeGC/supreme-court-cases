reversed.","start":292.529,"stop":304.899,"duration":12.37},{"text":"Now, there has been a large change in the philosophy of the Supreme Court in regard to what legal writers have referred to as Economic Due Process since the Liggett versus Baldridge decision.","start":304.899,"stop":316.435,"duration":11.54},{"text":"In our briefs, we traced this history citing the Lochner, Adkins and

that the doctrine that prevailed in Coppage, Adkins and Lochner cases has been abandoned by this Court.","start":336.381,"stop":347.555,"duration":11.17},{"text":"This Court has stated we emphatically refused to go back to the time when we used the Due Process Clause to strike down state laws, regulatory or business in economic affairs because we feel they are unwise and prudent or out of harmony with some particular school of thought.","start":347.555,"stop":362.933,"duration":15.38},{"text":"The Court has stated we do not set as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom need reasonable on us or

government.","start":362.933,"stop":383.582,"duration":20.65},{"text":"Now, in the Daniel versus Family Security Life case, specific reference was made to the Liggett case and has said that the rational followed in that case did not find expression in the Liggett versus Baldridge decision and that there has been a pronounced shift of emphasis since the Liggett versus Baldridge decision.","start":383.582,"stop":400.493,"duration":16.91},{"text":"Also, I have stated various State Court decisions that have said that Collins and Liggett have been seriously limited if not completely undermined.","start":400.493,"stop":410.481,"duration":9.99},{"text":"Now based on these decisions, we feel there is an extreme presumption of constitutionality and validity of state legislation in this particular area that if the North Dakota legislature determined that there was an evil present and this was a rational way to prevent this evil or to correct the exposure to this evil that this is efficient to sustain the constitutionality and validity of the statute that if any set of facts can reasonably justify the statute, we feel that is efficient.","start":410.481,"stop":444.239,"duration":33.76},{"text":"Now, the respondent, in their brief that raised also the Equal Protection Clause and amicus brief for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores devoted more time to this.","start":444.239,"stop":456.925,"duration":12.69},{"text":"I think this basically is governed by the same standard of review as the Due Process Clause that only invidious discrimination is prohibited and the states have wide latitude in this regard.","start":456.925,"stop":471.614,"duration":14.69},{"text":"I think it’s got the same standard as the Due Process Clause and in effect, it should be also left after the states in their own wisdom and judgment as far as the a passage of such legislation.","start":471.614,"stop":482.987,"duration":11.37},{"text":"Now, the amicus of National Association of Chain Drug Stores also raised the Commerce Clause issue and this was raised for the first time on appeal and I don’t think it’s properly raised or should be under consideration here when it is raised for the first time on appeal.","start":482.987,"stop":499.599,"duration":16.61},{"text":"However, the case as I cite had to do mainly with the State’s attempt to protect local industry at the exclusion of national industry or some outside national commerce depot and that the case as they say such as Dean versus City of Madison where case is where the state attempted to protect the local industry such as requiring that milk process within five miles.","start":499.599,"stop":524.801,"duration":25.2},{"text":"It had to be a process within five miles in the City of Madison.","start":524.801,"stop":527.991,"duration":3.19},{"text":"And this particular statute applies at what we have in this case equally to local corporations, local chain stores -- we have local

to.","start":527.991,"stop":545.758,"duration":17.77},{"text":"Also, we do not feel that this statute has anything to do with interstate commerce.","start":545.758,"stop":551.218,"duration":5.46},{"text":"I think it’s safe to say that there are no prescription drugs manufactured in the State of North Dakota.","start":551.218,"stop":557.033,"duration":5.82},{"text":"And I think, I can also say that all prescription drugs that are properly approved by the Federal Government are available in North

doctors.","start":565.279,"stop":570.246,"duration":4.97},{"text":"And if for example, we led a hundred more chain stores or a hundred more stores opened in the state, theoretically, there will be no greater sale of prescription drugs because they are limited to prescriptions and I think they would have to point out that there are -- it’s the demand for prescription drugs which are not being
