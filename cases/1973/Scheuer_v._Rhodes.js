action against an individual, an individual who -- or here individuals, who are governmental officers, which doesn’t seek in any way to get at the state treasury or at public property, is an action which falls under the Eleventh Amendment.","start":246.291,"stop":265.031,"duration":18.74},{"text":"Therefore, I didn’t feel it was necessary to reach out for what you refer to in your opinion about it.","start":265.031,"stop":274.461,"duration":9.43},{"text":"The Missouri case, which is the most recent decision of the Court on point, it seems to me, pins down quite clearly that there has been no

opinion of Justice Douglas makes it quite clear that if the Congress, under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, were to attempt to lodge jurisdiction even against the state, if it were acting validly within a grant of legislative power, could do so.","start":293.849,"stop":315.963,"duration":22.11},{"text":"Justice Marshall’s opinion for -- himself and Justice Stewart specifically exempts

III.","start":315.963,"stop":333.661,"duration":17.7},{"text":"So that, it’s quite clear to me that what the Court of Appeals and what the District Court did was simply express its hostility to the plaintiffs’ view of the case by going out on a grant of decision which is totally unsupported by precedents of this Court, excuse me.","start":333.661,"stop":352.719,"duration":19.06},{"text":"So, we get to what I believe is the heart of the case and that is the question of whether or not an executive immunity, so-called or sometimes called a governmental or official immunity, attaches in suits arising under Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, specifically whether or not a governmental official can say “I’m immune from suit” and, therefore, though the plaintiff has charged him specifically with a deprivation of a constitutionally protected right, nevertheless, because of one’s position, one may not be sued.","start":352.719,"stop":390.008,"duration":37.29},{"text":"The precise issue has not been adjudicated before in this Court.","start":390.008,"stop":394.058,"duration":4.05},{"text":"We have Barr versus Matteo which is a defamation case arising under the District

summarized in our brief, does not really cover the ground here.","start":411.156,"stop":417.259,"duration":6.1},{"text":"We don’t have a libel action here.","start":417.259,"stop":420.078,"duration":2.82},{"text":"I express some doubt as to whether or not the same result would be reached in Barr versus Matteo on the basis of the law of defamation as it now stands after the Court’s opinions leading up to Rosenbloom, but I think it’s pretty clear that Barr versus Matteo does not cover this case.","start":420.078,"stop":436.223,"duration":16.15},{"text":"The only expression of judicial opinion in this Court of significance on the immunity question here is Justice Harlan’s concurring opinion in the Bevins case.","start":436.223,"stop":450.756,"duration":14.53},{"text":"If you may remember, the Bevins case presented both the question of whether or not there was a cause of action arising under the Fourth Amendment and, likewise, the question of whether or not defendants were immune from suit assuming there was a cause of action.","start":450.756,"stop":465.933,"duration":15.18},{"text":"Justice Brennan’s opinion for the majority did not reach that second question because the Court of Appeals had not reached it.","start":465.933,"stop":473.158,"duration":7.23},{"text":"Justice Harlan noted at the end of his long concurring opinion that it was not appropriate or necessary for him to decide the question, but he believed that it was appropriate to venture the opinion that, for the most flagrant examples of governmental abuse of power, there would certainly be a right to redress.","start":473.158,"stop":494.293,"duration":21.13},{"text":"That is essentially the basis of the claim asserted by these -- by the plaintiffs of this case.","start":494.293,"stop":502.157,"duration":7.86},{"text":"The issue has been spoken to by many Courts of Appeals.","start":502.157,"stop":509.991,"duration":7.83},{"text":"By and large, the Courts of Appeals have distinguished actions arising under the Civil Rights Act from state tort actions have noted, as did Justice Harlan, that a deprivation of a constitutional right is significantly more serious than a tort arising under state law.","start":509.991,"stop":531.942,"duration":21.95},{"text":"For that reason, they concluded that, irrespective of the state rule of immunity which might be applicable, it was clear to those courts that there was no such executive immunity under the Civil Rights Act.","start":531.942,"stop":547.357,"duration":15.41},{"text":"This conclusion, it seems to me, is the appropriate one.","start":547.357,"stop":550.128,"duration":2.77},{"text":"It certainly fits the intention of the Congress.","start":550.128,"stop":554.734,"duration":4.61},{"text":"The Congress of 1871 perceived the problem before as essentially a problem of violence and saw the problem that was sought to be raised by both Sections 1 and Sections 2 of that Act as governmental and non-governmental violence.","start":554.734,"stop":573.753,"duration":19.02},{"text":"The non-governmental violence being essentially covered by Section 2 of the Act which is presently Section 1985, and the governmental violence being covered primarily by Section 1 of the Act, that is, this is an appropriate case fitting within the precise legislative intention of the Congress.","start":573.753,"stop":598.093,"duration":24.34},{"text":"The Congress’ intention was recently summarized for the Court in Justice Brennan’s opinion in District of Columbia versus Carter.","start":598.093,"stop":606.224,"duration":8.13},{"text":"It certainly supports that conclusion that that is what Congress is concerned

logic.","start":828.756,"stop":858.362,"duration":29.61},{"text":"There is, for example, in the remand opinion of the Second Circuit in the Bevins case an suggestion that while the particular parties

immune from suit.","start":858.362,"stop":881.605,"duration":23.24},{"text":"Now, the distinction has never been applied in Civil Rights Act cases.","start":881.605,"stop":887.836,"duration":6.23},{"text":"In tort cases, the distinction has always been a distinction based upon the immunability of lower level officials to mandamus where there is a positive declaration by law that they must do an act.","start":887.836,"stop":900.226,"duration":12.39},{"text":"So, for example, a court clerk might be subject to mandamus to compel the court clerk to give a copy of the document to somebody.","start":900.226,"stop":909.862,"duration":9.64},{"text":"Similarly, those courts have said where refusal to engage in an act, which could be compelled to a mandamus, could be a basis for liability.","start":909.862,"stop":920.667,"duration":10.81},{"text":"But those courts have also said a discretionary act, that is one not subject to mandamus, might be immune from suit.","start":920.667,"stop":928.602,"duration":7.93},{"text":"Now, to hold that as to the Civil Rights Act seems anomalous.","start":928.602,"stop":934.083,"duration":5.48},{"text":"We might, for example, have a situation in which a senior police official orders a policeman to engage in an unconstitutional act and the situation in which the person who commits the act, who had no basic decision making power, is left holding the bag while the officer who made the decision to engage in the constitutional deprivation is, in fact, immune.","start":934.083,"stop":958.128,"duration":24.05},{"text":"That seems senseless in view of the fact that it was clearly the purpose of the Congress to reach both.","start":958.128,"stop":966.683,"duration":8.55},{"text":"In addition, there doesn’t seem any sensible basis to close the doors of the court with respect to that sort of act.","start":966.683,"stop":974.938,"duration":8.25},{"text":"The distinction between ministerial and discretionary acts, when one clearly looks at it, breaks down.","start":974.938,"stop":980.897,"duration":5.96},{"text":"In fact, at all levels of government, at least when we’re dealing with the question of use of governmental force, discretion is exercised, so that at both levels, the concept of a ministerial discretionary distinction breaks down as being basically inconsistent with the policies sought to be served, excuse me, by the Congress.","start":980.897,"stop":1005.731,"duration":24.83},{"text":"So, what we’re left with then is the bare claim that if officials are subject to suit, it will be troublesome for them.","start":1005.731,"stop":1016.58,"duration":10.85},{"text":"They are too important to be called into court.","start":1016.58,"stop":1018.955,"duration":2.38},{"text":"They’ll have to spend
