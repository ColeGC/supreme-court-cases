Court.","start":17.348,"stop":21.149,"duration":3.8},{"text":"Yesterday, when the argument was interrupted, we were discussing the specific District Court findings.","start":21.149,"stop":29.603,"duration":8.45},{"text":"It will be recalled that the District Court found that the vessel was on sea, and vessel owner negligent in three respects: in failing to secure the cargo in Mobile, in failing to dunnage off the cargo in Mobile, and because of the presence of the piece of the paper covering the crack which was the immediate cause of the plaintiff's injury.","start":29.603,"stop":53.278,"duration":23.67},{"text":"The District Court also found that Cooper was negligent in two respects with respect to the failure to secure and with respect to the failure to dunnage off in Mobile.","start":53.278,"stop":65.984,"duration":12.71},{"text":"Now, the precise legal significance of these findings has to be rather carefully scrutinized.","start":65.984,"stop":75.528,"duration":9.54},{"text":"First of all, it's to be noted that there is no finding of joint liability of the ship and Cooper to the plaintiff.","start":75.528,"stop":86.867,"duration":11.34},{"text":"There is no finding of joint liability because the plaintiff, if it will be recalled, did not sue Cooper.","start":86.867,"stop":96.419,"duration":9.55},{"text":"Now, the significance of this is that since the plaintiff did not sue Cooper, there is thus no and I am quoting here from respondent's brief, “No common liability for concurrent fault” which is,' and again I am to use the words of the respondent's brief at page 25 which is the 'sine qua non of contribution'.","start":96.419,"stop":120.886,"duration":24.47},{"text":"That is, there is no joint liability because the plaintiff didn't sue Cooper.","start":120.886,"stop":129.317,"duration":8.43},{"text":"The second significance of the District Court's findings is that Cooper negligence was found to be negligence vis-à-vis the plaintiff.","start":129.317,"stop":141.55,"duration":12.23},{"text":"That is the acts which Cooper did.","start":141.55,"stop":144.689,"duration":3.14},{"text":"The failing to secure and the failing to done a job were found on a careful examination of the District Court's findings at a 163 and 164 of the appendix are found to be negligence because of -- this created a risk of harm to the plaintiff and subsequent longshoreman.","start":144.689,"stop":164.949,"duration":20.26},{"text":"But these findings are legally immaterial because again the plaintiff for tactical considerations did not sue Cooper.","start":164.949,"stop":175.185,"duration":10.24},{"text":"The third legal significance to these findings is that under these findings and under the undisputed fact, there is not found to be any breach of duty by Cooper to the vessel.","start":175.185,"stop":191.535,"duration":16.35},{"text":"Because the two things Cooper was faulted for, failing to secure and failing to dunnage as between the ship and Cooper.","start":191.535,"stop":199.767,"duration":8.23},{"text":"The ultimate decision there was made by the ship.","start":199.767,"stop":203.528,"duration":3.76},{"text":"It was the ship that decided whether or not to dunnage.","start":203.528,"stop":206.851,"duration":3.32},{"text":"If the ship wanted it dunnaged, the evidence shows Cooper would have dunnage.","start":206.851,"stop":210.818,"duration":3.97},{"text":"If the ship wanted the cargo secure, Cooper would have been happy to secure the cargo for of course an additional price.","start":210.818,"stop":217.355,"duration":6.54},{"text":"But those decisions were decisions of the ship.","start":217.355,"stop":222.528,"duration":5.17},{"text":"Thus, regardless of this Court's treatment of the more general problem before the Court, namely the right of contribution between joint tortfeasors in admiralty, there are two very specific reasons in this specific case, why this is an improper case for contribution.","start":222.528,"stop":242.782,"duration":20.25},{"text":"First of all, because as we have seen that the party which has been granted contribution, the Vessel has already been fully indemnified.","start":242.782,"stop":252.704,"duration":9.92},{"text":"It was fully indemnified by Mid-Gulf Stevedores.","start":252.704,"stop":259.156,"duration":6.45},{"text":"So that if we view the case as one where it is the Vessel which is suing Cooper for contribution, the Vessel's cause of action is extinguished.","start":259.156,"stop":271.133,"duration":11.98},{"text":"The Court might feel but why it isn't the real party at interest here Mid-Gulf, because Mid-Gulf has stepped into the shoes of the Vessel and it has taken over the Vessel's defense.","start":271.133,"stop":282.722,"duration":11.59},{"text":"But if that's the situation, then contribution is doubly unfair because if the plaintiff -- let us change this situations like, had the plaintiff sued Cooper alone.","start":282.722,"stop":297.095,"duration":14.37},{"text":"Let's assume for instance the ship was not -- could not get jurisdiction over the ship but the vessel owner was in souvenir something of that sort.","start":297.095,"stop":305.119,"duration":8.02},{"text":"So, the plaintiff sues only Cooper.","start":305.119,"stop":307.596,"duration":2.48},{"text":"Cooper even under the rule urged by the respondent would not be able to get contribution from Mid-Gulf because Mid-Gulf is statutorily immune from direct action by the plaintiff.","start":307.596,"stop":320.411,"duration":12.81}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
