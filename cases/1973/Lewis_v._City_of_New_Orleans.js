F. police, I am going to Giarrusso about this.”","start":101.398,"stop":109.978,"duration":8.58},{"text":"I think the part, “I am going to Giarrusso about this,” should not be ignored.","start":109.978,"stop":114.409,"duration":4.43},{"text":"Giarrusso is the Superintendent of Police in New Orleans, a high public official and a comment by Mallie Lewis reflects an intention to complain as an expression of some First Amendment interest.","start":114.409,"stop":129.089,"duration":14.68},{"text":"The ultimate issue in the case is one of the limits of protest and expression of anger by a citizen who feels aggrieved by police conduct.","start":129.089,"stop":140.698,"duration":11.61},{"text":"Statute under which Mallie Lewis was convicted provides that, it shall be unlawful and a breach of the peace for any person wantonly to curse or revile or to use obscene or opprobrious language toward all with reference to any member of the city police while in the actual performance of his duty.","start":140.698,"stop":158.877,"duration":18.18},{"text":"When this case was last before the Court, that ordinance had never been the subject of any sort of construction and had been upheld all the way along the line on its face.","start":158.877,"stop":170.127,"duration":11.25},{"text":"It had never in fact received any recent consideration.","start":170.127,"stop":174.247,"duration":4.12},{"text":"In light of this Court’s vacating the original judgment and the remand of the Supreme Court of Louisiana has once again affirmed the appellant’s conviction this time with an opinion.","start":174.247,"stop":188.875,"duration":14.63},{"text":"The position of the appellant that the opinion below of the Louisiana Supreme Court is not a narrowing construction of the ordinance, that it does not resolve the constitutional problems and that it leaves punishable language, which is merely opprobrious, language that this Court held in Gooding versus Wilson cannot be punished.","start":188.875,"stop":208.96,"duration":20.09},{"text":"I think the point that most clearly emphasizes this is the provision in the statute that the language need not only be spoken towards the police but maybe spoken merely with reference to the police.","start":208.96,"stop":221.687,"duration":12.73},{"text":"This issue was raised right from the very beginning.","start":221.687,"stop":225.567,"duration":3.88},{"text":"The problem with in reference to the police, the problem of statements made out of the hearing of the particular police officer spoken about.","start":225.567,"stop":234.333,"duration":8.77},{"text":"It’s an obvious -- an apparently obvious defect in an ordinance that might otherwise be made applicable to fighting words.","start":234.333,"stop":241.347,"duration":7.01},{"text":"But nowhere does the opinion of the Louisiana Supreme Court below address that issue and yet it was very clearly before the Court the dissent, picked it up at great length below but the majority ignored it.","start":241.347,"stop":258.423,"duration":17.08},{"text":"And I submit that what the majority did below was justified that ordinance on its face which cannot be done under this Court’s holding in Gooding.","start":258.423,"stop":270.609,"duration":12.19},{"text":"Now admittedly, the court below does refer to fighting words on a couple of occasions in its opinions but it never articulates what the fighting words standard means.","start":270.609,"stop":283.581,"duration":12.97},{"text":"Whether it is the dictum of Chaplinsky that fighting words of those which are likely to provoke violence or the mere utterance of which inflicts injury or the holding of Chaplinsky and the holding of Gooding that the only language punishable is that which is likely to provoke a violent response.","start":283.581,"stop":304.813,"duration":21.23},{"text":"I think what the Louisiana Supreme Court did below is similar to what the California Courts had done with the ordinance involved in Cohen versus California.","start":304.813,"stop":316.422,"duration":11.61},{"text":"And in that case, the late Mr. Justice Harlan noted in the footnote that although the Supreme Court of California had limited the scope of the ordinance to utterances likely to result in violence.","start":316.422,"stop":329.154,"duration":12.73},{"text":"It had more or less made a per se holding that all obscene language or epithets of the type uttered by Cohen were in all cases likely to provoke violence.","start":329.154,"stop":339.645,"duration":10.49},{"text":"And that’s basically the way the Louisiana Supreme Court below has afforded this Court’s holding in Gooding by simply deciding, okay, all opprobrious and obscene language is fighting words and that is the end of it.","start":339.645,"stop":353.112,"duration":13.47},{"text":"But I think that circumvents this Court’s holding completely.","start":353.112,"stop":357.302,"duration":4.19},{"text":"I think an ordinance like this because of the manner in which it is enforced and the courts in which it is enforced presents a good case for the application of the “overbreadth” doctrine.","start":357.302,"stop":369.679,"duration":12.38},{"text":"The ordinance has been on the books in Louisiana and enforced in New Orleans for 77 years but until this past couple of years has not been the subject of any appellate decisions whatsoever.","start":369.679,"stop":383.501,"duration":13.82},{"text":"It is not the sort of ordinance that is going to effectively narrowed on a case by case basis.","start":383.501,"stop":389.657,"duration":6.16},{"text":"The whole ordinance is overbroad, it must be thrown out and standard set for how to write a good ordinance, how the legislative authorities in New Orleans can address themselves to the problems.","start":389.657,"stop":405.527,"duration":15.87},{"text":"There is implicit in the opinion of the Supreme Court below that an ordinance such as this can be justified as opposed to the ordinance involved in Gooding because of the limitation of the ordinance to language spoken of the police.","start":405.527,"stop":424.037,"duration":18.51},{"text":"I think the interest involved tend to cut the other way and of anything the fact that this ordinance is limited to language spoken of the police suggests that the standard should be even tighter and more rigorous and that this Court should assure that the fighting word standard is not abused in this context.","start":424.037,"stop":446.073,"duration":22.04},{"text":"I think it is necessary to go back to the facts again because I don’t think it is clear at all that what Mallie Lewis uttered were in fact fighting words.","start":446.073,"stop":458.067,"duration":11.99},{"text":"It was an expression of anger.","start":458.067,"stop":461.261,"duration":3.19},{"text":"Someone might pound their fist in anger or pull a hair in anger or simply if they were a person of great self-control say, “I am angry.”","start":461.261,"stop":470.533,"duration":9.27},{"text":"The comment was directed at all police generally, not just the police officer there.","start":470.533,"stop":476.851,"duration":6.32},{"text":"Tied in with it was a statement that I am aggrieved, I am going to complain.","start":476.851,"stop":481.57,"duration":4.72},{"text":"I do not think Police Officer Berner could legitimately feel that the language addressed to him by Mallie Lewis was intended to provoke him.","start":481.57,"stop":491.572,"duration":10},{"text":"And
