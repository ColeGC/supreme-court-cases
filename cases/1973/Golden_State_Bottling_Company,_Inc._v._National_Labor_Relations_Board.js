view with respect to the two specific limitations on its power.","start":42.508,"stop":65.31,"duration":22.8},{"text":"I'm speaking of the limitation contents in Section 10 (c) of the Act itself.","start":65.31,"stop":72.258,"duration":6.95},{"text":"The limitations contained in rule 65 particularly 65 (d) of the Federal rules of civil procedure.","start":72.258,"stop":81.057,"duration":8.8},{"text":"I think those limitations are the ones that the board has attempted to dispense with in reaching the result that it's reached in this case on a successorship issue which is the heart of this case.","start":81.057,"stop":97.454,"duration":16.4},{"text":"The board and the writers tend to sweep these limitations aside.","start":97.454,"stop":102.75,"duration":5.3},{"text":"Of course the 10 (c) the heart of that again is that states that the board's remedial powers must be exercised only against those who have actually engaged in unfair labor practices or are engaging in them.","start":102.75,"stop":117.224,"duration":14.47},{"text":"And the language of Section 65 (d) which had such penetrating analysis in the Regal Knitwear case has to do with the circumstances under which a successor or an assigned maybe drawn within the ambit of an order directed to a wrong doer.","start":117.224,"stop":139.503,"duration":22.28},{"text":"Now, as I see the board tends to shut these off really by saying, first it is also in the same Section 10 (c) given broad remedial powers to effectuate the policies of the Act and consider them in light of this.","start":139.503,"stop":158.871,"duration":19.37},{"text":"At the end, it has in mind really justifies the means as taken.","start":158.871,"stop":165.406,"duration":6.53},{"text":"And it tends to treat the limitations imposed by the two Sections I just mentioned as something rather technical or rather arbitrary and arbitrary but technical at any rate, and something that must give away before an argument addressed to considerations of substance such as effectuating the policies of the Act.","start":165.406,"stop":188.558,"duration":23.15},{"text":"In answer to that, I would say it first and I think again this is fundamental.","start":188.558,"stop":194.233,"duration":5.68},{"text":"That both of these sections are not technical.","start":194.233,"stop":197.928,"duration":3.69},{"text":"Their terms and body

we are talking about is affording a party hearing, yes.","start":208.579,"stop":217.37,"duration":8.79},{"text":"And that one of the vices inherent in what the board has done is to deny a party a

wrong doing who is totally innocent of any wrongful conduct.","start":217.37,"stop":243.486,"duration":26.12},{"text":"This is what we are getting

authority.","start":393.894,"stop":403.651,"duration":9.76},{"text":"And then it goes on the say the courts may not grant in the celebrated language an enforcement order or an injunction so broad as
