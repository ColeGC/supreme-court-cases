extortion.","start":305.611,"stop":309.693,"duration":4.08},{"text":"And I think that's apparent from the language of the Hobbs Act, which has three clauses.","start":309.693,"stop":315.41,"duration":5.72},{"text":"And the third clause covers acts or threats of violence, quote,","start":315.41,"stop":320.076,"duration":4.67},{"text":"\"in

that refers back to the principal offenses under section 1951, robbery or extortion.","start":330.378,"stop":338.028,"duration":7.65},{"text":"Now, the Respondent's position is that the mere act of obstructing commerce, or affecting commerce, or, I suppose, even delaying commerce, is a violation of the Hobbs Act.","start":338.028,"stop":348.089,"duration":10.06},{"text":"And I don't think it's

foreclosed.","start":351.339,"stop":354.135,"duration":2.8},{"text":"Now, if there's any doubt about that, based on the language of the Hobbs Act, as amended in 1948, one need only look back to the 1946 version of the Hobbs Act, as originally passed.","start":354.135,"stop":365.19,"duration":11.06},{"text":"And there, it... there's no debate that Congress intended to cover acts or threats of physical violence only if undertaken in furtherance of a plan or purpose to commit robbery or extortion.","start":365.19,"stop":375.14,"duration":9.95},{"text":"So, Respondent's position rises or falls on the proposition that in 1948, when Congress recodified and revised all of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, it dramatically expanded the Hobbs Act.","start":375.14,"stop":390.554,"duration":15.41},{"text":"This Court, in reviewing revision and recodification statutes, applies special rules of construction.","start":390.554,"stop":398.69,"duration":8.14},{"text":"It requires the clear statement... or clear expression of intent to make a substantive change; and, if there isn't one, it assumes that no substantive change was intended.","start":398.69,"stop":407.006,"duration":8.32},{"text":"If you look at the revisor's notes to section 1951(a) in the 1948 revision, it's clear that there is no intent to make any substantive change.","start":407.006,"stop":416.484,"duration":9.48},{"text":"So, I think the Court really doesn't need to go any further on that second issue to rule in the Petitioner's favor.","start":416.484,"stop":421.94,"duration":5.46}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"The question is whether the Court should rule on it, as in a matter of first decision.","start":421.94,"stop":432.031,"duration":10.09},{"text":"We are a court of review.","start":432.031,"stop":433.446,"duration":1.42},{"text":"There was no determination of whether the Hobbs Act included such a category in the Seventh Circuit.","start":433.446,"stop":441.931,"duration":8.48},{"text":"So, the difficulty, the impediment to addressing your position is that however strong it may be, it wasn't resolved below, so why shouldn't we follow the natural order that first the District Court speaks, and then the Court of Appeals, and then it comes here?","start":441.931,"stop":468.942,"duration":27.01}]},{"speakerName":"Alan Edward Untereiner","textObjs":[{"text":"Justice Ginsburg, I understand the concern, but the Seventh Circuit did

crimes.","start":482.002,"stop":487.377,"duration":5.38},{"text":"It said that both... it rejected our plain language argument.","start":487.377,"stop":490.185,"duration":2.81},{"text":"It went on and

appeal.","start":512.654,"stop":517.477,"duration":4.82},{"text":"It did resolve the issue, insofar as it held that the Hobbs Act may plausibly be read to cover freestanding acts for threats of
