thinks that that speech is being misattributed to the schools.","start":3386.218,"stop":3390.6,"duration":4.38},{"text":"Even in the secondary school context, in Mergens, this Court understood that secondary students could distinguish between the school's message and that of school groups.","start":3390.6,"stop":3399.408,"duration":8.81},{"text":"Now, the second piece of speech that's at issue is that of the university, when they incidentally send an email around telling the students where the military recruiters are going to be on a certain day.","start":3399.408,"stop":3410.411,"duration":11},{"text":"And certainly in the context of recruiting, that kind of incidental speech does not implicate any compelled speech doctrine.","start":3410.411,"stop":3418.641,"duration":8.23},{"text":"In the Title VII context, for example, if an employer says that there's a job opening, and says that to a white applicant, it has to say the same thing to an African American applicant.","start":3418.641,"stop":3429.06,"duration":10.42},{"text":"Nobody would think that that other... saying that to the African American applicant, which is, of course, compelled speech by Title VII, violates the Constitution.","start":3429.06,"stop":3437.375,"duration":8.32},{"text":"I would also say, just as the last point on compelled speech, that it's something of a stranger in a strange land in the context of this case, since we are talking about a funding condition, not a compulsion.","start":3437.375,"stop":3447.544,"duration":10.17},{"text":"Second, let me move to the argument that the Respondents have about trying to distinguish this case from Justice Stevens' World War II hypothetical.","start":3447.544,"stop":3455.608,"duration":8.06},{"text":"And, as I understand it, it boils down to the argument that the way that the legislature was reacting here to this

Bray, of Indiana, said that this was an effort to get at \"communist stooges and beatniks\".","start":3487.359,"stop":3492.819,"duration":5.46},{"text":"Now, this Court did not strike the statute down

courts.","start":3559.277,"stop":3564.219,"duration":4.94},{"text":"And, beyond that, I think, even in this case, there is more at issue here than just the military's policy on
