Souter","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Phillips, on that point, if the State of West Virginia had had, prior to your client's conduct here, a clear rule, whether it be a rule of statute or previously announced common law, to the effect that punitive damages may be awarded by reference not merely to the verdict in the tort action, but by reference to the extent... the economic extent of the harm either intended or potentially threatened by the tort, even though not realized, would you say that there was either a procedural or a substantive due process violation in applying that rule?","start":368.43,"stop":409.429,"duration":41}]},{"speakerName":"Carter G.
