petitioners, with their parents, sued in the State courts of California alleging that the birth defects had been caused by Bendectin and alleging further that Merrell Dow, the sole manufacturer of Bendectin, had been culpable as a matter of State tort law in the manufacture and the distribution of the drug.","start":52.076,"stop":75.371,"duration":23.29},{"text":"Among other things, the allegations are that Merrell had concealed the discoveries in its own laboratories of the effects that this drug had on animals that were tested and that it did not provide a warning consistent with what its own internal knowledge was of the propensities of the drug.","start":75.371,"stop":93.205,"duration":17.83},{"text":"If the cases had remained in State court, it is clear that the expert testimony about causation that is the subject before you today, that that expert testimony would have been admissible as a matter of California law, and we have asserted... and the assertion is not challenged... that that evidence would also have been sufficient as a matter of California law to prove causation in this case.","start":93.205,"stop":118.801,"duration":25.6},{"text":"But Merrell Dow removed both cases to Federal court on diversity grounds, where they were consolidated, and ultimately Merrell moved for summary judgment.","start":118.801,"stop":130.277,"duration":11.48},{"text":"Its motion did not go to the question of culpability but solely to the question of causation, and its contention about causation was that Bendectin does not, in fact, cause birth defects in humans and that the petitioners would be unable to come forward with any admissible evidence that it does.","start":130.277,"stop":155.393,"duration":25.12},{"text":"And they anticipated in the motion that the petitioners indeed would have experts who say that there is causation, but their contention was that testimony would not be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, and in consequence the petitioners would have no admissible evidence to prove causation.","start":155.393,"stop":174.087,"duration":18.69},{"text":"Now, the petitioners countered with affidavits and testimonies of eight experts, and I think it's important to note that these are

opinion that it is likelier than not that Bendectin is a teratogen in humans at the normal therapeutic dose, that is, that it causes birth defects in humans, and each has recited that the methodology

determinations.","start":217.435,"stop":249.167,"duration":31.73},{"text":"Indeed, as is shown, and as the two governmental experts testified, the methodology they used here is precisely that which

these affidavits, make any record demonstration, did not cite a single person who claimed that this methodology was not appropriately employed, but both courts below, responding to and accepting the contention made by Merrell Dow, concluded that the proper measure for determining admissibility of expert testimony under the Federal Rules of Evidence is that which was prescribed in the Frye test, namely that the methods and the principles on which the experts' opinions are based must be those that are generally accepted in the scientific community, and applying that standard, both courts said that that had not been demonstrated in this case by the petitioner.","start":284.219,"stop":332.452,"duration":48.23},{"text":"Now, that poses the question of statutory construction that this case
