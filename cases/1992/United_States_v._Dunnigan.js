Grayson, this Court endorsed that practice.","start":264.055,"stop":269.792,"duration":5.74},{"text":"The Court at the same time also rejected the argument that allowing a trial judge to consider his firsthand observations of the defendant's perjury would amount to punishing the defendant for an uncharged crime or would deter other defendants from taking the stand.","start":269.792,"stop":284.968,"duration":15.18},{"text":"The background principles of law against which Grayson was decided are still vital today.","start":284.968,"stop":291.205,"duration":6.24},{"text":"When the guidelines went into effect on November 1 of 1987, those principles were not changed.","start":291.205,"stop":296.193,"duration":4.99},{"text":"In fact, the Court in cases has made clear that those principles are still valid.","start":296.193,"stop":301.311,"duration":5.12},{"text":"For example, in the last two terms in the Payne and Dawson cases, the Court has made clear that a district court at sentencing is entitled to consider a broad range of information.","start":301.311,"stop":310.751,"duration":9.44},{"text":"In addition, in the case of Nix v. Whiteside the Court has made clear the defendant's right to testify does not include the right to give false testimony.","start":310.751,"stop":318.94,"duration":8.19},{"text":"The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the sentencing guidelines embrace those principles.","start":318.94,"stop":324.177,"duration":5.24},{"text":"As I mentioned to Justice Kennedy, both the act and the guidelines direct the district courts to consider a broad range of evidence at sentencing.","start":324.177,"stop":331.699,"duration":7.52},{"text":"And in particular, the guideline they were concerned with here today, section 3(c)1.1, directs the district courts to enhance a defendant's sentence if the court finds that the defendant committed perjury.","start":331.699,"stop":342.472,"duration":10.77},{"text":"That guideline therefore serves as the vehicle through which the Sentencing Commission and, in each case, the district court can implement the principle that this Court approved in Grayson.","start":342.472,"stop":351.661,"duration":9.19},{"text":"Now, the Fourth Circuit held that that guideline unconstitutionally infringed on the defendant's right to testify and gave several reasons.","start":351.661,"stop":358.6,"duration":6.94},{"text":"We think none of those reasons are sufficient.","start":358.6,"stop":360.984,"duration":2.38},{"text":"To begin with, the court of appeals was troubled by the fact that section 3(c)1.1 classifies a defendant's false trial testimony as the obstruction of justice rather than as simply one factor that a district court can consider or ignore in the exercise of its sentencing discretion.","start":360.984,"stop":377.895,"duration":16.91},{"text":"The label used to describe this factor, however, should be immaterial because the label has no independent effect.","start":377.895,"stop":384.215,"duration":6.32},{"text":"In addition, the guideline is not a disguised means of punishing the defendant for a crime not charged against him.","start":384.215,"stop":390.988,"duration":6.77},{"text":"A defendant who testifies perjuriously at trial thereby indicates his willingness to break the law when he finds it in his interest to do so.","start":390.988,"stop":398.742,"duration":7.75},{"text":"That factor therefore shows the defendant is a greater danger to the community than might otherwise be the case, and therefore in turn is relevant to the question of what period of incarceration is necessary to incapacitate him for the protection of society.","start":398.742,"stop":413.401,"duration":14.66},{"text":"The court of appeals also believed that because this guideline is mandatory, it amounts to the type of wooden or reflex enhancement that this Court criticized in Grayson.","start":413.401,"stop":423.292,"duration":9.89},{"text":"While it is true that Grayson did not direct the district courts in every case to enhance a defendant's sentence if the court found that the defendant committed perjury, Grayson at the same time did not prohibit Congress or the Sentencing Commission from making the judgment across the board that a defendant's trial perjury is an aggravating factor and should be treated as such in every case.","start":423.292,"stop":444.373,"duration":21.08},{"text":"That is precisely what section 3(c)1.1 does.","start":444.373,"stop":448.424,"duration":4.05},{"text":"There is also nothing unusual about codifying this rule or others like it.","start":448.424,"stop":453.328,"duration":4.9},{"text":"The sentencing guidelines codify numerous sentencing factors that prior law had left to the individual discretion of district court judges in each case.","start":453.328,"stop":462.334,"duration":9.01},{"text":"The new mandatory nature of these rules is just the inevitable result of making the choice to target a district court's attention to certain matters deemed aggravating or mitigating and to guide the district court by giving weight to those factors, instead of leaving to each court in each case the authority to make that decision for himself or herself.","start":462.334,"stop":482.729,"duration":20.39},{"text":"If a district court, however, can consider defendant's perjury at trial, and we know from Grayson that it can, a district court then can be channeled in the exercise of that discretion by Congress or the sentencing commission.","start":482.729,"stop":495.388,"duration":12.66},{"text":"The court of appeals also believed that, again, because this guideline is mandatory, it would deter innocent defendants from testifying, especially defendants with prior convictions.","start":495.388,"stop":504.511,"duration":9.12},{"text":"We think that's unlikely.","start":504.511,"stop":506.177,"duration":1.67},{"text":"A defendant who goes to trial has as his overriding concern avoiding a conviction.","start":506.177,"stop":511.515,"duration":5.34},{"text":"A defendant therefore will decide whether to testify based on his assessment of the likelihood that his testimony will increase the prospects of his acquittal.","start":511.515,"stop":519.437,"duration":7.92},{"text":"In making that judgment a defendant will rely on various factors, such as the strength of the Government's case, the strength of the other defense evidence available, the defendant's prior record or other factors that may be used to impeach him, his credibility as a witness, and his ability to withstand cross-examination.","start":519.437,"stop":537.165,"duration":17.73},{"text":"We think it would be a rare case in which a defendant, after balancing all those factors, concludes that he should testify in order to increase his chances of an acquittal, but then nonetheless decides against doing so because of his fear that the jury would erroneously believe he is committing perjury, would therefore erroneously convict him, and that the district court then erroneously would make the same conclusion and enhance his sentence under this guideline.","start":537.165,"stop":563.114,"duration":25.95},{"text":"The Fourth Circuit expressed skepticism that the district courts could or would apply this guideline properly and that courts of appeals could or would police the actions of the district courts.","start":563.114,"stop":573.671,"duration":10.56},{"text":"We see no reason to be pessimistic in this regard.","start":573.671,"stop":576.373,"duration":2.7},{"text":"As I mentioned before, the guideline requires that a defendant's sentence be enhanced if the court makes the finding, independent of the jury's verdict, that the defendant committed perjury.","start":576.373,"stop":587.165,"duration":10.79},{"text":"The district court, therefore, has this responsibility at sentencing, like many of the other responsibilities district courts now have under the guidelines.","start":587.165,"stop":595.319,"duration":8.15},{"text":"We have no fear that the district courts and the courts of appeals will not be able to apply this guideline in the correct manner.","start":595.319,"stop":601.925,"duration":6.61},{"text":"In fact, this Court in Grayson expressed no fear that district courts would misuse the sentencing authority that was recognized in that case.","start":601.925,"stop":609.994,"duration":8.07},{"text":"In Grayson the Court recognized that a judge's oath of office and a judge's integrity would be a sufficient guarantee that district courts may not misuse this factor.","start":609.994,"stop":619.683,"duration":9.69},{"text":"We see no reason today, now, simply because the guidelines are in... in effect, to have any less confidence in the ability of district courts properly to conduct the sentencing proceedings than this Court did back in 1978.","start":619.683,"stop":631.591,"duration":11.91},{"text":"I'd like to reserve the balance of--","start":631.591,"stop":632.541,"duration":0.95}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day
