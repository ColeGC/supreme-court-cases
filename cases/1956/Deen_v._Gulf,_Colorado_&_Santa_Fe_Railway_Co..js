Guthrie","textObjs":[{"text":"This is a case that arises under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.","start":20.386,"stop":30.913,"duration":10.53},{"text":"It involves a workman that was injured in the course of his employment while working for the Santa Fe Railway Company at Brownwood, Texas.","start":30.913,"stop":50.2,"duration":19.29},{"text":"The injury was sustained on July the 12th, 1949.","start":50.2,"stop":59.624,"duration":9.42},{"text":"On that day, a locomotive was in the shops of the company for repair.","start":59.624,"stop":68.784,"duration":9.16},{"text":"The clerk of the general foreman told Deen, who was the coppersmith for the railway company, that we must have this locomotive out of the shops today.","start":68.784,"stop":86.951,"duration":18.17},{"text":"Now, to repair the locomotive, it was necessary to use babbitt which is an alloy of antimony, copper, and tin.","start":86.951,"stop":102.562,"duration":15.61},{"text":"The babbitt that was available was in a steel pot that leaked so badly that it put out the fire which burned underneath the pot in the furnace.","start":102.562,"stop":122.243,"duration":19.68},{"text":"Now, on that very day, the railway company was planning to replace the pot with a new one.","start":122.243,"stop":130.82,"duration":8.58},{"text":"And the foreman told Deen that if he had that old pot off of the furnace and have the furnace ready to be replaced with a new pot, that he could use the men that brought the new pot to lift it upon the furnace and also to place the babbitt in the new pot for melting.","start":130.82,"stop":159.458,"duration":28.64}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Place the babbitt

Guthrie","textObjs":[{"text":"Now, Your Honors, the steel pot weighed about 250 pounds.","start":166.756,"stop":174.826,"duration":8.07},{"text":"And the babbitt that was in the pot weighed some 550 or 600 pounds as I remembered.","start":174.826,"stop":184.98,"duration":10.15},{"text":"The steel pot and the babbitt together weighed almost a half a ton.","start":184.98,"stop":194.005,"duration":9.03},{"text":"Now, right beside the steel pot was a hoist that it then furnished by the railway company for the purpose of lifting heavy object.","start":194.005,"stop":208.707,"duration":14.7},{"text":"Now, this steel pot fitted so snugly in the furnace that it was necessary for Deen to take a crow bar and pries it off to the furnace, a distance about half an -- inch-and-a-half, so that it could be gripped by the arms of the hoist and lift it from the furnace onto the floor.","start":208.707,"stop":238.874,"duration":30.17},{"text":"He revolved the hoist around, fitted the arms of it under the -- under the rim of the steel pot which was a inch-and-a-half to two inches wide, then he tried to take the pot from the furnace to the floor and in the course of the transfer, the steel pot fell to the floor.","start":238.874,"stop":267.672,"duration":28.8},{"text":"And Your Honors, he then tried to overturn the steel pot with the babbitt in it by himself, but he was unable to do so.","start":267.672,"stop":280.193,"duration":12.52},{"text":"A fellow workman and a blacksmith in the shop saw the difficulty that he was in and they voluntarily came to his assistant, then both tried to overturn the steel pot to empty out the babbitt but they were unable to do so.","start":280.193,"stop":299.389,"duration":19.2},{"text":"And then both of them went around to the front of the pot, one braced himself against the furnace, that was Deen, Snow braced himself against the steel bent that was there and they pulled the steel pot towards it.","start":299.389,"stop":316.628,"duration":17.24},{"text":"Just as it reached an upright position, the babbitt slab out of the pot, caught Deen's right leg, mangled him and crippled him for life.","start":316.628,"stop":331.106,"duration":14.48},{"text":"And the case was tried before a jury in the state court at Brownwood, Texas.","start":331.106,"stop":340.275,"duration":9.17},{"text":"The case was submitted to the jury in accordance with Texas process on special issues.","start":340.275,"stop":348.924,"duration":8.65},{"text":"Now, the jury in response to those special issues made the following findings, that the railway company did not furnish Deen proper tools to do his job, that this failure was negligent and that it was approximate cause of Deen's injury.","start":348.924,"stop":374.026,"duration":25.1},{"text":"The jury also found that the railway company did not fail to give Deen proper supervision.","start":374.026,"stop":385.391,"duration":11.37},{"text":"They found that the railway company did not fail to furnish him sufficient help to do the work.","start":385.391,"stop":393.504,"duration":8.11},{"text":"That Deen's failure to use the available help was negligence and this was the proximate cause of his injuries.","start":393.504,"stop":405.588,"duration":12.08},{"text":"But the jury also found that Deen was not negligent in the manner and method that he used to do his work, that the sole cosmic cause of his injuries was not Deen's negligence.","start":405.588,"stop":422.65,"duration":17.06},{"text":"And that the railway could anticipate, could recently anticipate that Deen would do the job in the way and manner in which he did.","start":422.65,"stop":434.542,"duration":11.89},{"text":"And that $39,000 would compensate him for his injuries, but because of his own negligence that that recovery should be reduced 45% or $17,550 leaving him a recovery of $21,450.","start":434.542,"stop":463.254,"duration":28.71},{"text":"Now, Your Honor, the trial court reconciled all of the findings of the jury and rendered judgement in favor of Deen for $21,450.","start":463.254,"stop":480.605,"duration":17.35},{"text":"And that was the only judgement that could be rendered, giving effect to all of the findings of the jury.","start":480.605,"stop":491.344,"duration":10.74},{"text":"Now, the railway company appealed the case to the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, and they set aside the judgement of the trial court and said that Deen should recover nothing.","start":491.344,"stop":507.034,"duration":15.69},{"text":"They didn't even send the case back for a second trial.","start":507.034,"stop":512.78,"duration":5.75},{"text":"And Your Honors, in order for the Court of Civil Appeals to do that they could only give effect to certain findings of the jury and ignore other findings of the jury.","start":512.78,"stop":529.548,"duration":16.77},{"text":"We say that the Court of Civil Appeals deliberately circumvented the findings of the jury in this case.","start":529.548,"stop":540.443,"duration":10.89},{"text":"We say that the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas resorted to certain very obvious devices in order to do this.","start":540.443,"stop":551.401,"duration":10.96},{"text":"In the first place, they construed our pleadings strictly against us.","start":551.401,"stop":559.55,"duration":8.15},{"text":"And, Your Honors, pleadings in Texas are very liberally construed.","start":559.55,"stop":567.15,"duration":7.6},{"text":"And this is particularly true after verdict of the jury has been rendered.","start":567.15,"stop":574.235,"duration":7.09},{"text":"But in this case, the Court of Civil Appeals strictly construed our pleadings against us.","start":574.235,"stop":583.152,"duration":8.92},{"text":"And we say -- we said in our pleadings that the injuries which Deen sustained, approximately resulting from the railroad -- approximately resulted jointly and severally from the failure of the railroad to furnish proper tools and from the failure of the railway to furnish sufficient help to do this job.","start":583.152,"stop":616.325,"duration":33.17},{"text":"That is true that in another part of our pleadings we said that the railway company either failed to furnish proper tools or to furnish sufficient help.","start":616.325,"stop":632.453,"duration":16.13},{"text":"Now, instead of construing our pleadings levelly, the Court of Civil Appeals ceased upon that allegation where we said that it either ought to be the one or the other.","start":632.453,"stop":644.299,"duration":11.85},{"text":"They said that put the burden upon us to prove two acts of negligence in order to succeed in the case, and that the railway company only had to disprove either proper help, either sufficient help, or proper tools in order to succeed.","start":644.299,"stop":663.276,"duration":18.98},{"text":"Now, the second thing that the Court of Civil Appeals did, if -- if Your Honors please, is that they said that all findings that the jury made in favor of the railway company was amply supported by the evidence, whereas no findings that the jury made in favor of the injured worker was supported by the evidence.","start":663.276,"stop":692.484,"duration":29.21}]},{"speakerName":"Charles E.

correct.","start":730.063,"stop":732.033,"duration":1.97},{"text":"I think that's correct.","start":732.033,"stop":733.867,"duration":1.83},{"text":"And I -- I'm charging the Court of Civil Appeals that deliberately circumventing the findings of the jury.","start":733.867,"stop":743.49,"duration":9.62},{"text":"Now, Your Honors, the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas did a third thing to get around this jury verdict.","start":743.49,"stop":753.286,"duration":9.8},{"text":"They made a finding for the jury that the jury did not make for itself.","start":753.286,"stop":759.817,"duration":6.53},{"text":"They say that the finding of the jury that the railway furnished sufficient help to do this work, and that Deen was negligence for not using additional help and they said this was the approximate cause of his injuries.","start":759.817,"stop":780.059,"duration":20.24},{"text":"They construed that to mean that the railroad company had furnished a safe method to Deen to do this job, and therefore, since they had furnished him one safe method that they didn't have to furnish him another.","start":780.059,"stop":795.704,"duration":15.64},{"text":"But the jury didn't say that, Your Honor, and we didn't plead our case that way.","start":795.704,"stop":800.566,"duration":4.86},{"text":"We said that both proper tools and sufficient help were necessary to do the job safely.","start":800.566,"stop":809.504,"duration":8.94},{"text":"And if there's going to be any implied findings made which can -- which it can be made in support of the jury verdict, those implied findings have to be consistent with the findings that the jury made and consistent with the theory upon which the case was tried in the trial court.","start":809.504,"stop":829.258,"duration":19.75},{"text":"Those implied findings are made by the trial judge and not by the Court of Civil Appeals.","start":829.258,"stop":838.768,"duration":9.51},{"text":"Now, Your Honor, the Court of Civil Appeals in construing that this was a safe -- that the jury finding of sufficient help was a safe method of doing this job meant that the Court of Civil Appeals found that the railway company furnished a safe method to do the job when the railroad company itself plead that they didn't furnish Deen any method to do the job.","start":838.768,"stop":872.693,"duration":33.92},{"text":"They said that he himself selected his own method and if there's any negligence in the way he did it then that it was Deen's own negligence.","start":872.693,"stop":881.357,"duration":8.66},{"text":"And that they didn't give him any instructions at all.","start":881.357,"stop":884.699,"duration":3.34},{"text":"But even though the railway company plead that they didn't furnish him any method for doing the work, the Court of Civil Appeals found that they furnished him a safe method for doing it.","start":884.699,"stop":896.418,"duration":11.72},{"text":"Now furthermore, Your Honors, the position of the railway company in the trial court was that this accident would have happened no matter how many men that you had there at the time of the injury.","start":896.418,"stop":910.405,"duration":13.99},{"text":"That when you raise the steel pot in upright position that the babbitt was going to slip out as a whole -- a whole shop had been there, and Deen said it might have fallen on two ovens instead of one if more workers have been there.","start":910.405,"stop":926.816,"duration":16.41},{"text":"But even though the railway company took that position in the trial court, the Court of Civil Appeals says that the evidence was sufficient to show that they had furnished him a safe method to do the work because they furnished him enough help to do it.","start":926.816,"stop":945.487,"duration":18.67},{"text":"So if the Court of Civil Appeals' decision, Your Honor, resulted in the Court of Civil Appeals construing the evidence more favorably to Deen than the railroad itself construe the evidence.","start":945.487,"stop":962.881,"duration":17.39},{"text":"Now, is it a travesty on justice that Deen is told by the Court of Civil Appeals to limp through life without any compensation because of a fact that the Railway Company said had nothing to do with the accident?","start":962.881,"stop":985.581,"duration":22.7}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr.

here to do two things.","start":996.203,"stop":1000.673,"duration":4.47},{"text":"One is to defend the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals in this case and the other is to answer the questions to the best of my ability.","start":1000.673,"stop":1011.576,"duration":10.9},{"text":"The Court asked me questions about this Court's jurisdiction or to the extent with which the -- this Court can supervise state court practice, you'll only find out that I'm pretty ignorant of that.","start":1011.576,"stop":1022.412,"duration":10.84},{"text":"That I -- my knowledge of that is very superficial and you'll get a layman's opinion.","start":1022.412,"stop":1028.045,"duration":5.63},{"text":"I think having tried this case in the trial court, having the brief in the Court of Civil Appeals in the Supreme Court of Texas and having written the brief here, I think I am familiar with the record.","start":1028.045,"stop":1038.042,"duration":10},{"text":"I think that I'd like to defend the Court of Civil Appeals' opinion on the three grounds that the Court there gave.","start":1038.042,"stop":1049.679,"duration":11.64},{"text":"Those three grounds were these.","start":1049.679,"stop":1053.026,"duration":3.35},{"text":"We start of with the fundamentals of Master and Servant law, that is that the employer's duty is to furnish a reasonably safe way to do the work.","start":1053.026,"stop":1065.646,"duration":12.62},{"text":"There are others but that's the one that's here.","start":1065.646,"stop":1069.164,"duration":3.52},{"text":"Now, in this case the charge and in spite of Mr. Guthrie's statement, there is no question but the pleadings in this case were in line with what I'm about to say.","start":1069.164,"stop":1082.44,"duration":13.28},{"text":"The charge that we should have furnished a reasonably safe way to do the work were that we should have furnished adequate help to do the work with safety or adequate tools to do the work with safety.","start":1082.44,"stop":1094.648,"duration":12.21},{"text":"Their pleadings recognize that it was no duty to furnish two ways to do the work in safety.","start":1094.648,"stop":1100.263,"duration":5.62},{"text":"There is no duty on the master to furnish several safe ways.","start":1100.263,"stop":1104.242,"duration":3.98},{"text":"In this case, the jury -- the jury found that we furnished adequate help.","start":1104.242,"stop":1110.245,"duration":6},{"text":"Now, there was no tools furnished.","start":1110.245,"stop":1112.305,"duration":2.06},{"text":"There was no -- there was -- wasn't a way that the railroad furnished.","start":1112.305,"stop":1115.802,"duration":3.5},{"text":"This work had been done before, Deen had done it before and he had always done it manually with adequate help.","start":1115.802,"stop":1123.56,"duration":7.76},{"text":"On this occasion he chose not to get the help.","start":1123.56,"stop":1127.127,"duration":3.57},{"text":"The help was available and the jury found it was available.","start":1127.127,"stop":1129.63,"duration":2.5},{"text":"He could have done it safely with the means provided by the employer.","start":1129.63,"stop":1134.329,"duration":4.7},{"text":"The employer furnished a reasonably safe means to do the work.","start":1134.329,"stop":1138.569,"duration":4.24},{"text":"Now, I'm going to have to come back to that, but I want to state my three points if I may.","start":1138.569,"stop":1144.261,"duration":5.69},{"text":"The second point that the Court of Civil Appeals held against the petitioner was that having by his pleadings alleged that we had the duty of furnishing either adequate help to do the work in safety or sufficient tools, he had the burden of proving that we didn't either.","start":1144.261,"stop":1163.733,"duration":19.47},{"text":"Now, that's in accordance with our Texas rules of pleading that are applicable to all civil cases.","start":1163.733,"stop":1169.029,"duration":5.3},{"text":"And since they found that we furnished adequate help, he hadn't sustained the burden of his pleadings and consequently the jury verdict was in favor of the defendant.","start":1169.029,"stop":1182.15,"duration":13.12},{"text":"The third reason was that under the record in the case, there was no evidence of negligence in failing to furnish sufficient tool.","start":1182.15,"stop":1191.544,"duration":9.39},{"text":"Now, if I may come back and take those in that order, this was not a steel pot as Mr. Guthrie said, it was a cast iron pot.","start":1191.544,"stop":1201.824,"duration":10.28},{"text":"And for some reason or rather when the petitioner printed the record, the pictures which were there to -- would show the situation were not printed, and with Mr. Guthrie's permission I put two of them in the back of my brief, and I think with one picture is worth at least 5000 of the lawyer's word and you can see the situation by looking at the pictures in the pocket part of the pale green brief.","start":1201.824,"stop":1230.661,"duration":28.84},{"text":"There are two pictures there and I'll wait a second to let the Court -- there are two pictures.","start":1230.661,"stop":1238.104,"duration":7.44},{"text":"One of them is a picture of a man holding up this cast iron pot.","start":1238.104,"stop":1244.259,"duration":6.15},{"text":"The man is Snow who was the witness in the case and the man that was helping Deen when he was hurt.","start":1244.259,"stop":1250.839,"duration":6.58},{"text":"He is holding it up and the slab of babbitt is in front of it.","start":1250.839,"stop":1255.403,"duration":4.56},{"text":"Now, that's the old pot.","start":1255.403,"stop":1257.27,"duration":1.87},{"text":"Now, just to the right is the -- what you call a babbitt furnace.","start":1257.27,"stop":1263.704,"duration":6.43},{"text":"The hole in the bottom of the pot is not a drain, this thing looks a whole lot like a kitchen sink, old fashion kitchen sink without a drain.","start":1263.704,"stop":1272.088,"duration":8.38},{"text":"That's what a babbitt pot is, a little deeper and a little longer but it looked like a kitchen sink.","start":1272.088,"stop":1277.027,"duration":4.94},{"text":"That's not a drain, that's a crack that had been in the pot for some time and that was the reason that it had to be replaced.","start":1277.027,"stop":1284.481,"duration":7.45},{"text":"Now, a babbitt pot lasts indefinitely, I think the record in this case will support the statement that it lasts five or ten years, and this wasn't something that had to be done everyday.","start":1284.481,"stop":1295.044,"duration":10.56},{"text":"Now, looking at the other picture which is Exhibit 5 and most of these pictures were identified by the plaintiff himself, you will see the picture of the so-called babbitt furnace with a new pot in it.","start":1295.044,"stop":1308.028,"duration":12.98},{"text":"That is the way it looked before Deen took it on and put it on the floor.","start":1308.028,"stop":1312.571,"duration":4.54},{"text":"Just to the right of the furnace itself is the babbitt pot on the floor and the slab of -- of babbitt in front of it.","start":1312.571,"stop":1321.987,"duration":9.42},{"text":"Now, this is as obvious there, this is just a -- a gas -- a fired pot in which they keep babbitt and they heat it up and melt it.","start":1321.987,"stop":1331.762,"duration":9.77},{"text":"I think Deen testified that it was kept hot all the time when the shop was going.","start":1331.762,"stop":1336.852,"duration":5.09},{"text":"In that second picture there is a post, it looked silver there and to that was attached this hoist that was used primarily to raise and lower a different piece or pieces of equipment into the babbitt pot, it wasn't put there to raise the babbitt pot out, it was to raise and lower things in it where there'd be babbitt in it.","start":1336.852,"stop":1359.573,"duration":22.72},{"text":"This -- what Deen was doing, he'd gotten that babbitt pot out and he got it on the floor.","start":1359.573,"stop":1366.547,"duration":6.97},{"text":"And it happened that that crack in there had been discovered some three or four weeks before and he had taken the pot out, dumped the
