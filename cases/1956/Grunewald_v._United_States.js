convicted in the Southern District of New York of conspiracy to bring about corrupt Revenue Department decisions and fraud of the United States and to conceal the crime from all investigating agencies in the future.","start":28.149,"stop":55.777,"duration":27.63},{"text":"The significant feature for present purposes is that element of concealment because without it prosecutions of the crime would have been barred admittedly by the statute of limitations and it is admitted by the Government, was conceded upon the trial that they had proven no act within the limitations period except an act of concealment.","start":55.777,"stop":83.158,"duration":27.38},{"text":"The conviction on this conspiracy count, which is count one of the indictment in the record, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with Judge Frank dissenting.","start":83.158,"stop":96.69,"duration":13.53},{"text":"The majority held that there was, as part of the original crime, a conspiracy to conceal for all the future and therefore subsequent acts of concealment sufficed to bring the original crime down within the period of the statute of limitations.","start":96.69,"stop":121.967,"duration":25.28},{"text":"Judge Frank's dissenting held that the conviction was improper under the principles stated by this Court in the Krulewitch case and the Lutwak case in which this Court held that no conspiracy to continue to conceal a crime which had been accomplished would be implied from the crime itself and that subsequent acts of concealment would not serve to extend the life of the conspiracy because it would destroy the statute of limitations and would make one man, who would conspire with another, responsible for the other's acts for all the future.","start":121.967,"stop":172.156,"duration":50.19},{"text":"For example, if he went out three or four years after the crime and shot a witness, if you are going to imply a conspiracy to conceal, why all of the original conspirators would be responsible.","start":172.156,"stop":186.235,"duration":14.08},{"text":"Now, in order to see how those principles fit into this case, I should give Your Honors a brief outline of the facts.","start":186.235,"stop":195.227,"duration":8.99},{"text":"In 1948, there were two corporate taxpayers who are being investigated for income tax fraud by the Fraud Bureau of the Internal Revenue.","start":195.227,"stop":207.889,"duration":12.66},{"text":"The function of that Bureau was to determine whether or not to recommend criminal prosecution.","start":207.889,"stop":214.261,"duration":6.37},{"text":"And under their administrative practice if at any point in their investigation they determine not to recommend criminal prosecution, the criminal phase ends and the matter is then remitted to the civil side for assessment of taxes, penalties, whatever it may be.","start":214.261,"stop":232.639,"duration":18.38},{"text":"The point is that the critical thing in such an investigation is to get a recommendation of no criminal prosecution.","start":232.639,"stop":241.099,"duration":8.46},{"text":"Both of these taxpayers, one was named Gotham Beef Company and the other Patullo Modes were represented by the same firm of attorneys in New York.","start":241.099,"stop":252.907,"duration":11.81},{"text":"That firm headed up by a man named Davis.","start":252.907,"stop":255.612,"duration":2.7},{"text":"Davis was a Government witness and testified that through the petitioner Halperin, help was obtained from the petitioner Grunewald, whom I represent, to bring about that recommendation.","start":255.612,"stop":270.815,"duration":15.2},{"text":"The theory being that Grunewald was a friend of the third petitioner, Bolich who during the period in question was an official in the Internal Revenue Department.","start":270.815,"stop":284.23,"duration":13.42},{"text":"During part of the time he was the head of the New York office of the Fraud Bureau and thereafter was an Assistant Commissioner of Internal Revenue with authority in the premises.","start":284.23,"stop":296.297,"duration":12.07},{"text":"The Gotham Beef Company decision came down in October 1948, no criminal prosecution.","start":296.297,"stop":303.667,"duration":7.37},{"text":"On January 10, 1949, the Patullo Modes decision was announced, no criminal prosecution.","start":303.667,"stop":310.967,"duration":7.3},{"text":"The indictment in this case was found October 25, 1954, a lapse of almost six years with admittedly a three-year statute of limitation.","start":310.967,"stop":322.313,"duration":11.35},{"text":"Now, how is the gap filled?","start":322.313,"stop":325.613,"duration":3.3},{"text":"In February of 1952, there was impaneled in Brooklyn, New York a grand jury to investigate these cases and perhaps others.","start":325.613,"stop":336.922,"duration":11.31},{"text":"That grand jury subpoenaed before it at least three witnesses from the two taxpayer companies and it appeared that in February and March on three different occasions at one point Davis spoke to one of those witness, Davis was the attorney who had represented the taxpayers originally.","start":336.922,"stop":360.383,"duration":23.46},{"text":"Davis spoke to one of them and found out he was going to testify and said he was crazy to do so and he ought to at least to consult some other attorneys and his current attorneys before he did it.","start":360.383,"stop":373.627,"duration":13.24},{"text":"On two other occasions, Mr. Halperin, the petitioner in 184 I believe it is, spoke to the other two witnesses and said he was going to rely on his constitutional rights.","start":373.627,"stop":387.923,"duration":14.3},{"text":"He was going to stand silent.","start":387.923,"stop":389.534,"duration":1.61},{"text":"He has been subpoenaed also before the grand jury and he thought it would be a wise thing for everybody to do so and perhaps the whole thing would flow over.","start":389.534,"stop":401.224,"duration":11.69},{"text":"Now, those three items are claimed to be items of concealment, those three incidents.","start":401.224,"stop":409.481,"duration":8.26},{"text":"There's a fourth item but perhaps while among those three I might mention parenthetically that those three incidents were made the subject of substantive counts of attempting to interfere with witnesses, counts five, six and seven in the indictment.","start":409.481,"stop":428.692,"duration":19.21},{"text":"But the trial court acquitted all defendants on those counts and sent them to the jury only as against the defendant Halperin.","start":428.692,"stop":439.846,"duration":11.15},{"text":"However, they remained in the case from the Government's standpoint on the theory that they are attempts to conceal.","start":439.846,"stop":448.568,"duration":8.72},{"text":"There the fourth item of concealment that I mentioned is one involving directly my client Grunewald.","start":448.568,"stop":455.971,"duration":7.4},{"text":"He lived here in Washington and in May of 1952, a girl who lived here and who had been his part-time secretary for some several months in the latter part of 1949, after these cases had been disposed of, and for some several months in the latter part of 1950 was subpoenaed to appear before that Brooklyn grand jury and presumably to tell whatever she might know about Grunewald.","start":455.971,"stop":486.422,"duration":30.45},{"text":"He in speaking with her immediately thereafter has said, “They can't do that.","start":486.422,"stop":490.928,"duration":4.51},{"text":"They can't require you to tell my personal affairs and you could say you don't remember.”","start":490.928,"stop":498.272,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Now, accepting that as an act of concealment, we have three to three-and-half years after the event.","start":498.272,"stop":510.621,"duration":12.35},{"text":"I'm omitting an incident of 1950 which the trial court omitted and discharged, which doesn't affect the principle and just for simplicity's sake.","start":510.621,"stop":519.631,"duration":9.01},{"text":"We have these incidents of three to three-and-half years after the event of possible efforts at concealment.","start":519.631,"stop":528.327,"duration":8.7},{"text":"And I think if that were the only question before Your Honors, it would be clear that the decisions in Krulewitch and Lutwak apply.","start":528.327,"stop":537.894,"duration":9.57},{"text":"That when the investigation draws close to a man who has committed a crime and he tries to cover up or conceal, that sort of conduct is in the nature of afterthought.","start":537.894,"stop":550.529,"duration":12.63},{"text":"It does not mean that three-and-half years before, all of the conspirators must be deemed to have agreed to conceal for all of the future.","start":550.529,"stop":561.537,"duration":11.01},{"text":"So, we have to go back one step further to the period of the original crime, and I may say to Your Honors that this theory is advanced in the Government brief and was relied on likewise by the majority opinion in the court below.","start":561.537,"stop":578.381,"duration":16.84},{"text":"In connection with that phase, the original criminal -- the period of the original crime there are two thoughts that they advanced.","start":578.381,"stop":589.001,"duration":10.62},{"text":"First, they say, the Court of Appeals said it, “Well, these men must have known they were committing a crime.","start":589.001,"stop":598.964,"duration":9.96},{"text":"They must have known that they would be subject to investigation or they might be subject to investigation, so they must have intended to conceal.”","start":598.964,"stop":607.389,"duration":8.42},{"text":"In other words, from the mere fact that they were committing the crime, they must have intended to conceal it.","start":607.389,"stop":613.836,"duration":6.45},{"text":"Now that, Your Honor, is precisely what you said in the Krulewitch case that you rejected in the very word.","start":613.836,"stop":622.335,"duration":8.5},{"text":"So there was one last recourse and that is this.","start":622.335,"stop":628.917,"duration":6.58},{"text":"They say that in the course of the commission of the original crime there was surreptitious conduct.","start":628.917,"stop":636.954,"duration":8.04},{"text":"For example, and these three items are hence relied upon in the Government's brief.","start":636.954,"stop":644.336,"duration":7.38},{"text":"They say that at one point in the course of that original conspiracy.","start":644.336,"stop":648.546,"duration":4.21},{"text":"There was a question of money passing and the conspirators insisted that the money passed or be collected or moved in cash rather than by check and therefore they must be intending to conceal.","start":648.546,"stop":664.698,"duration":16.15},{"text":"At another point, they say that the conspirators did not even disclose to the taxpayers, who were part of the conspiracy, the name of their contact man in Washington, who was said to have been Grunewald.","start":664.698,"stop":689.5,"duration":24.8},{"text":"Therefore, they say they were concealing him.","start":689.5,"stop":693.547,"duration":4.05},{"text":"A third thing, one of the taxpayers had a legal representative who was making certain arguments before the tax authorities.","start":693.547,"stop":702.878,"duration":9.33},{"text":"He was apparently not cognizant of anything else that was going on and the Court of Appeals says, the Government repeats, they did not disclose to him that they had a conspiracy working.","start":702.878,"stop":716.795,"duration":13.92},{"text":"In other words, they didn't tell anybody that they were accomplishing their result by corrupt means, so they were concealing.","start":716.795,"stop":725.712,"duration":8.92},{"text":"And so that you have the question to mere -- does mere (Inaudible) of conduct in the course of the commission of a crime permit an influence that for all of future all of the conspirators are conspiring to conceal from all future investigating agencies.","start":725.712,"stop":746.281,"duration":20.57},{"text":"And I submit to Your Honors that that such an inference isn't wholly unreasonable inference, it's an impossible inference.","start":746.281,"stop":754.727,"duration":8.45},{"text":"Just see what it means.","start":754.727,"stop":756.232,"duration":1.5}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Was that
