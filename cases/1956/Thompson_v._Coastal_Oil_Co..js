Medina.","start":124.04,"stop":137.981,"duration":13.94},{"text":"And as he open -- as petitioner opened the door he found according to his testimony the Medina engaged simultaneously in homosexuality

that evening there was a meeting held in one of the rooms aboard ship to discuss apparently primarily a question of whether this incident would be reported to the coastguard and the coastguard requested to remove this man from the ship as an unfit member of the crew.","start":204.452,"stop":226.719,"duration":22.27},{"text":"That was attended by among others the petitioner and the three men allegedly involved in the pornographic incident.","start":226.719,"stop":236.594,"duration":9.88},{"text":"And the two men that were engaged with Medina in this act, one named Pittaway and other named

ship.","start":236.594,"stop":261.512,"duration":24.92},{"text":"The -- but by reason of it being petitioner's story only of what happened, why, the meeting wound up indeterminate.","start":261.512,"stop":273.246,"duration":11.73},{"text":"And before the end of the meeting some apparently about 10 to 15 minutes before the end of that meeting Medina left the room.","start":273.246,"stop":285.472,"duration":12.23},{"text":"It develops later then that what he did was he went and got according to the one part of the testimony, he stole the key according to

one of the passage ways on the boat Medina was there, described as being up against the wall, one of the men that passed before Thompson described it that way and then as Thompson came by he yelled out in a loud screech of voice, â€œI am going to kill you, you so and so,\" and clubbed him three times with all his might on the head with the meat cleaver.","start":311.074,"stop":338.53,"duration":27.46},{"text":"The testimony indicates that if as a manner of fact the petitioner hadn't had an extraordinarily abnormally think skull he would have

brain.","start":351.592,"stop":364.111,"duration":12.52},{"text":"It did though according to encephalograms and reports from two hospitals where encephalograms were taken produce encephalopathy due to

concussion.","start":382.057,"stop":386.288,"duration":4.23},{"text":"He was in the hospital for about something over 5 months, that is in the -- in hospitals.","start":386.288,"stop":393.58,"duration":7.29},{"text":"He was in several hospitals.","start":393.58,"stop":395.437,"duration":1.86},{"text":"He -- he was taken off the boat and put in one there in a Texas port where they landed and then sent to Houston, then sent to New Orleans and then sent to Stapleton and while he was at New Orleans he had to go back to Texas to attend the criminal trial of Medina.","start":395.437,"stop":416.411,"duration":20.97},{"text":"But on the train he was so disabled, he got sick and had to be taken off, taken to the hospital and treated there.","start":416.411,"stop":426.288,"duration":9.88},{"text":"And the trial postponed.","start":426.288,"stop":427.605,"duration":1.32},{"text":"Medina by the way was tried and convicted and sent to prison.","start":427.605,"stop":433.867,"duration":6.26},{"text":"Then after he had been in the hospital 5 or 6 months and he was discharged into a condition of out-patient then and he got $300 from the defendants to take a trip down to Arkansas where he originally came from apparently to take some salt baths, thought he would feel better and they had passed him the money and he went down there and then came back.","start":433.867,"stop":465.053,"duration":31.19},{"text":"And when he came back he went to see Mr. Mahoney the man who had advanced him the money.","start":465.053,"stop":470.302,"duration":5.25},{"text":"Incidentally he had correspondence with Mahoney.","start":470.302,"stop":473.387,"duration":3.08},{"text":"Mahoney had told him even while he -- before he arrived in New York I will be glad to see you and so forth.","start":473.387,"stop":481.679,"duration":8.29},{"text":"I mention that because respondent's counsel makes much of the fact that the man approached them to settle his case.","start":481.679,"stop":492.973,"duration":11.29},{"text":"And that he acted on his own, he insisted on acting on his own.","start":492.973,"stop":497.572,"duration":4.6},{"text":"The picture is one though of pitiful reliance as shown by the way by their own -- by the correspondence the letters that respondent themselves introduced in evidence pitiful reliance on Sealing & Jarvis, the agents for the defendant shipowner and on Mahoney.","start":497.572,"stop":518.042,"duration":20.47},{"text":"So when he got back he went to see Mahoney for discussion of settlement possible getting some money out of the case.","start":518.042,"stop":527.837,"duration":9.79},{"text":"And Mahoney had some discussion with him and then sent him to a man named Barron who was the agent for the insurance underwriter.","start":527.837,"stop":539.219,"duration":11.38},{"text":"And Mahoney told him according to petitioner's testimony that he didn't think they could pay more after -- by the way speaking to Barron, that they didn't think -- he didn't think they could pay him more than the $4000 because you're well.","start":539.219,"stop":560.124,"duration":20.9},{"text":"The -- he was sent however to Barron to have a discussion with him and he had to -- he had as a matter of fact -- this transpired before he went to Arkansas, this -- what I just mentioned.","start":560.124,"stop":574.48,"duration":14.36},{"text":"He had two conferences with Barron, was sent to Barron, Barron testifies that when he approached him he first asked for a $15,000 in settlement, but he thought he managed to talk him down to $6000 at that first conference.","start":574.48,"stop":592.852,"duration":18.37},{"text":"And then when he got back from Arkansas he paints it as a story where the petitioner was asking for $6000 and he told him then that he has already saved money if he took $4000 instead of hiring an attorney because most attorney's charge one-third of recovery and now the pitiful reliance on the one hand of his man and the abject submission off into overreaching is illustrated if by well, all through the negotiations, but also by that particular aspect of the case.","start":592.852,"stop":633.732,"duration":40.88},{"text":"Imagine a man being told that on the one hand he do better off, they're talking about a figure of $6000 now and that he'd do better off not to hire attorneys that would save attorney's fees and then whack it there because they are about a third and then whack the $6000 by the third, retain the $2000 even on that item for the defendants and gave him the $4000.","start":633.732,"stop":661.307,"duration":27.58},{"text":"He managed to convince this man that that was better for him.","start":661.307,"stop":666.483,"duration":5.18},{"text":"They also told him -- Barron told him quite specifically that in regard to the legal matter he had a very weak case.","start":666.483,"stop":676.872,"duration":10.39},{"text":"The representation there was that his right of recovery depended on proving that the shipowner company had notice of the dangerous character of Medina, when they shipped him on board.","start":676.872,"stop":693.946,"duration":17.07},{"text":"In other words the old common law rule of anyone's liability for his own negligence which was long before the Jones Act, long before any of the other modern employee's liability legislation.","start":693.946,"stop":708.847,"duration":14.9},{"text":"In fact you can find a case to that effect way back in I think about volume one or two reprint, that if a man is negligent in hiring somebody that is absolutely a danger to other people he was liable even then.","start":708.847,"stop":725.451,"duration":16.6},{"text":"But they were talking as of a time when the Jones Act was in existence for one thing and that confers a cause of action for negligence and this Court has held in two cases where it's true the one who committed the assault was somewhat a superior, one was a foremen, the stevedore and the other was boatswain on a boat.","start":725.451,"stop":751.443,"duration":25.99},{"text":"They held that where the assault was committed by them that commission of that assault was negligence under the Jones Act.","start":751.443,"stop":764.231,"duration":12.79},{"text":"The Court has never had before it denied certiorari in a case that would have presented it perhaps in the Jones case, Jones against Lykes Brothers some time ago has never had before it the application that two men of equal disposition, equal status on the boat.","start":764.231,"stop":784.481,"duration":20.25},{"text":"But the rationality of the Jones decision seems to be -- Judge Learned Hand's views in fact comparing it with some of the others seems to be that a mere fight doesn't show such a malicious disposition of a man on board as to create on the one hand unseaworthiness or to constitute negligence.","start":784.481,"stop":815.288,"duration":30.81},{"text":"Whereas the use of a meat cleaver or something like that such as was involved in the Boudoin case before Your Honor's last term, by the way there the man if I recall correctly was hit one time.","start":815.288,"stop":829.242,"duration":13.95},{"text":"But that was -- no, that wasn't a meat cleaver case that was a case of the brandy bottle.","start":829.242,"stop":834.172,"duration":4.93},{"text":"But it cited the Keen case that Judge Learned Hand had decided in the Second Circuit that did involve a meat cleaver assault.","start":834.172,"stop":842.466,"duration":8.29},{"text":"And there the meat cleaver was used for one blow, here the man was struck three times.","start":842.466,"stop":849.433,"duration":6.97},{"text":"In both those cases, both the Keen case and the Boudoin case by the way the assaulting man was drunk at the time and yet the ground of holding unseaworthiness in the case was that the man was not fit to be a member of the crew.","start":849.433,"stop":868.471,"duration":19.04},{"text":"He was -- the very happening of the assault showed conclusively that the ship was unseaworthy.","start":868.471,"stop":875.671,"duration":7.2},{"text":"Now in this case the man was perfectly sober, Medina.","start":875.671,"stop":879.155,"duration":3.48},{"text":"He was simply this kind of character that weird sort of creature that shouldn't have been on the boat in the first place and whose act in assaulting this man with a meat cleaver certainly show that it's -- if there is a Jones Act liability there is unseaworthiness liability along the line of the Boudoin case and the Keen
