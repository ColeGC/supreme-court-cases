by District Judge Noonan of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.","start":20.69,"stop":35.008,"duration":14.32},{"text":"The contempt arose out of petitioner's failure to obey a

investigation.","start":35.008,"stop":50.527,"duration":15.52},{"text":"Petitioner's refusal is based upon the ground of self-incrimination and his privilege to remain silent under the provisions of

Court.","start":59.363,"stop":65.8,"duration":6.44},{"text":"And the petitioner was punished summarily and sentenced to six months imprisonment under Rule 42 -- 42 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal

questions.","start":76.797,"stop":86.95,"duration":10.15},{"text":"The District Court held that the petitioner did not sustain the burden of establishing that the answers to the selected questions would incriminate him.","start":86.95,"stop":98.789,"duration":11.84},{"text":"The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order of District Judge Noonan and this Court granted certiorari.","start":98.789,"stop":105.917,"duration":7.13},{"text":"The questions involved upon this appeal are, first, whether it was evident from the implications of the questions and the setting

result.","start":105.917,"stop":128.064,"duration":22.15},{"text":"And the second question relates to the procedure for -- in the hearing before District Judge Noonan.","start":128.064,"stop":135.736,"duration":7.67},{"text":"The petitioner made several request for an opportunity to prepare a defense and produce

possibility of incrimination existed under the rule of Hoffman against United States.","start":161.816,"stop":184.704,"duration":22.89},{"text":"So the Government upon this appeal takes a position different from the District Court and contrary to the opinion of the Court Of Appeals.","start":184.704,"stop":197.109,"duration":12.41},{"text":"So in view of this very commendable concession, the issue presented now is a very narrow and legal one.","start":197.109,"stop":206.528,"duration":9.42},{"text":"And that is whether the custodian of the records of a union may refuse on the ground of

beginning in view of the fact that the setting becomes important in these types of case that this petitioner was secretary-treasurer of Local 269 and he was served with two subpoenas.","start":490.295,"stop":506.645,"duration":16.35},{"text":"He was served with a personal subpoena and a subpoena duces tecum.","start":506.645,"stop":511.758,"duration":5.11},{"text":"And in each subpoena, he was directed to appear and testify as to alleged violations of the federal conspiracy statute.","start":511.758,"stop":522.063,"duration":10.31},{"text":"Now, those subpoenas appear on pages 47 and 48 of the record and that fact will become significant.","start":522.063,"stop":532.557,"duration":10.49},{"text":"Now, what was the general setting?","start":532.557,"stop":536.692,"duration":4.13},{"text":"This petitioner was served with these subpoenas on April 9th for his appearance on April 10th.","start":536.692,"stop":544.245,"duration":7.55},{"text":"About a week and a half before that date, a grand jury was impaneled in New York to investigate allegations of racketeering in the garment and trucking industries.","start":544.245,"stop":555.758,"duration":11.51},{"text":"This investigation followed widespread public charges that seven local unions were recently chartered by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to gain control of the Teamsters Joint Council.","start":555.758,"stop":569.162,"duration":13.4},{"text":"It was charged that these seven locals were under the control of labor racketeers and gangsters and particularly one, Johnny DioGuardia.","start":569.162,"stop":579.298,"duration":10.14},{"text":"One Martin T. Lacey was then president of the Teamsters Joint Council had commenced a civil action to declare a certain election null and void.","start":579.298,"stop":587.834,"duration":8.54},{"text":"And in that civil action, Mr. Lacey had made this allegation of fraud.Judge Noonan, who found this petitioner guilty of contempt, had issued a temporary injunction in that action.","start":587.834,"stop":601.047,"duration":13.21},{"text":"The newspapers carry stories about the fact that Mr. Lacey conferred with one of the Assistant United States Attorneys who had questioned the petitioner before the grand jury.","start":601.047,"stop":610.857,"duration":9.81},{"text":"And these charges were dramatized in the local press, so that the setting was such that the petitioner would reasonably have feared that the -- and only was he -- to be fairly investigated but that he was to be prosecuted.","start":610.857,"stop":625.811,"duration":14.95},{"text":"Now, as we all know in a war, an army starts an attack with an artillery barrage and when such a thing happens, the opposing army knows that it was about to be attacked.","start":625.811,"stop":634.635,"duration":8.82},{"text":"Well, with this barrage of publicity, a lot of it consisting of press releases from the United States Attorney's office, this petitioner could reasonably have sensed the peril of prosecution for a wide variety of offenses.","start":634.635,"stop":649.534,"duration":14.9},{"text":"So when petitioner first appeared before the grand jury on April 10 and his lawyers were then in Albany, he refused to answer most of the questions saying, as appears on page 65 of the record, “You are throwing legal stuff at me and I don't know whether you are trapping me or not.”","start":649.534,"stop":667.76,"duration":18.23},{"text":"He was told to come back on April 12.","start":667.76,"stop":671.651,"duration":3.89},{"text":"He came back and his attorneys remained in the anteroom.","start":671.651,"stop":676.213,"duration":4.56},{"text":"He denied that he had possession of the books and records at the time he was served with these subpoenas or that he had possession for at least three days prior to the date he was served with these subpoenas.","start":676.213,"stop":690.04,"duration":13.83},{"text":"And then at page 83 of the record, incidentally, the complete transcript of the grand jury testimony appeared in the record before the Circuit Court of Appeals but was not before the District Court, it was made part of the record by consent.","start":690.04,"stop":704.604,"duration":14.56},{"text":"We didn't have a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony until after the petitioner was adjudged guilty of contempt.","start":704.604,"stop":711.704,"duration":7.1},{"text":"And we -- we wanted part of the record, so to show the connection between the -- the questions as to the whereabouts of the books and other questions.","start":711.704,"stop":718.968,"duration":7.26},{"text":"We're beginning at page 83.","start":718.968,"stop":721.275,"duration":2.31},{"text":"We have a series of questions such as these, “Did you try and get in touch with Johnny DioGuardia, who was that well-known a racketeer after he was served with subpoenas?","start":721.275,"stop":731.435,"duration":10.16},{"text":"Did you talk to him?","start":731.435,"stop":733.069,"duration":1.63},{"text":"Did he order you not to produce the books and records?","start":733.069,"stop":736.208,"duration":3.14},{"text":"Do you know John O'Rourke?","start":736.208,"stop":738.22,"duration":2.01},{"text":"When did he last see the records?”","start":738.22,"stop":740.61,"duration":2.39},{"text":"Then, the Government began a series of questions as to where the records were on certain dates.","start":740.61,"stop":747.137,"duration":6.53},{"text":"And the petitioner sensing he was being tracked, said as follows at page 85, “They are leading up to something and I do not know what to do.”","start":747.137,"stop":759.508,"duration":12.37},{"text":"And the Assistant United States Attorney again reframed the questions and asked the petitioner where the -- where the books were on various days for about two weeks prior to the time he was served with a subpoena.","start":759.508,"stop":771.555,"duration":12.05},{"text":"And the witness refused to answer those questions on the ground of his right to remain silent.","start":771.555,"stop":778.371,"duration":6.82},{"text":"And he was asked other questions about this local union who this stationary was that permit the stationary.","start":778.371,"stop":784.392,"duration":6.02},{"text":"And finally, he was told to come back on April 17.","start":784.392,"stop":789.05,"duration":4.66},{"text":"In the meantime, the total numbers of questions asked to the petitioner were about 225, most of which he refused to answer.","start":789.05,"stop":796.013,"duration":6.96},{"text":"On April 17th, the grand jury recessed and reconvened before District Judge Noonan.","start":796.013,"stop":802.209,"duration":6.2},{"text":"And at that time, the Assistant United States Attorney submitted as an exhibit only 15 of the 225 questions as the basis for this contempt.","start":802.209,"stop":815.258,"duration":13.05},{"text":"And Judge Noonan asked the petitioner how answering the questions would incriminate him.","start":815.258,"stop":820.497,"duration":5.24},{"text":"The attorney for the petitioner gave a very general explanation and referred to the charges made by Mr. Lacey in the civil litigation that was then going on upstairs.","start":820.497,"stop":830.636,"duration":10.14},{"text":"The court's rule that the privilege was improperly exercised and direct to the witness to answer the questions.","start":830.636,"stop":837.569,"duration":6.93},{"text":"The petitioner was taken again before the grand jury and he again refused to answer the questions.","start":837.569,"stop":843.466,"duration":5.9},{"text":"He was brought back before Judge Noonan two days later and as the Assistant United States Attorney stated, for the purpose of having the contempt committed in the presence of the Court so that he could be punished summarily.","start":843.466,"stop":859.592,"duration":16.13},{"text":"The petitioner was put on the stand and the Court picked out these 15 selected questions and the Court did not know of the nature of the other questions.","start":859.592,"stop":869.714,"duration":10.12},{"text":"But these were the questions carved out of the 225 questions by the Assistant United States Attorney.","start":869.714,"stop":876.166,"duration":6.45},{"text":"And the -- the witness again declined to answer those 15 selected questions as to the whereabouts of the books and records.","start":876.166,"stop":885.426,"duration":9.26},{"text":"And the Court stated that under the decision in United States against Trock, decided by the Second Circuit, the burden was upon the petitioner to satisfy the Court that the answers to the questions would incriminate him.","start":885.426,"stop":900.837,"duration":15.41},{"text":"Incidentally, this Trock decision was summarily reversed by this Court in the application for a petition for certiorari after this appeal was argued.","start":900.837,"stop":910.102,"duration":9.26},{"text":"And we made a motion for rehearing on the basis of this Court's decision.","start":910.102,"stop":913.819,"duration":3.72},{"text":"That application was denied.","start":913.819,"stop":916.164,"duration":2.35}]},{"speakerName":"Hugo L.
