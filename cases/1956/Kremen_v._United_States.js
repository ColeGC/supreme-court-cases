Court.","start":12.927,"stop":17.137,"duration":4.21},{"text":"This case is here on certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which had affirmed judgments of conviction rendered at the jury trial in the District Court in Northern District of California against the three petitioners here.","start":17.137,"stop":34.56,"duration":17.42},{"text":"The petitioners who before the Court are as the Mr. Chief Justice has just indicated, Shirley Kremen, Samuel Coleman and Sidney Steinberg.","start":34.56,"stop":42.754,"duration":8.19},{"text":"Originally, if the Court please, there were five defendants in this case.","start":42.754,"stop":46.622,"duration":3.87},{"text":"These three petitioners and two others, one Patricia Blau who was acquitted at the end of the government's case by the district judge and one Carl Ross who was found guilty, but who being unable to raise the bail that was required of him on appeal has served his sentence and so no longer a party to this proceeding.","start":46.622,"stop":67.837,"duration":21.22},{"text":"In that connection, I might say that some of these other petitioners also have served portions of this sentence because of the difficulties that they had in raising bail, but subsequently, they did raise bail and they are now out but there are still substantial portions of the sentences remaining to be served.","start":67.837,"stop":82.295,"duration":14.46},{"text":"So that no sentence in this case is moot.","start":82.295,"stop":85.086,"duration":2.79},{"text":"But petitioner Kremen was able to raise her bail initially so she still has her full sentence ahead of her.","start":85.086,"stop":90.875,"duration":5.79},{"text":"The indictment which was returned is in four counts and it charged in the first count that when Robert Thompson had been convicted of conspiracy to violate the Smith Act in New York in 1949, parenthetically, I might observed that Thompson was one of the defendants in the Dennis case which was ultimately affirmed in this Court.","start":90.875,"stop":113.549,"duration":22.67},{"text":"And that first count continued to charge that all five of those named defendants, that is three petitioners here and the two others who I mentioned, were accessories after the fact to the Smith Act conviction in 1949 in New York.","start":113.549,"stop":128.67,"duration":15.12},{"text":"It was alleged that they were accessories after the fact in 1953 in California.","start":128.67,"stop":133.549,"duration":4.88},{"text":"I might also say parenthetically here that we do not concede that count one properly stated the offense for which Thompson was convicted.","start":133.549,"stop":142.98,"duration":9.43},{"text":"I will come to that point later.","start":142.98,"stop":144.225,"duration":1.25},{"text":"That's one of the points on certiorari.","start":144.225,"stop":145.882,"duration":1.66},{"text":"Here I simply wish to summarize the indictment with the Court as a prelude to the argument.","start":145.882,"stop":151.461,"duration":5.58},{"text":"The second count of the indictment alleged that all five of those defendants, three petitioners here and the two others, conspired to violate the accessory after the fact statute.","start":151.461,"stop":161.059,"duration":9.6},{"text":"In other words, it was a conspiracy to commit the offense which was importantly described in the first count of the indictment.","start":161.059,"stop":167.774,"duration":6.72},{"text":"The third count of the indictment charged that all of the defendants except Steinberg, that is the remaining four knowing that a warrant had been issued for Steinberg's arrest, harbored and concealed him contrary to the provisions of the harboring statute.","start":167.774,"stop":183.666,"duration":15.89},{"text":"Incidentally, I might observe that the warrant for Steinberg's arrest was in the proceeding in New York which later became known as United States against Flynn which Mr. Justice Harlan sat and the case was in the Second Circuit.","start":183.666,"stop":194.895,"duration":11.23},{"text":"The certiorari was denied here, the so-called the second string Smith Act cases in New York.","start":194.895,"stop":199.725,"duration":4.83},{"text":"There was a warrant up for Steinberg.","start":199.725,"stop":202.528,"duration":2.8},{"text":"He was found to use later in California and was alleged that these people had harbored.","start":202.528,"stop":207.598,"duration":5.07},{"text":"And the fourth count, the last count of the indictment alleged that all four of these defendants conspired to harbor Steinberg.","start":207.598,"stop":213.907,"duration":6.31},{"text":"So it was a conspiracy charge to commit the subsequent offense set forth in the third count of the indictment and in that conspiracy charge, Thompson was named as a co-conspirator but not as a defendant.","start":213.907,"stop":225.668,"duration":11.76},{"text":"After the indictments were returned, various pretrial motions were made attacking their sufficiency, seeking particulars and other forms of pretrial discovery.","start":225.668,"stop":233.768,"duration":8.1},{"text":"Those motions were all denied.","start":233.768,"stop":235.853,"duration":2.09},{"text":"I think more important for the argument today that should be noted.","start":235.853,"stop":240.08,"duration":4.23},{"text":"But after the indictments were returned, motions seeking the suppression of evidence allegedly illegally obtained at the time these petitioners were arrested were also, those motions were supported by affidavit.","start":240.08,"stop":251.985,"duration":11.91},{"text":"They appear on the record.","start":251.985,"stop":253.054,"duration":1.07},{"text":"The affidavits appear in the record.","start":253.054,"stop":255.102,"duration":2.05},{"text":"Pretrial hearings were held on motion to suppress and testimony was taken.","start":255.102,"stop":259.954,"duration":4.85},{"text":"Those motions were denied.","start":259.954,"stop":261.933,"duration":1.98},{"text":"At the time the evidence which we claimed was illegally seized was tendered on the trial, motions to suppress it were renewed and objections to the evidence were made on the ground but it was illegally obtained in violation of the guarantees in the Fourth Amendment.","start":261.933,"stop":277.736,"duration":15.8},{"text":"The motions to suppress were denied and the objections were overruled.","start":277.736,"stop":283.321,"duration":5.59},{"text":"While initially while I'm on the subject of evidence, I think this should be mentioned.","start":283.321,"stop":288.13,"duration":4.81},{"text":"Much of the evidence that was received by the trial court was offered and received against an individual defendant -- the specific defendant with whom there was some apparent connection with a particular item of evidence.","start":288.13,"stop":301.209,"duration":13.08},{"text":"Before the case went to the jury, the Government moved that all of the evidence be received against all of the defendants and that motion was granted and it was that posture of the evidence that the case went to the jury.","start":301.209,"stop":314.331,"duration":13.12},{"text":"At the conclusion of the Government's case, motions of the judgment of acquittal were made and as indicated were granted only as to the

back.","start":421.365,"stop":425.124,"duration":3.76},{"text":"The questions which we presented by the writ and the writ was granted without any limitation are substantially these.","start":425.124,"stop":433.367,"duration":8.24},{"text":"Whether the search of the premises which was occupied by the petitioners at the time of the arrest and the seizure of the books, papers, documents and other evidence that was so seized there were in violation of the Fourth Amendment whether or not the introduction of the evidence so seized was in violation of the Fifth.","start":433.367,"stop":451.501,"duration":18.13},{"text":"The second point on the writ was whether or not the relevant sections of the criminal statutes involved were unconstitutionally

third question presented by the writ is whether the indictment, at least the first count of it, stated an offense and whether or not there was a variance between it and the proof whether the trial judge's charge is correct on that issue.","start":461.796,"stop":475.771,"duration":13.98},{"text":"And again, that is a matter which I would like to develop when I get to that point of the

point.","start":487.426,"stop":492.602,"duration":5.18},{"text":"That's -- that's correct, Your Honor.","start":492.602,"stop":494.995,"duration":2.39},{"text":"At the -- after the verdict's return, sentences of varying lengths were imposed upon the petitioners and the cases of two of them, Coleman and Steinberg.","start":494.995,"stop":504.641,"duration":9.65},{"text":"Those sentences were consecutive so that the Court is faced with the problem of examining the -- each of the individual counts in those cases because we don't have the situation.","start":504.641,"stop":514.87,"duration":10.23},{"text":"We have concurrent sentences and it can be sustained on one count, that's the end of it, because here we have this reversed situation.","start":514.87,"stop":521.485,"duration":6.62},{"text":"And in the case of Kremen, although the sentences were concurrent, the sentence on the first and second count of the indictment was a one year sentence.","start":521.485,"stop":531.56,"duration":10.07},{"text":"Our position which I will develop a little bit later on the argument is that at most there was an act of harboring here.","start":531.56,"stop":538.015,"duration":6.46},{"text":"The statute on the harboring count permits a maximum sentence of only six months and so we contend that despite the fact that the sentences were concurrent, there was no warrant for the one year sentence under the accessory count because all we have here we say is an act of harboring which is a misdemeanor with a six-month sentence.","start":538.015,"stop":556.437,"duration":18.42}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"I -- I should have in alert but I

Court affirmed the judgments below, the judges writing three separate opinions.","start":570.268,"stop":579.01,"duration":8.74},{"text":"Chief Judge Denman dissented and Judge Haley wrote a brief concurrence to the rather lengthy opinion of Judge Lemmon..","start":579.01,"stop":586.744,"duration":7.73},{"text":"Those opinions of course are printed in the record and they also for the convenience of the Court are printed as an appendix to our petition for certiorari as it is required by the rule.","start":586.744,"stop":598.131,"duration":11.39},{"text":"I've already stated to the Court what the questions are that are presented by the petition to certiorari and which are before the Court today.","start":598.131,"stop":607.905,"duration":9.77},{"text":"Now before discussing the legal principles involved, I think I should turn briefly to the facts that we believe are relevant to the search and seizure.","start":607.905,"stop":614.715,"duration":6.81},{"text":"I separate my discussion of the facts because I believe the law to be that the Court may only consider when it is concerned with the search and seizure point and the arrest point which we raised in a manner I indicated to Mr. Justice Harlan.","start":614.715,"stop":630.956,"duration":16.24},{"text":"The Court may only consider the evidence that the officers knew at that time, an evidence which was subsequently developed, of course is not relevant on the question of validity of the arrest of the search and seizure.","start":630.956,"stop":640.945,"duration":9.99},{"text":"So the evidence which was known as far it's revealed by this record, at the time that the arrest and the search and seizure took place was this, that four of these original defendants, three petitioners who were here and Ross were arrested shortly after 1 o'clock in the afternoon of August 27th, 1953 at a cabin or a house in Twain Harte, California.","start":640.945,"stop":664.448,"duration":23.5},{"text":"Twain Harte is a small summer resort town near Sonora, California and the Mother Lode country in the foothills of the Sierras.","start":664.448,"stop":671.567,"duration":7.12},{"text":"At the time that those four were arrested, there was also present on the premises, Robert Thompson, a defendant from the Dennis case.","start":671.567,"stop":679.795,"duration":8.23},{"text":"Patricia Blau, the other defendant was arrested later in the day at a different place apparently arrested from some leads that the government agents obtained when they went through the -- premises of Twain Harte.","start":679.795,"stop":690.204,"duration":10.41},{"text":"The fact that she was arrested later I think is enough for us to -- to pass over her arrest because certainly nothing that the officers learned when they arrested her five or six or seven hours later but retrospectively so to speak, justify the arrest at 1 o'clock in the afternoon so we have to go back to that situation I think.","start":690.204,"stop":707.013,"duration":16.81},{"text":"Now, this record reveals and I think it's undisputed that for some period of time prior to these actual arrests, these agents had the petitioners under some substantial surveillance and that they're very carefully prepared these arrests.","start":707.013,"stop":719.534,"duration":12.52},{"text":"The record shows that agents who had their headquarters in New York City had arrived in San Francisco at least two days before the arrests to participate in it.","start":719.534,"stop":728.042,"duration":8.51},{"text":"And other agents from the San Francisco area had gone up to Twain Harte at least two days before the arrest or participate in the arrests.","start":728.042,"stop":735.124,"duration":7.08},{"text":"Now one of them had actually gone to the premises the day before with an employee of Pacific Gas and Electric Company.","start":735.124,"stop":743.934,"duration":8.81},{"text":"The agents sat on the truck while the employee went on the premises on a pretext in inspecting a light meter or gas meter or something in the agents premises.","start":743.934,"stop":752.05,"duration":8.12},{"text":"Also, when they came out the next day they brought with them a (Inaudible) apparently aware of the fact that there was a female on the premises and they were going to arrest her.","start":752.05,"stop":760.739,"duration":8.69},{"text":"Now, how much longer than the two or three days that the record reveals, the agents were actually engaged in preparing for this arrest, or how much longer they had these petitioners under surveillance is not revealed by the record for the reasons that although we sought this information both on the motions to suppress on the trial itself, the trial judge precluded us by his rulings to sustain government objections by finding it out.","start":760.739,"stop":783.382,"duration":22.64},{"text":"And he wouldn't let us go beyond the point when the agents left their headquarters to proceed.","start":783.382,"stop":788.906,"duration":5.52},{"text":"How much else there was?","start":788.906,"stop":790.477,"duration":1.57},{"text":"We do not know.","start":790.477,"stop":791.21,"duration":0.73},{"text":"But we do know this that the arrests were carefully prepared.","start":791.21,"stop":796.773,"duration":5.56},{"text":"A continued surveillance was maintained for at least eight hours prior to the time of the actual arrest.","start":796.773,"stop":802.077,"duration":5.3},{"text":"Agents were stationed around the cabin.","start":802.077,"stop":804.552,"duration":2.48},{"text":"They maintained an elaborate communication system with their headquarters and walkie-talkie setup so they could report to their headquarters what was going on.","start":804.552,"stop":812.686,"duration":8.13},{"text":"It's interesting to note that all the reports they made indicated nothing but normal activities that one would expect in a -- in a summer resort area.","start":812.686,"stop":821.389,"duration":8.7},{"text":"Thompson was seen to come out practicing fly cast.","start":821.389,"stop":824.436,"duration":3.05},{"text":"Other people were walking round the premises.","start":824.436,"stop":826.137,"duration":1.7},{"text":"Somebody was sitting down at the table outside the building and probably drawing or writing and Mrs. Kremen came out in the middle of the morning apparently and hang up some laundry.","start":826.137,"stop":836.614,"duration":10.48},{"text":"By noon of that day according to the agents, they satisfied themselves with two of the people that they have under observation were Thompson and Steinberg.","start":836.614,"stop":845.961,"duration":9.35},{"text":"They said they have some difficulty at first because there were -- there was substantial change in appearances.","start":845.961,"stop":851.114,"duration":5.15},{"text":"Thompson didn't look like he had look when he was in New York a couple of years earlier when they had known him.","start":851.114,"stop":855.083,"duration":3.97},{"text":"Steinberg had to put on some weight, but they satisfied themselves that these were the men that they were looking for.","start":855.083,"stop":861.097,"duration":6.01},{"text":"They relayed this information to their superiors and were told to standby to assist a raiding party and that was their own characterization of what it was, a raiding party that would come up in effect the arrest.","start":861.097,"stop":872.392,"duration":11.3},{"text":"And about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, something like 15 agents with the matrons swoop down on the cabin.","start":872.392,"stop":879.538,"duration":7.15},{"text":"And at that moment, Thompson and Steinberg were outside the cabin about 40 or 50 feet away from them.","start":879.538,"stop":885.262,"duration":5.72},{"text":"They were immediately taken into custody and they were advised that they were being arrested for the Smith Act violations on the outstanding process.","start":885.262,"stop":891.884,"duration":6.62},{"text":"There was no show of resistance by them.","start":891.884,"stop":893.618,"duration":1.73},{"text":"No attempt to

agents were sent to the cabin and ordered them out.","start":905.892,"stop":908.632,"duration":2.74},{"text":"At this point, I should like to say this that in the briefs, both sides, the Government and us have assumed that the arrests of those three, Ross, Kremen and Coleman took place inside the cabin.","start":908.632,"stop":921.06,"duration":12.43},{"text":"However, a more careful reading of the record I think convinces me that I was in error in making that assumption in the brief.","start":921.06,"stop":927.025,"duration":5.97},{"text":"And I think the record doesn't justify an assumption that those three were arrested inside the cabin.","start":927.025,"stop":931.876,"duration":4.85},{"text":"I don't want to labor this point because our case doesn't turn on it of course,
