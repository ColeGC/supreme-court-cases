subsections.","start":423.284,"stop":445.146,"duration":21.86},{"text":"But the traditional, the classic form of bank robbery is covered in (a), (b) and (d) of the

revealing.","start":491.295,"stop":494.281,"duration":2.99},{"text":"The 1934 Act only included robbery by force and violence and then if it was committed under aggravated circumstances, a -- an

intention to increase the penalties under the Ac, now, was there any intention to redefine burglary far beyond any concept that I know in the state courts or any concept known in the federal courts.","start":606.87,"stop":621.987,"duration":15.12},{"text":"Now, for some reason, the courts, some of the courts below, there are just a few of them that have interpreted the statute, have felt that peaceful entry is burglary and that this particular part of the statute means that peaceful entry is prohibited.","start":621.987,"stop":641.063,"duration":19.08},{"text":"If the necessary animus is present, even though a person may abandon his intent, he is still committed the crime.","start":641.063,"stop":649.725,"duration":8.66},{"text":"He is a felon, even though the act itself has no -- no intention whatsoever of that purpose.","start":649.725,"stop":656.342,"duration":6.62},{"text":"Now, burglary, we all know is a very serious crime, particularly the old classic form of burglary in the nighttime with -- of dwelling house with occupants.","start":656.342,"stop":666.77,"duration":10.43},{"text":"But our modern versions have redefined burglary, so that now, today, burglary may be

involved.","start":678.018,"stop":681.453,"duration":3.43},{"text":"In my home state of Kansas, there are four degrees of burglary, but the least of the degrees, the fourth degree, is far more serious

after Section 190 of the Penal Code.","start":695.468,"stop":700.231,"duration":4.76},{"text":"What does that section say?","start":700.231,"stop":701.935,"duration":1.7},{"text":"Breaking and entering a Post Office with the intent to commit a felony therein, breaking and entering.","start":701.935,"stop":708.507,"duration":6.57},{"text":"We submit that if this Court feels that this statute covers peaceful entry, even though the legislature meant burglary and larceny and clearly pass the Act to cover that and the Attorney General requested that, we'll be going far beyond the ordinary concepts of burglary.","start":708.507,"stop":726.349,"duration":17.84},{"text":"Now, the penalty is 20 years according to the statute.","start":726.349,"stop":731.102,"duration":4.75},{"text":"Now, that's in line with the regular burglary of penalties in most of the States.","start":731.102,"stop":736.553,"duration":5.45},{"text":"The most serious form of burglary, however, first degree of burglary is usually 20 years, maybe 25.","start":736.553,"stop":741.915,"duration":5.36},{"text":"My state is 20.","start":741.915,"stop":743.683,"duration":1.77},{"text":"But fourth degree is one of five in my state.","start":743.683,"stop":746.394,"duration":2.71},{"text":"It has a more serious crime than walking the bank, in 20 years, can be had in this particular instance.","start":746.394,"stop":752.375,"duration":5.98},{"text":"Furthermore, burglary is considered under this statute.","start":752.375,"stop":755.207,"duration":2.83},{"text":"Entry is more
