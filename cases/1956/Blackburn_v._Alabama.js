petitioner in this case, Jesse Blackburn.","start":21.192,"stop":25.398,"duration":4.21},{"text":"Jesse Blackburn was convicted of the crime of robbery in the State of Alabama.","start":25.398,"stop":32.569,"duration":7.17},{"text":"The crime for which he was convicted was a brutal one.","start":32.569,"stop":36.254,"duration":3.68},{"text":"It involved the armed assault and serious injury to the operator of a rolling country store in the rural county of Colbert County.","start":36.254,"stop":49.92,"duration":13.67},{"text":"It was the contention of Jesse Blackburn in his trial and it has been throughout the appellate procedures in Alabama that his conviction rested on a confession of it -- the admission of a confession into evidence was improper that the confession was involuntary.","start":49.92,"stop":70.988,"duration":21.07},{"text":"And in our petition for certiorari, we had the consideration of that question by this Court whether the confession in that case was involuntary and therefore violated the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.","start":70.988,"stop":84.715,"duration":13.73},{"text":"The facts -- the immediate facts surrounding the confession of Jesse Blackburn all came from the Deputy Sheriff who took that confession.","start":84.715,"stop":95.175,"duration":10.46},{"text":"This was true because Jesse Blackburn testified in the trial and stated that he had no recollection whatsoever of the circumstances surrounding that confession.","start":95.175,"stop":107.135,"duration":11.96},{"text":"In fact, he testified that he had no recollection of anything that had occurred for several months prior to his confession and for several months thereafter.","start":107.135,"stop":117.29,"duration":10.16},{"text":"This was not an inconsistent statement for Jesse Blackburn to make because his medical records in -- from Government insane hospital showed that recurrently Jesse Blackburn suffered from complete amnesia for long periods of time.","start":117.29,"stop":135.065,"duration":17.77},{"text":"So then again, as to the immediate facts surrounding that confession, we take it entirely from the testimony of the Deputy Sheriff who obtained the confession.","start":135.065,"stop":144.697,"duration":9.63},{"text":"His testimony showed that shortly sometime after Jesse Blackburn's arrest, he was confined to jail in Colbert County and was taken into a small room there in the jail, which he described as a room four feet by six feet or six feet by eight feet.","start":144.697,"stop":166.408,"duration":21.71},{"text":"We call it a table size room and he was interrogated there by the -- this Deputy Sheriff and two other police officers whom he said came in and out for some nine or 10 hours.","start":166.408,"stop":182.895,"duration":16.49},{"text":"The testimony of the Deputy was that they did knock off the questioning for about an hour while they had supper.","start":182.895,"stop":190.686,"duration":7.79},{"text":"And after supper, the -- the questioning continued until 10 or 11 o'clock at night.","start":190.686,"stop":198.12,"duration":7.43},{"text":"In its brief filed in this Court, the State of Alabama has suggested that the only person that questioned Jesse during all this period of time was this Deputy Sheriff Stanford.","start":198.12,"stop":209.792,"duration":11.67},{"text":"The record itself discloses, however, that the Deputy Sheriff stated that there were these other law enforcement officers who were coming in and out and that in answer to a question as to whether any of these law enforcement officers asked questions, he said they might have asked some questions and then the question was asked, did these questions relate to the facts in this case and his answer was yes.","start":209.792,"stop":240.808,"duration":31.02},{"text":"So we think here that without any real question, we have a situation where this man was questioned almost unceasingly for nine or 10 hours by relays of law enforcement officers in this table sized room in this jail down in Colbert County.","start":240.808,"stop":261.101,"duration":20.29},{"text":"We think such a confession, even if Jesse Blackburn had been a person of normal will and mind, would raise substantial doubts as to whether it would square with the constitutional requirements of due process of law.","start":261.101,"stop":276.843,"duration":15.74},{"text":"But in this case we don't have a person who was of sound mind or sound will.","start":276.843,"stop":285.266,"duration":8.42},{"text":"Jesse Blackburn was a young Negro, 25 years old when this alleged crime was committed.","start":285.266,"stop":292.022,"duration":6.76},{"text":"He had been in the Armed Services during World War II.","start":292.022,"stop":295.792,"duration":3.77},{"text":"And in 1944, he was discharged from the Army as permanently mentally defective.","start":295.792,"stop":305.24,"duration":9.45},{"text":"The Army Medical Board that surveyed him out of the Army, recommended that he be transferred to a government insane institution, and he went from the Army to a government insane institution.","start":305.24,"stop":320.811,"duration":15.57},{"text":"The diagnosis at that time for Jesse Blackburn was that he was a victim of dementia praecox which in other places they call schizophrenia, simple type, that he had a history of hallucinations and defective judgment and insight.","start":320.811,"stop":336.73,"duration":15.92},{"text":"And Jesse Blackburn remained in this government insane institution from 1944 until sometime in 1948.","start":336.73,"stop":348.723,"duration":11.99},{"text":"In November 1946, the medical -- the government hospital rated Jesse Blackburn 100% mentally incompetent.","start":348.723,"stop":360.346,"duration":11.62},{"text":"In February of 1948, he was released into the custody of his sister for a 10-day leave from the insane hospital.","start":360.346,"stop":372.123,"duration":11.78},{"text":"When the 10 days was up, Jesse didn't return to the hospital.","start":372.123,"stop":378.077,"duration":5.95},{"text":"Instead a short time thereafter, he left his home in Chicago and came to Alabama to attend the funeral of his brother.","start":378.077,"stop":391.551,"duration":13.47},{"text":"It was -- while he was on this trip to Alabama, that the crime for which he was convicted was committed.","start":391.551,"stop":401.21,"duration":9.66},{"text":"His medical records at this government insane hospital state, however, and they automatically discharged Jesse when he didn't return after 90 days.","start":401.21,"stop":410.912,"duration":9.7},{"text":"His medical record stated that on his discharge \"the diagnosis of schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type, remains unchanged.\"","start":410.912,"stop":422.459,"duration":11.55},{"text":"And he was considered incompetent at the time of his release.","start":422.459,"stop":429.076,"duration":6.62},{"text":"Now, we think it's significant in this case that this issue of insanity was not first raised by petitioner's counsel.","start":429.076,"stop":440.085,"duration":11.01},{"text":"It was raised by the very persons who obtained the confession from him.","start":440.085,"stop":446.79,"duration":6.71},{"text":"It was raised by the jailer and the Deputy Sheriff, and the Sheriff who watched him there in the jail.","start":446.79,"stop":453.502,"duration":6.71},{"text":"They testified that a short time or some little time or we don't know exactly the period, but it couldn't have been more than a few days or very few weeks.","start":453.502,"stop":463.48,"duration":9.98},{"text":"They communicated to the Circuit Judge in Colbert County that Jesse showed signs of insanity.","start":463.48,"stop":470.817,"duration":7.34},{"text":"And the Circuit Judge called in certain lay persons in the community and three local doctors to examine Jesse Blackburn.","start":470.817,"stop":480.797,"duration":9.98},{"text":"All of the persons who examined him apparently found reasonable grounds for believing him insane.","start":480.797,"stop":488.565,"duration":7.77},{"text":"The two doctors, there's a statement from them in the record, they weren't psychiatrist, they were just medical doctors.","start":488.565,"stop":495.983,"duration":7.42},{"text":"They stated that in their judgment Jesse Blackburn was not mentally able to stand trial at that time.","start":495.983,"stop":503.327,"duration":7.34},{"text":"On receiving these communications, the Circuit Judge, pursuant to the statute of Alabama, had Jesse transferred to the State Insane Hospital and a sanity commission was appointed which had as its head, the Superintendent of the State Mental Hospitals in Alabama, Dr. Tarwater.","start":503.327,"stop":524.381,"duration":21.05},{"text":"Dr. Tarwater pointed the other two members of this sanity commission that examined Jesse Blackburn.","start":524.381,"stop":530.776,"duration":6.39},{"text":"After their examination and they kept Jesse Blackburn in -- under observation for some months before rendering a report, they were unanimous in their conclusion that Jesse Blackburn was insane when he was examined by the sanity commission, that in their judgment he was insane when the alleged crime was committed and in their judgement, he was insane when his confession was received.","start":530.776,"stop":564.683,"duration":33.91},{"text":"The respondent in its brief has suggested that there's a conflict in the testimony of the three doctors on that commission in their depositions.","start":564.683,"stop":575.533,"duration":10.85},{"text":"He find such conflict from the statement of one of the doctors, Dr. Richards, that in his judgment, Jesse Blackburn did not show -- was at all times normal.","start":575.533,"stop":591.393,"duration":15.86},{"text":"And that is the statement of Dr. Richards, that in his judgement, Jesse Blackburn was at all times normal.","start":591.393,"stop":599.006,"duration":7.61},{"text":"On the same deposition, however, Dr. Richards stated -- reaffirmed the position he'd taken in his report that Jesse Blackburn was insane when he first examined him, was insane when the crime was committed.","start":599.006,"stop":616.519,"duration":17.51},{"text":"And I think the only logical way to square Dr. Richards' testimony not with the testimony of the other doctors, but with his other testimony on that deposition was that he viewed Jesse Blackburn's normal condition as that of insane.","start":616.519,"stop":632.802,"duration":16.28},{"text":"This is strengthened when it is also noted that Dr. Richards was asked, does -- did you ever observe Jesse Blackburn when he was having a lucid interval?","start":632.802,"stop":644.339,"duration":11.54},{"text":"And he said that in his judgment Jesse Blackburn had no lucid intervals.","start":644.339,"stop":653.351,"duration":9.01},{"text":"Respondent makes a further effort to minimize the report of the sanity commission by suggesting that Dr. Rowe, one of the other doctors that examined him, conceded that he didn't see him too often or words to that effect that he saw him on his general rounds.","start":653.351,"stop":671.934,"duration":18.58},{"text":"But what Dr. Rowe said was, and I'm quoting that he had petitioner “continuously under observation from the time of his admission to the hospital until his discharge.”","start":671.934,"stop":686.493,"duration":14.56},{"text":"He stated that on many occasions, he interviewed Jesse Blackburn for quite sometime, for interviews that lasted more than an hour in duration and in on other times, he just saw him on his general ward rounds.","start":686.493,"stop":699.6,"duration":13.11},{"text":"On the basis of this lunacy commission's report, Jesse Blackburn was committed to the insane hospitals in Alabama and he remained on an insane institution from July 1948 until November 1952.","start":699.6,"stop":719.997,"duration":20.4},{"text":"He was actually in the insane hospital for more than four years being treated for his insanity.","start":719.997,"stop":727.93,"duration":7.93},{"text":"That was under an order of the Circuit Court of Colbert County which directed that he be turned over to the insane hospital “permanently\" or until restored to sanity.","start":727.93,"stop":745.492,"duration":17.56},{"text":"In 1952, the sanity commission reported back to the Court that at that time, Jesse appeared to be restored to sanity.","start":745.492,"stop":759.625,"duration":14.13},{"text":"And then he was brought back and put to trial.","start":759.625,"stop":766.431,"duration":6.81},{"text":"Now, the State of Alabama recognized the time honored rule that you don't try insane people.","start":766.431,"stop":773.385,"duration":6.95},{"text":"And for that reason, they put Jesse Blackburn where he belong in an insane institution for some four-and-a-half years.","start":773.385,"stop":782.09,"duration":8.71},{"text":"But when they said he was restored to sanity, they sent him back to trial and convicted him on a confession, which in the opinion of all the medical evidence in the case, was obtained at a time when he was insane.","start":782.09,"stop":802.064,"duration":19.97}]},{"speakerName":"Harold Burton","textObjs":[{"text":"Did the jury pass on
