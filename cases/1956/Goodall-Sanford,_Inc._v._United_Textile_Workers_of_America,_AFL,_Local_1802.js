uncertain.","start":66.659,"stop":86.597,"duration":19.94},{"text":"There is one thing that is clear and that is that the objective of Section 301 was to ensure that where you had contracts which had

policing the enforcement of the contract that where you had that kind of a cause, there should not be strikes and legal remedy should be provided to ensure that there would be labor peace during the

taken.","start":214.601,"stop":219.544,"duration":4.94},{"text":"It says that -- that “If these contracts are not enforceable, you will not \"promote industrial

difficulty was only procedural.","start":238.116,"stop":247.055,"duration":8.94},{"text":"Really, the -- the principal difficulty in suing unions was not procedural as it is illustrated in the New

them.","start":247.055,"stop":261.954,"duration":14.9},{"text":"But the substantive law of the State that since these organizations are not legal entities, all you get when you sue a union in its

union per se is not a legal person.","start":261.954,"stop":285.79,"duration":23.84},{"text":"In other words, they have construed their suit statute as a procedural suit, statute only not changing the substantive rule of liability with the respect to one incorporated associations.","start":285.79,"stop":298.631,"duration":12.84},{"text":"They discussed all of these difficulties, difficulties in the

as a valid binding and enforceable contract is a logical and necessary step.","start":345.449,"stop":356.816,"duration":11.37},{"text":"It will promote a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements and will thereby promote industrial peace.","start":356.816,"stop":365.797,"duration":8.98},{"text":"Now, they were talking about no-strike clause, the no-strike arbitration provision which are really the same clause.","start":365.797,"stop":373.329,"duration":7.53},{"text":"Because their next goal to meet the objection that if they do this, unions won't agree to no-strike arbitration clauses anymore.","start":373.329,"stop":383.82,"duration":10.49},{"text":"If unions are responsible in damages and these suits can be brought and there is this statutory recognition of these contracts as enforceable contracts.","start":383.82,"stop":393.743,"duration":9.92},{"text":"But they answered that by saying, “This argument isn't supported, in the few States

California, have enacted those laws.”","start":404.135,"stop":409.412,"duration":5.28},{"text":"And as far as they can determine, there has been no decrease in the incidence of no-strike clauses in union contracts.","start":409.412,"stop":417.084,"duration":7.67},{"text":"And therefore, they conclude that there would not be any decrease in the incidence of union of no-strike clauses if Congress gave the statutory recognition.","start":417.084,"stop":430.101,"duration":13.02},{"text":"Now, concededly, the question of whether an agreement to arbitrate can be specifically enforced was not
