guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, petitioner has been sentenced to death for the crime of burglary in the first degree, it being in the first degree, because he allegedly committed with intent to rape.","start":33.206,"stop":57.076,"duration":23.87},{"text":"The issues in the case are principally two.","start":57.076,"stop":61.724,"duration":4.65},{"text":"The first issue revolves about the admissibility of a confession or confessions which the petitioner alleges were coerced from him in violation of guarantees conferred by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.","start":61.724,"stop":79.508,"duration":17.78},{"text":"Related to this principle issue of the confession is another issue.","start":79.508,"stop":87.906,"duration":8.4},{"text":"While the confession was in the process of being qualified to be admitted into evidence as voluntary, the petitioner offered to take the stand to testify concerning the voluntary nature of the confession and to testify towards that purpose only.","start":87.906,"stop":104.19,"duration":16.28},{"text":"The State’s Attorney objected stating that if the petitioner were to take the stand, he should then have to testify not only as to voluntariness but -- but as to -- as he said, each and every matter in evidence.","start":104.19,"stop":116.825,"duration":12.64},{"text":"Petitioner claims that the requirement to put him on the stand and require him to testify as to matters as to which he would otherwise be privileged to remain silent, prevented him from establishing the involuntary nature of the confession and consequently was also erroneous.","start":116.825,"stop":133.606,"duration":16.78},{"text":"In addition to this, there is also the issue of whether Negroes were excluded from juries

on suspicion, and they did not as is required by Alabama law for the extraordinary case of a civilian arrest, they did not take him before a magistrate and indeed, this is not only required by the Alabama law, but this is the custom, the record shows, of the City of Selma when a man is arrested within the city.","start":138.04,"stop":164.35,"duration":26.31},{"text":"There are some evidence
