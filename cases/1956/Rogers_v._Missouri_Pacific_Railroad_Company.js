Rogers, while in the employ of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company at Garner, Arkansas on July 17th, 1951.","start":30.732,"stop":53.79,"duration":23.06},{"text":"It was brought under the terms and provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act on this -- in the pleadings.","start":53.79,"stop":60.58,"duration":6.79},{"text":"Both parties conceded that the plaintiff and the defendant that lower courts level were subject to the provisions of that Act.","start":60.58,"stop":71.375,"duration":10.8},{"text":"The plaintiff, the petitioner here, proceeded to trial on April 12th, 1954, and for three days following that, recovered a judgment by the Court and the jury in a sum of $40,000.","start":71.375,"stop":89.09,"duration":17.72},{"text":"And after judgment have been entered, the defendant in that case, the respondent here, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court, which reversed the judgment outright holding that the petitioner had not made a submissible case.","start":89.09,"stop":109.597,"duration":20.51},{"text":"Thereafter, this Court granted certiorari, bringing us here because of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri was final as of that time.","start":109.597,"stop":123.178,"duration":13.58},{"text":"We contend the petitioner that the ruling of the state court was wrong, not only because it was in the teeth of the decisions of this Court, but because it based its decision on facts that were not warranted inferences and facts not warranted either by the evidence, the submission of the case or the instructions granted by the Court.","start":123.178,"stop":150.058,"duration":26.88},{"text":"The whole answer to the case will have to be found in the facts, and while they are somewhat extensive, they are simple in their very nature, and I will as quickly as I can, with the chronicle -- chronological order, attempt to give Your Honors a review of those facts.","start":150.058,"stop":169.701,"duration":19.64},{"text":"In this particular case, the plaintiff, petitioner was 24 years of age at the time of his injury on July 17th, 1951.","start":169.701,"stop":181.135,"duration":11.43},{"text":"He'd been employed by the Railroad Company some six or seven weeks prior to that particular injury.","start":181.135,"stop":188.08,"duration":6.95},{"text":"At the time they were working at Garner, Arkansas on a roadbed and track that ran in general direction, north and south, the north bound track or the east track was for the north bound trains and the west track would be necessarily for the south bound trains.","start":188.08,"stop":207.351,"duration":19.27},{"text":"There were only two tracks.","start":207.351,"stop":209.198,"duration":1.85},{"text":"They cover the space when laid down on the ties and the ballast in between the ties are some 15 or 20 feet, which might be referred to as the roadbed.","start":209.198,"stop":224.212,"duration":15.01},{"text":"The work the petitioner was doing was the burning of weeds along the western side of this north and south track.","start":224.212,"stop":234.136,"duration":9.92},{"text":"These weeds have been prepared for burning previously by having then sprayed by chemical the purpose of which was indeed cause the weeds to dry and to be ready to immediate ignition when they're torched or some force of that kind was applied.","start":234.136,"stop":256.401,"duration":22.27},{"text":"A particular torch that he was given to do this work was a rather improvised quart can of oil.","start":256.401,"stop":263.856,"duration":7.45},{"text":"It had two spouts, one on either side coming out on a 45-degree angle in one of which spouts rags serving as a wick.","start":263.856,"stop":274.762,"duration":10.91},{"text":"They were -- were placed and on the other spout of this 45-degree angle was inserted a stick or handle about three feet long.","start":274.762,"stop":284.297,"duration":9.54},{"text":"The particular place of work which becomes important here was about 250 to 300 yards north of what is called the Garner Crossing.","start":284.297,"stop":297.698,"duration":13.4},{"text":"And the work intended was to burn these weeds which for the most part were to the west of the petitioner as he would work from south to north.","start":297.698,"stop":310.982,"duration":13.28},{"text":"In other words, he would be working on the west shoulder of this right of way.","start":310.982,"stop":316.315,"duration":5.33},{"text":"The shoulder itself was defined as being a space beginning with the western edge of the ties and extending to the west about three to three and a half feet.","start":316.315,"stop":327.397,"duration":11.08},{"text":"And if we look further to the west, we go down to his left as he goes north or to his west side as to what is called a dump, which is lower than the roadbed, which is up above it.","start":327.397,"stop":340.271,"duration":12.87},{"text":"Now, the weeds were about two and a half to three feet in width to the west of his shoulder and extending in part down into the dump.","start":340.271,"stop":350.483,"duration":10.21},{"text":"He would take this ignited torch and apply it to these specially prepared weeds for burning.","start":350.483,"stop":360.412,"duration":9.93},{"text":"On this particular case on how he succeeded with that job and how he'd gone along without any difficulty, he would have gone up to the culvert which is in question here.","start":360.412,"stop":374.359,"duration":13.95},{"text":"In that culvert, it was 253 yards north of the Garner Crossing where he started all of his work.","start":374.359,"stop":381.232,"duration":6.87},{"text":"He remembers on the west side.","start":381.232,"stop":383.737,"duration":2.5},{"text":"And after getting to the crossing, he would then have gone.","start":383.737,"stop":386.876,"duration":3.14},{"text":"He didn't get there, but he would have been have gone 200 yards further to the north on the west side at which time he would then cross over to the east side to do his further work.","start":386.876,"stop":397.567,"duration":10.69},{"text":"I mentioned that because in addition to the job of burning the weeds, he was a section man and the defendant through its foreman imposed on him and the others the duty of watching for the trains whenever they went by for hotboxes.","start":397.567,"stop":419.384,"duration":21.82},{"text":"Apparently, that was a paramount consideration because the foreman told him that -- and told all of them, “When a train goes by, drop everything.","start":419.384,"stop":431.57,"duration":12.19},{"text":"Put down everything and watch the train for hotboxes.”","start":431.57,"stop":435.709,"duration":4.14},{"text":"And the foreman went further and said that the crew should divide their works so that some would be on the east side and some on the west side so that necessarily, they can watch as the train went by the hotboxes on the west side, which would be equally important with the hotboxes if any on the east side.","start":435.709,"stop":455.584,"duration":19.88},{"text":"It so happens and the record show this fact that at the time of plaintiff's injury, the petitioner's injury he alone was on the east side.","start":455.584,"stop":466.163,"duration":10.58},{"text":"Every other member of the crew was on the -- he alone was on the west side, I beg your pardon.","start":466.163,"stop":472.347,"duration":6.18},{"text":"Every other member of the crew was on the east side so that -- and he had nothing to do with assigning those other men to that position.","start":472.347,"stop":481.208,"duration":8.86},{"text":"He was merely assigned to do this work himself, but he was explicitly told to watch that train for hotboxes.","start":481.208,"stop":489.38,"duration":8.17},{"text":"So, he goes along with his torch and he sets fire to the weeds on the west side and was told to stand on the west shoulder, to stay along the west shoulder.","start":489.38,"stop":500.248,"duration":10.87},{"text":"He was told not to cross or attempt to cross to the east in front of the oncoming train which of course would be hazardous in and of itself.","start":500.248,"stop":509.356,"duration":9.11},{"text":"But he was particularly advised not to cross because the -- the noise of the oncoming train would deafen the sound of another oncoming train, if one would come from the opposite direction, so that he couldn't cross to the east.","start":509.356,"stop":524.415,"duration":15.06},{"text":"He couldn't cross to the west because that's where he was burning.","start":524.415,"stop":527.643,"duration":3.23},{"text":"He was burning to the left of it and the west on the shoulder and the -- down into to the dump.","start":527.643,"stop":533.395,"duration":5.75},{"text":"He couldn't go back to the south.","start":533.395,"stop":535.154,"duration":1.76},{"text":"That's the direction he was working from, from south to north.","start":535.154,"stop":538.668,"duration":3.51},{"text":"The only avenue of escape from the fire once it was started would be to the north.","start":538.668,"stop":544.624,"duration":5.96},{"text":"And so, he goes along with his work and the understanding was that when a train was coming before a gap to the crossing, the foreman would yell “train” and would usually yell in the south bound or north bound.","start":544.624,"stop":559.964,"duration":15.34},{"text":"But in this particular instance, it is not of great significance, but it is in -- a fact nevertheless, that the foreman did not yell “Train!”","start":559.964,"stop":569.714,"duration":9.75},{"text":"He didn't give the customary notice.","start":569.714,"stop":572.225,"duration":2.51},{"text":"It would only be important in showing how the time was consumed.","start":572.225,"stop":575.824,"duration":3.6},{"text":"He didn't give him that notice.","start":575.824,"stop":577.594,"duration":1.77},{"text":"And the first that the petitioner knew that a train was coming was when he heard the whistle at the crossing, some 200 yards away from him.","start":577.594,"stop":585.794,"duration":8.2},{"text":"Mindful of the admonition that had theretofore been given him to watch the train, he started running away from the fire which had been set to the north and he ran as far as the culvert, which was 30 to 35 yards from the point where he was last working when he heard the train.","start":585.794,"stop":606.732,"duration":20.94},{"text":"When he gets to the culvert, by that time, the train has overtaken him and the engine has already passed him by.","start":606.732,"stop":614.437,"duration":7.71},{"text":"Now, the engine is on the north bound track so that its engine on the -- because its pulling on the north bound track.","start":614.437,"stop":621.963,"duration":7.53},{"text":"It is 15 to 20 feet east of it.","start":621.963,"stop":624.956,"duration":2.99},{"text":"He sets his torch down at that point, turns to the east so it's the -- watched the hotboxes and when three or four cars going at the rate of 35 to 40 -- 30 to 35 miles an hour, which would be at the rate mathematically of 51 to 59 feet a second.","start":624.956,"stop":646.638,"duration":21.68},{"text":"That's purely mathematics.","start":646.638,"stop":648.77,"duration":2.13},{"text":"In that 51 to 59 feet, it's like three cars go by him.","start":648.77,"stop":653.431,"duration":4.66},{"text":"And by that time, he feels the heat of the blaze on his face.","start":653.431,"stop":659.309,"duration":5.88},{"text":"As he carries his hip, it seems his eyebrows are seamed.","start":659.309,"stop":664.593,"duration":5.28},{"text":"He throws his left hand over his eyes and quickly backs up six or eight feet.","start":664.593,"stop":670.456,"duration":5.86},{"text":"And when he backs up at least six or eight feet, he has caused to fall down the embankment and suffers injury because that particular portion of the culvert onto which he backed was sloping and had loose gravel on it which he says was never permitted ordinarily to be there.","start":670.456,"stop":687.633,"duration":17.18},{"text":"That was kept flat and leveled so that such a man would have a safe place to walk.","start":687.633,"stop":693.114,"duration":5.48},{"text":"Now, he didn't know the sloping gravel was there, as a matter of fact, because when he -- the only time he was ever up at that culvert.","start":693.114,"stop":700.269,"duration":7.15},{"text":"This was the first day he had ever done that job in his life.","start":700.269,"stop":703.902,"duration":3.63},{"text":"It was the first time he'd ever seen it done.","start":703.902,"stop":707.195,"duration":3.29},{"text":"He'd only had this torch complete the total of 30 to 35 minutes according to the record.","start":707.195,"stop":712.753,"duration":5.56},{"text":"He runs out there immediately apply his attention to the east to watch this thing that only takes two to three seconds for three cars to go by.","start":712.753,"stop":722.519,"duration":9.77},{"text":"He feels the blaze, backs away, then down he goes.","start":722.519,"stop":725.231,"duration":2.71},{"text":"Now,

to firm up the blaze and back upping to the south and to cause it to envelop him and to come up on top of it.","start":732.335,"stop":748.429,"duration":16.09},{"text":"Now, he was asked by counsel, “Didn't you know that the train passing would cause wind?”","start":748.429,"stop":755.875,"duration":7.45},{"text":"And he said well he thought it would cause wind in the direction it was going, which was to the north, but he did not know that it would cause the blaze to come over the wind, to come over far enough to involve the blaze to the west.","start":755.875,"stop":768.987,"duration":13.11},{"text":"In other words, at 15 feet or 20 feet, he was standing on the shoulder, there was a track intervening a southbound track

there.","start":795.354,"stop":798.385,"duration":3.03},{"text":"No other witness said he shouldn't have stood there.","start":798.385,"stop":801.318,"duration":2.93},{"text":"No other witness said

do.","start":806.155,"stop":808.382,"duration":2.23},{"text":"In fact, if you examine the facts, you'll wonder what else he could have done.","start":808.382,"stop":812.703,"duration":4.32},{"text":"Having in mind that there was a duty imposed on him to watch this train,” and the foreman never says, “He wasn't supposed to watch the train, that he could avoid that.”","start":812.703,"stop":824.507,"duration":11.8},{"text":"Although, counsel suggested that he might well ignored the train and has he ignored the train which he was trying to do, he's trying to do his job which the foreman told him to do and which the foreman doesn't deny.","start":824.507,"stop":838.246,"duration":13.74},{"text":"He's trying to do his job, but

true.","start":845.012,"stop":846.82,"duration":1.81},{"text":"He could've ignored that train and he just stood there and watched the fire, just look at

step.","start":86.785,"stop":96.389,"duration":9.6},{"text":"In addition, as exampled as to why the whole of the case should be looked to, petitioner says that even though the pleaded elements such as the culvert, the condition of the culvert and the hand torch method of firing it right away were not of themselves acts of negligence.","start":96.389,"stop":115.262,"duration":18.87},{"text":"Combined, they were on the theory of Mrs. O'Leary's account on page 21 of appellant's brief or petitioner's brief, wherein it says
