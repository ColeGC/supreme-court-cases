Chief Justice, may it please the Court.","start":20.761,"stop":24.317,"duration":3.56},{"text":"This is a case arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, a suit involving an injured workman on a railroad.","start":24.317,"stop":33.037,"duration":8.72},{"text":"The employee had been hired several months before this accident to perform the duties of an agent-operator on the respondent's railroad lines.","start":33.037,"stop":43.552,"duration":10.52},{"text":"After a few months of training or a short period of training, she was employed first of all on what was -- what was called the extra board.","start":43.552,"stop":51.7,"duration":8.15},{"text":"That meant that she went to various stations up and down the line, filling in for a day or here and there while employees were on vacation or on sick leave.","start":51.7,"stop":61.264,"duration":9.56},{"text":"After a period of several months of doing this kind of work, she bid in and received by a reason of her seniority a regular job as agent and operator on the station at Monahans, Texas, a station in far west Texas.","start":61.264,"stop":76.48,"duration":15.22},{"text":"There on her testimony, it was her job to perform various duties of the clerical nature to take care of train orders and handling tickets and things of that nature.","start":76.48,"stop":86.636,"duration":10.16},{"text":"When she first went to this job -- pardon me, a Mexican laborer, also an employee of the respondent railroad was engaged in handling the mail which came in on a regular passenger train, which passed -- passed through on the petitioner's shift.","start":86.636,"stop":104.781,"duration":18.15},{"text":"Now, handling the mail meant loading up a baggage cart, that sort of thing, follow these individual bags and mail which had been prepared by the postal employees and lock in the postal room, pulling that cart out to the waiting train, climbing up on the cart and picking up the bags and mail individually and tossing them into the Post Office cart, receiving incoming bags of mail, getting down and pulling the cart back into the waiting mail room.","start":104.781,"stop":136.446,"duration":31.66},{"text":"Now, as I have said, when petitioner first went to work on this particular station, a Mexican laborer, who was a witness in the trial of this case, was handling this mail and he continued to handle it up until two or three days before the petitioner's injury.","start":136.446,"stop":153.561,"duration":17.12},{"text":"At that time, she was told by her immediate superior, who was the witness, Higginbotham that she was to handle the mail, she was to handle it alone and with no assistance.","start":153.561,"stop":165.215,"duration":11.65},{"text":"There's no testimony in the record that the handling of the mail up to this time had been improper, that the train could been delayed or that the Mexican laborer was no longer available.","start":165.215,"stop":177.178,"duration":11.96},{"text":"Simply the very statement that her superior requested that she handle the mail.","start":177.178,"stop":183.955,"duration":6.78},{"text":"She did so for two or three days and on about the third day, on the day of the accident, she climbed down from the mail cart after handling several bags of mail weighing 50 to 75 pounds each, felt a sudden catch in her back.","start":183.955,"stop":199.762,"duration":15.81},{"text":"Shortly after that time, she was taken into the hospital and received various treatment over a long period of time.","start":199.762,"stop":207.554,"duration":7.79},{"text":"This case was tried in the Abilene Division of the Northern District of Texas and a jury verdict was returned for the petitioner.","start":207.554,"stop":216.926,"duration":9.37},{"text":"The case was reversed on its merits by the Fifth Circuit and brought here by certiorari.","start":216.926,"stop":224.006,"duration":7.08},{"text":"Now, it is our contention that the Fifth Circuit reversed this case or reversed the jury verdict on two particular grounds.","start":224.006,"stop":235.138,"duration":11.13},{"text":"Both of those grounds are arguments which had been advanced before this Court in numerous decisions arising under this Act and have on each instance been rejected by this Court.","start":235.138,"stop":247.391,"duration":12.25},{"text":"The first of those arguments, one advanced by the railroad, was that this woman was engaged in doing only the usual and customary duties of her employment at the time of the accident or in other words, the whole idea of non-negligence.","start":247.391,"stop":263.138,"duration":15.75},{"text":"Now, we feel that the Fifth Circuit improperly analyzed the record and in arriving at their decision that this was usual and customary and therefore no negligence, that they rely on the very argument, as I have said which have previously been advanced before this Court and rejected.","start":263.138,"stop":282.903,"duration":19.77},{"text":"The testimony is clear that it was not usual and customary as to this particular employee.","start":282.903,"stop":289.61,"duration":6.71},{"text":"The allegations of the petitioner's complaint in the trial court were failure to furnish sufficient help, failure to furnish a safe place to work.","start":289.61,"stop":299.215,"duration":9.6},{"text":"And the jury was charged on that basis and on that basis, on the basis of the testimony of petitioner and the testimony of these other witnesses returned a verdict that she had been furnished improper help.","start":299.215,"stop":313.217,"duration":14},{"text":"Now, the first of these cases arising before this Court after the 1939 amendment to the Act, which was of course the amendment that abolished assumption of risk, was the Tiller case in which this Court set forth a very exhaustive opinion and set forth a very complete summary of the intent of Congress and the responsibilities of the employer under this Act.","start":313.217,"stop":339.68,"duration":26.46},{"text":"The lower court in the Tiller case had advanced the same theory that the Congress by abolishing the defense of assumption of risk had not meant to increase the employer's responsibility towards his employee.","start":339.68,"stop":355.587,"duration":15.91},{"text":"This Court said that that was just another way of saying no negligence and assumption of risk.","start":355.587,"stop":362.517,"duration":6.93},{"text":"In other words, the employer could not simply, by saying this is a usual and customary duty, force the employee to take on whatever risk were involved in performing that job.","start":362.517,"stop":377.008,"duration":14.49},{"text":"And as we said, this was first advanced by this Court in the Tiller case, it has been advanced by this Court down through the years in the Stone case, Blair case, all of which cases had been cited by petitioner and reaffirmed in fact by this Court in three opinions handed down by this Court only last month, the Rogers case and the other cases following.","start":377.008,"stop":402.833,"duration":25.83},{"text":"The second thing that the Fifth Circuit mentioned was a failure to protest sufficiently hard on the part of the employee.","start":402.833,"stop":411.933,"duration":9.1},{"text":"The record showed that several days before this accident occurred, the petitioner's immediate superior told her that she had to handle the mail and had to do it alone.","start":411.933,"stop":422.683,"duration":10.75},{"text":"The petitioner then testified that she had previously been instructed by someone who was hired in the railroad line of organization that it had become the railroad's policy to encourage its women employees to dress in a manner becoming a woman and that this made it impossible for them to climb up on carts and do manual labor.She told her superior that and he said, \"You're hired out to do a man's job and that's what I intend for you to do.\"","start":422.683,"stop":452.775,"duration":30.09}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"What was that last that he said?","start":452.775,"stop":454.019,"duration":1.24},{"text":"I -- I didn't quite get that.","start":454.019,"stop":456.193,"duration":2.17}]},{"speakerName":"Beverly Tarpley","textObjs":[{"text":"I beg your pardon, sir?","start":456.193,"stop":457.042,"duration":0.85}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"I didn't get your last statement that was made.","start":457.042,"stop":460.203,"duration":3.16}]},{"speakerName":"Beverly Tarpley","textObjs":[{"text":"The -- her immediate superior there on the job, the witness Higginbotham, told her in response to her protest about the fact that she could not do this job while wearing the clothing she'd been requested to wear was, \"You have hired out to do a man's job and now those are the duties I see fit for you to do.\"","start":460.203,"stop":481.049,"duration":20.85}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Now, before that, what had been told to her in that regard by a higher superior, did you say?","start":481.049,"stop":487.347,"duration":6.3}]},{"speakerName":"Beverly Tarpley","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, sir.","start":487.347,"stop":488.326,"duration":0.98},{"text":"She had been requested to wear skirts and hose and normal female attire, and such attire made it impossible for her to climb up on mail carts and do the kind of manual labor that her superior insisted.","start":488.326,"stop":503.866,"duration":15.54},{"text":"And during that period of time, the laborer, who was an employee of the railroad, had been doing this work.","start":503.866,"stop":511.88,"duration":8.01},{"text":"So at that point, on a direct order from her superior, she began doing the work and after performing it only two or three times suffered an injury.","start":511.88,"stop":523.22,"duration":11.34},{"text":"Now, the Fifth Circuit held that that was a failure to protest and said that by reason of her failure to protest, she could not recover under the circumstances.","start":523.22,"stop":534.085,"duration":10.87},{"text":"Now, it has been suggested -- pardon me, it has been suggested by the petitioner and we would reiterate here that the conduct of the employee is not the test set forth by Congress or by this Court in its interpretation of the law under -- arising under the statute, that it is the conduct of the employer which is the sole criteria for deciding whether or not there is liability.","start":534.085,"stop":564.026,"duration":29.94},{"text":"I believe that this Court in its case of Rogers versus Missouri Pacific, one of the latest cases deciding, has said that the only ground of inquiry for an appellate court is whether or not the negligence of the employer contributed in the slightest degree to the injury of the employee.","start":564.026,"stop":586.616,"duration":22.59},{"text":"And by reason of that statement and it is a statement which this Court has made many times before, we feel that the Fifth Circuit simply did not follow the interpretation of the law laid down by this Court previously.","start":586.616,"stop":601.805,"duration":15.19},{"text":"They -- we feel that they ignored the sense of this Court's opinions in -- and put improper emphasis on her conduct.","start":601.805,"stop":613.361,"duration":11.56},{"text":"Under those circumstances, we feel that the decision of the trial court ought to be affirmed.","start":613.361,"stop":623.175,"duration":9.81}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr.
