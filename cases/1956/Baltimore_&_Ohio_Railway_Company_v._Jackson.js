question is also involved whether or not the push truck which appears on the second page is a locomotive, tender, car, or a similar vehicle as that -- as those terms are used in Section 8 of the

Act.","start":230.448,"stop":236.206,"duration":5.76},{"text":"Congress has required railroads to furnish certain equipment for use of the operation of the railroad.","start":236.206,"stop":242.512,"duration":6.31},{"text":"Among those that are necessary as in this particular case was that the law required the railroad to have handbrakes on this truck

railroads used to haul workmen and tools to and from stations to the place of work along the line.","start":312.974,"stop":340.978,"duration":28},{"text":"We sought certiorari because 60,000 or more

them out at the place where -- where they work, and they must be removed in a hurry if a regular train -- if they happen to meet a regular train travelling along the line.","start":390.1,"stop":430.333,"duration":40.23},{"text":"Now, it is our position that the Safety Appliance Act in terms does not apply to these vehicles and was never intended

of maintenance-of-way employees, and they've had that brotherhood since 1887.","start":456.846,"stop":468.761,"duration":11.92},{"text":"The language of the Act clearly applies to trains and refers to trains.","start":468.761,"stop":478.391,"duration":9.63},{"text":"Section 1 use these terms in imposing the requirements that a power brake be used on the locomotive and that a train brake system be used in a train.","start":478.391,"stop":488.146,"duration":9.75},{"text":"It uses terms like locomotive engine, train-brake system, train, engineer, refers to a locomotive's drawing of

maintenance-of-way vehicles are not exchanged between railroad as ordinary freight cars are.","start":520.131,"stop":530.361,"duration":10.23},{"text":"Section 8 defines the coverage of this Act in terms of trains, locomotives, tenders, cars and similar vehicles.","start":530.361,"stop":541.953,"duration":11.59},{"text":"Now, the respondent argues that these are cars and since they are cars, and

cars.","start":555.358,"stop":568.216,"duration":12.86},{"text":"But in any event, we understand why the respondent does not wish the Court to refer to the legislative history for the Act, because
