sum of $250,000.","start":167.231,"stop":187.283,"duration":20.05},{"text":"While on these excursions from custody, the bankrupt contacted Jaffke, the petitioner

December of 1950, approximately a year and a half after the entry of the turnover order and payments were made by Jaffke to Knetzer through October of 1951.","start":216.219,"stop":237.161,"duration":20.94},{"text":"After this money had been obtained from Jaffke, he subsequently discovered that he had been the

asset.","start":248.053,"stop":258.608,"duration":10.56},{"text":"Pursuant to this conversation, the bankrupt executed an affidavit, which in effect states, that he had borrowed $47,000 from Jaffke

scheme.","start":316.781,"stop":339.766,"duration":22.99},{"text":"The trial court found that the -- Knetzer had committed a fraud on Jaffke and the appellate court affirmed that finding of

appeared, further, that the trustee in bankruptcy had, on several occasions, been approached by Knetzer while he was a civil contemnor at a time from one to two years subsequent to the time when he had been adjudged to -- a civil contemnor for failure to comply with his turnover order.","start":356.015,"stop":382.584,"duration":26.57},{"text":"And pursuant to Knetzer's request, the trustee would call his attorney or would call the bankruptcy judge who sentenced Knetzer to jail and would ask that Knetzer have additional time free from incarceration.","start":382.584,"stop":401.658,"duration":19.07},{"text":"This was done on representations by Knetzer to his trustee in bankruptcy that he would obtain additional assets so as to comply with the turnover order.","start":401.658,"stop":414.411,"duration":12.75},{"text":"Now, the evidence also discloses that there were small payments running over a period, starting in approximately September of 1950 and continuing on until February of 1952.","start":414.411,"stop":435.292,"duration":20.88},{"text":"These payments ran from $1000, $5000 or $10,000

estate, he so testified.","start":448.407,"stop":467,"duration":18.59},{"text":"He further testified that at no time did he make any inquiry of the bankrupt as to where these assets had been obtained, and this was true, even though the payments were made in 1950, 1951, and 1952, the bankrupt had been adjudicated as such in 1948 and the -- the turnover order or $250,000 had been entered in the middle of 1949.","start":467,"stop":504.725,"duration":37.73},{"text":"It further appeared, in addition to this, that third parties had come in to the trustee in bankruptcy, and said, I will be responsible or so much a week, in once instance, I will be responsible for $1000 a day under Knetzer's turnover order.","start":504.725,"stop":524.101,"duration":19.38},{"text":"Now, a desired position here, of course, that all of these facts taken together placed the trustee on notice and required him to inquire as to where Knetzer was obtaining these funds.","start":524.101,"stop":539.738,"duration":15.64},{"text":"The trial court found for petitioner, Jaffke, the petitioner here, entered a judgment in a sum of $27,400.","start":539.738,"stop":552.539,"duration":12.8},{"text":"The trial court specifically found that Jaffke had been defrauded by Knetzer, it specifically found that $27,400 of Jaffke's money had been paid in to the trustee in bankruptcy in purported compliance with his turnover order and that the trustee in bankruptcy had no right to these assets because they were after acquired property and were in fact the property of Jaffke.","start":552.539,"stop":585.376,"duration":32.84},{"text":"The Court also found that the equities of the case were with the petitioner Jaffke.","start":585.376,"stop":593.956,"duration":8.58},{"text":"However, at the trial, there was admitted in the evidence the affidavit signed by the bankrupt admitting that he had turned $36,000 of Jaffke's money over to the trustee in bankruptcy to buy further freedom from jail so that he could make installment payments to the trustee and gain a little more time out of jail.","start":593.956,"stop":625.013,"duration":31.06},{"text":"While this affidavit was admitted at the trial, nevertheless, the trial court, after finding for petitioner, struck the affidavit from evidence, no reason was given for this.","start":625.013,"stop":638.212,"duration":13.2},{"text":"The respondent trustee appealed at the Court of Appeals and his main point before that Court was that there was no evidence to demonstrate that Jaffke's money had in fact been turned over to the trustee in bankruptcy.","start":638.212,"stop":660.268,"duration":22.06},{"text":"The Court of Appeals passed on several other points raised by the appellant's trustee in bankruptcy and then stated, but because no cross-appeal has been filed by the appellee, Jaffke, in this case, we cannot consider the evidence which was stricken by the trial court, namely, this affidavit, and consequently, there is no evidence in the record to demonstrate that Knetzer did in fact turned Jaffke's money over to the trustee in bankruptcy.","start":660.268,"stop":701.617,"duration":41.35},{"text":"Now, I would like to emphasize again that Knetzer had died prior to the trial of this case.","start":701.617,"stop":710.214,"duration":8.6},{"text":"Consequently, the Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and instead of remanding the case for further proceedings, entered judgment for the appellant, the trustee in bankruptcy.","start":710.214,"stop":731.296,"duration":21.08},{"text":"Now, there is no question, I think, under the decisions of this Court, under the decisions of other courts that the appellee in -- in an appellate tribunal has the right to urge in support of his judgment in the District Court, any matter that was urged in the trial court, the cases are clear on that.","start":731.296,"stop":758.511,"duration":27.21},{"text":"In fact, I would like to point out to this Court that the trustee, the respondent here has urged before this Court an argument which it made to the appellate court but it did not file a cross-petition for certiorari.I","start":758.511,"stop":775.878,"duration":17.37},{"text":"ndeed, it would not have standing to do so.","start":775.878,"stop":778.669,"duration":2.79},{"text":"He was a victorious party in the Court of Appeals and that is another reason why the petitioner here, Jaffke, could not have filed a
