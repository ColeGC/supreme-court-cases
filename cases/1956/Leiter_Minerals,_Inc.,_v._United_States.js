extension.","start":360.455,"stop":395.89,"duration":35.44},{"text":"Those issues were presented to the District Court, briefed and argued and taken under advisement and Judge Wright after

previously filed state court.","start":412.036,"stop":432.722,"duration":20.69},{"text":"That the state court had no jurisdiction whatsoever and further, that the United States was an indispensable party to the state court litigation which had previously been filed by petitioner and which now stands enjoined.","start":432.722,"stop":449.28,"duration":16.56},{"text":"The crucial and the chronological facts leading up to the legal questions of which are involved are these.","start":449.28,"stop":456.118,"duration":6.84},{"text":"In 1935, an option was granted by the trustees of the

Thomas Leiter, the sole heir of Joseph Leiter, deceased, actually made the deed, executed the deed and -- and consummated the deal and reserved the minerals under the land which of them -- which is the reason in controversy here, for an expressed term of 10 years.","start":494.81,"stop":517.397,"duration":22.59},{"text":"Now, if I may digress just a moment.","start":517.397,"stop":519.609,"duration":2.21},{"text":"Under the law of Louisiana, that the grant of reservation of minerals, creates non-ownership of those minerals as specific things apart from the soil which they underlie but under the law of Louisiana, the civil law, that concept of property.","start":519.609,"stop":538.381,"duration":18.77},{"text":"It creates merely a servitude or an easement or -- or a right to go and explore for and produce those minerals which may underlie the land, which servitude a reason if not exercised for 10 years, expires by a prescription or a limitation.","start":538.381,"stop":559.216,"duration":20.84},{"text":"In 1940, a year and a half after Thomas Leiter made his reservation when he made his deed to the Government of minerals for 10 years, the legislature of Louisiana passed Act 315 of -- of that year, providing and Your -- if Your Honors care to read it that the -- the 1940 Act is quoted verbatim, page 45, appendix (a) in the petitioner's brief.","start":559.216,"stop":585.889,"duration":26.67},{"text":"It's very short, “Providing that where minerals are reserved in a deed to the United States affecting land in Louisiana and the minerals are reserved, such mineral rights shall be imprescriptible.”","start":585.889,"stop":606.697,"duration":20.81},{"text":"In other words, they -- they will not as --

restrained.","start":620.732,"stop":626.349,"duration":5.62},{"text":"He decided in favor of petitioner on the question of the merit, you see because the California Company and Lobrano had put an

a middle ground which was something like this.","start":642.714,"stop":645.821,"duration":3.11},{"text":"The Act -- the reservation as I have stated and if Your Honors care to make a note where the reservation appears in extent so it's page 46 of petitioner's brief.","start":645.821,"stop":655.274,"duration":9.45},{"text":"The reservation in three parts, in three separate places reserves those minerals for 10 years which is what the term would have been for minerals in an ordinary reservation, but for the Act of 1940.","start":655.274,"stop":670.113,"duration":14.84},{"text":"There's another terminal data from which respondents rely on the merits which of course are not really at issue here.","start":670.113,"stop":677.333,"duration":7.22},{"text":"The -- in the First Circuit set ups of the reserving clause, it is provided that the right of inquiry for these minerals will terminate or expire on April 1st, 1945.","start":677.333,"stop":692.648,"duration":15.32},{"text":"Remember, this is now the 5th of 19 -- December 1938 deed, six and a half years after the execution of the deed in the reservation.","start":692.648,"stop":701.237,"duration":8.59},{"text":"There is this seeming inconsistent expiration date.","start":701.237,"stop":705.793,"duration":4.56},{"text":"Judge Nunez concluded from the language of the deed and from the effect of the Act that the earliest and you can see the inconsistent terminal date or cutoff date related only to the right of inquiry.","start":705.793,"stop":719.867,"duration":14.07},{"text":"It didn't affect the reservation of the minerals as a whole and he said that as to the mineral reservation at of the whole which was expressly for 10 years, the Act of 1940 suspended that prescription and made imprescriptible petitioner's rights.","start":719.867,"stop":734.578,"duration":14.71},{"text":"Well no respondents really make fun of petitioner's contention on the merits, although those again are not here before Your Honors.","start":734.578,"stop":741.746,"duration":7.17},{"text":"They say it would be absurd to say that you'd a right to enter or -- or explore for minerals if you didn't have a right to enter and explore for minerals, but that's not absurd at all.","start":741.746,"stop":752.265,"duration":10.52},{"text":"If I'm -- I'm still digressing on the merits because respondents you see make or take great issue with us and present the merits of the case and it does here only on review of an interlocutory order of injunction, but we feel that we should at least present the issues not to Your Honor to show that Judge had -- Nunez had questions of substance before you, substance in deciding and in petitioner's favor.","start":752.265,"stop":777.387,"duration":25.12},{"text":"And so, it gives weight to petitioner's claims that -- of -- of title and the right to recover the wrongfully withheld possession that is certainly not a capricious or fictitious claim.","start":777.387,"stop":788.316,"duration":10.93},{"text":"Judge Nunez in holding that the right of entry only expires and that the right to the minerals themselves were reserved and made imprescriptible is entirely consistent with what is known in the industry as directional drilling.","start":788.316,"stop":802.746,"duration":14.43},{"text":"As -- as Your Honors no doubt, has known for many years it has been possible to explore a point, produce mines and minerals and from the Pegasus type without ever entering the premises at all.","start":802.746,"stop":815.222,"duration":12.48},{"text":"The science had developed for years to such an extent that even though no entry at all in the premises to which the mineral rights apply -- mineral rights apply is made.","start":815.222,"stop":826.648,"duration":11.43},{"text":"You may make a surface location and deviate from the vertical directionally as to angles up to 45 degrees and for distances along the horizontal plane for distances in excess of a mile.","start":826.648,"stop":839.87,"duration":13.22},{"text":"So, it would be entirely consistent to say as Judge Nunez did, taking in an -- a contract interpretation approach here, that the right of entry expired, but the expressed reservation of the minerals for 10 years was effective and the legislature of Louisiana made it imprescriptible in an Act which was a validly an exercise of the public policy of the State to preserve the minerals for its citizens.","start":839.87,"stop":868.815,"duration":28.95},{"text":"With that, the status of the case when the restraining order was granted, there had been a decision in the state court in this in rem or quasi in rem suit and it'd been a decision favorable to petitioner and that entire litigation is now enjoined at the hands of the District Court and that has received the approval of the Circuit Court for three reasons which we urge in our motion.","start":868.815,"stop":893.365,"duration":24.55},{"text":"It is submitted by petitioner that the order below was incorrect.","start":893.365,"stop":897.559,"duration":4.19},{"text":"At the threshold, the injunction was forbidden by the anti-injunction statute which I think if Your Honors want to refer to in its extreme degree, you're familiar with it, I'm sure.","start":897.559,"stop":910.57,"duration":13.01},{"text":"It's on page 3 of petitioner's brief.","start":910.57,"stop":914.139,"duration":3.57},{"text":"It's now -- since 1948, Section 22-83 of title 28 of the United States Code and it reads, “A code of the United States may not stay proceedings in the state court, except as of -- expressly authorized by an Act of Congress or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction or to protect or effectuate its judgments.”","start":914.139,"stop":941.354,"duration":27.22},{"text":"Of the three exceptions that are carved out of it by the expressed language of the -- of 2283, two may be laid aside immediately.","start":941.354,"stop":949.808,"duration":8.45},{"text":"First, there is no congressional authorization to the injunction below, respondent's point denied.","start":949.808,"stop":959.05,"duration":9.24},{"text":"There is no judgment which is attempted that is beneath this issue it signed or executed which it attempted to be protected or effectuated.","start":959.05,"stop":968.5,"duration":9.45},{"text":"Similarly, the phrase, the third exception where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction will not comfort or aid respondents here.","start":968.5,"stop":979.788,"duration":11.29},{"text":"The purpose of the phrase in aide of its jurisdiction was included in the 1948 revision of the Code.","start":979.788,"stop":988.865,"duration":9.08},{"text":"According to the expressed reviser's note, “To make it conform to another section of the judicial code and to make clear, the Court -- the federal court's recognized power to stay state court proceedings in cases removed to it, under the removal procedure.","start":988.865,"stop":1007.925,"duration":19.06},{"text":"Further, if as respondents say, that phrase of -- of -- in aid of its jurisdiction, if that were to supersede or allow it to overcome the anti-injunction law on -- on the ground that since the federal court has general jurisdiction of claims brought by the United States, if it completely in all respect supersede the anti-injunction law, because the language of the -- of 13-45 which confer it generally jurisdiction of the United States courts to in cases brought by United States is exactly phrased as is the regular diversity jurisdiction or in cases of general federal questions or as in 13-37, cases arising under any Act of Congress which regulates Commerce between the states.","start":1007.925,"stop":1056.764,"duration":48.84},{"text":"So, if we were to say that merely because the United States Courts have -- have general jurisdiction, not exclusive of the suits brought to the United States, if that were to be allowed to -- to overcome the anti-injunction law, then you have no anti-injunction statute at all because the -- the act of conferring general jurisdiction on the federal court in cases brought by the Government is in the same language as all of the other is executed of jurisdiction upon the District Court.","start":1056.764,"stop":1087.605,"duration":30.84},{"text":"And Your Honors, we say, held that very thing in a case which is if not precisely the same because
