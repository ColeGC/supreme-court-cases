reason.","start":259.613,"stop":266.813,"duration":7.2},{"text":"It is well settled by the decisions of this Court that where a barge is solely in control of a tug, she is not liable and her value does not have to be included in the limitation fund unless she'd be guilty of some individual fault in rem of her own, and there was at that time no claim that she was.","start":266.813,"stop":291.478,"duration":24.67},{"text":"This respondent accepted to our petition on the ground that we had not given adequate security and claimed on that occasion that the

value of the two vessels plus the freight money.","start":306.893,"stop":326.148,"duration":19.26},{"text":"In that proceeding, in that limitation of liability proceeding, this respondent filed her answer in denying our claim to limit liability if liable, and of course, denying that we are entitled to exoneration.","start":326.148,"stop":342.739,"duration":16.59},{"text":"In that proceeding, however, she filed claim in a substantially reduced amount, namely, for $250,000 instead of $500,000.","start":342.739,"stop":353.179,"duration":10.44},{"text":"In that proceeding also, the 10 other

here.","start":353.179,"stop":368.331,"duration":15.15},{"text":"So that these claims which -- when the petition was filed, aggregate of $657,500 with six more to be heard from were -- when all the claims were filed in the limitation proceeding itself, only $259,500.","start":368.331,"stop":393.404,"duration":25.07},{"text":"At that stage, this respondent again made a motion in the District Court, this time to vacate the injunction on the ground that the claims could not possibly equal the fund that an inadequate fund was necessary to sustain the proceeding, and therefore, she wanted to have the restraining order vacated as to her and allow her to proceed in the District Court.","start":393.404,"stop":425.396,"duration":31.99},{"text":"This came on before

the motion on the ground that it could not yet be said that the fund would necessarily be adequate.","start":432.509,"stop":448.577,"duration":16.07},{"text":"For this reason, the fund will be made up, assuming that there is liability at all, the fund will be made up of the value of the tug if the tug is at fault, of the barge if the barge is at fault but not of either that is not personally at fault in rem.","start":448.577,"stop":468.339,"duration":19.76},{"text":"So, my argument was, and Judge Weinfeld agreed with my argument at that time, that you can't say that this fund is bound to be enough until you decide which of these vessels was liable in rem.","start":468.339,"stop":482.597,"duration":14.26},{"text":"And you can't do that until after trial, and therefore, you should not vacate the restraining order and allow this action at law in the state court to go along by itself.","start":482.597,"stop":495.787,"duration":13.19},{"text":"The judge agreed with all of that and denied the motion but he added a little caveat at the end of his opinion and he said; however, if this respondent, claimant as she was called in that Court, will reduce her claims so that the amount of the claims against each vessel is less than that vessel's value, then she may proceed in the state court.","start":495.787,"stop":525.106,"duration":29.32},{"text":"Well, with that advice from the judge, the necessary stipulations and so on were filed in the District Court and a new motion was made to vacate the restraining order as to this respondent and that motion was granted.","start":525.106,"stop":542.947,"duration":17.84},{"text":"The theory then being that there were two funds, two sort of separate proceedings, which the Court of Appeal later said very explicitly, one for the tug and one for the barge.","start":542.947,"stop":558.348,"duration":15.4},{"text":"This respondent had allocated her $250,000 claim, a $100,000 to the tug, and a $150,000 to the barge.","start":558.348,"stop":568.53,"duration":10.18},{"text":"So that when you add the $9000 I had claimed for all the other 10, the aggregate of the claims against the tug is less than her value and the aggregate of the claims against the barge is less than the barge's value.","start":568.53,"stop":582.321,"duration":13.79}]},{"speakerName":"Hugo L. Black","textObjs":[{"text":"There is no -- no change in the common ownership of the barge and the tug at any point along the

decision and the Court of Appeals affirmed by divided court.","start":598.112,"stop":608.708,"duration":10.6},{"text":"Judge Frank and Judge Clark were the majority and Judge Hincks wrote the minority opinion.","start":608.708,"stop":616.691,"duration":7.98},{"text":"The affirmance was on two grounds.","start":616.691,"stop":618.662,"duration":1.97},{"text":"One, that concourse may only be had in these cases when the fund is definitely not adequate.","start":618.662,"stop":627.749,"duration":9.09},{"text":"You've got -- you've got to have an inadequate fund as a prerequisite to sustaining a limitation of liability proceeding.","start":627.749,"stop":636.945,"duration":9.2},{"text":"And the Court went along with Judge

of Appeals held it must be treated as if these were two separate proceedings, one for the tug and one for the barge and the fund in each is adequate on the basis of the arithmetic that I have told you about.","start":657.359,"stop":671.286,"duration":13.93}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"Could you -- would you be good enough to state affirmatively what it is you do

decisions of this Court, as I believe, taken in to the reenactment of the statute in 1936, make it perfectly plain that one of the two basic reasons for the limitation of liability proceeding is to bring all claims in such a case into concourse so that the merits may be disposed of, the liabilities may be disposed of in one proceeding affecting all the parties at the same time, not only to distribute an inadequate fund, it isn't a kind of a bankruptcy, it's more than that.","start":685.559,"stop":733.137,"duration":47.58}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"It's a

now.","start":762.871,"stop":766.44,"duration":3.57},{"text":"The -- the origin of this so-called rule in the Second Circuit, as I have referred to it in my brief, is just such a case, it was the

rule for which I would contend in the last analysis in this Court is simply this.","start":849.453,"stop":861.853,"duration":12.4},{"text":"That if at the time the petition is filed, the vessel owner, in good faith, fears -- reasonably fears, if you like, that the claims will exceed the fund, he is entitled to file his petition and the Court cannot be -- and jurisdiction properly attaches at that

pessimistic.","start":861.853,"stop":893.285,"duration":31.43}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"That's a very different thing from regarding it merely as a suit, as a
