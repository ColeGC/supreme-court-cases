legislative history of the 1921 Act, that the reason for putting that provision in the statute was that the tax collector without it has no power to waive a tax and if he has made a mistake and

see.","start":366.199,"stop":371.488,"duration":5.29},{"text":"Now, taxpayer seems to hint rather darkly that the Commissioner cannot be trusted with discretion under these circumstances.","start":371.488,"stop":380.823,"duration":9.33},{"text":"Well, that seems to be right in the face of the statute which Congress has enacted.","start":380.823,"stop":386.413,"duration":5.59},{"text":"It seems to us that if Congress was afraid that the Commissioner would abuse his discretion that it would have put the brakes on it

up.","start":396.158,"stop":404.234,"duration":8.08},{"text":"There is another question as to this retroactive revocation and that has to do with the running of the statute of limitations.","start":404.234,"stop":413.998,"duration":9.76},{"text":"The law says that the statute of -- that the Commissioner can assess the deficiency in tax within three years only, within three years from the time the return is filed.","start":413.998,"stop":427.194,"duration":13.2},{"text":"And another section of the Code says that if no return was filed, there is no statute of limitations.","start":427.194,"stop":438.989,"duration":11.79},{"text":"The taxpayer here admits that he never filed a tax return, but he does say that the mere fact that he was excused from filing a tax return was enough to start the statute of limitations.","start":438.989,"stop":454.004,"duration":15.02},{"text":"His authority on this seems to be a decision of the Second Circuit, the Balkan

agent, some years later, said that that wasn't a return and assessed the deficiency.","start":474.565,"stop":483.248,"duration":8.68},{"text":"The Second Circuit held in that case that after all the

action.","start":483.248,"stop":498.504,"duration":15.26},{"text":"Here, we say that that -- they were never presented from filing a return as in that particular case.","start":498.504,"stop":506.112,"duration":7.61},{"text":"There is one further point on this and that is that during the years in question, certain information returns were filed by the taxpayer in this case.","start":506.112,"stop":516.227,"duration":10.11},{"text":"These are Form 990 and do not, in anyway, represent or resemble the regular corporation income tax return.","start":516.227,"stop":526.177,"duration":9.95},{"text":"Now, in order to understand exactly what was the reason behind the requirement of filing this return, we have to go back to the legislative history of the 1943 Act when it was put in.","start":526.177,"stop":537.275,"duration":11.1},{"text":"At that time, Congress was becoming very concerned about charities, which were operating business in competition with regular taxpaying organizations.","start":537.275,"stop":548.427,"duration":11.15},{"text":"They were also concerned with so-called theatre-corporations where they earn a spaghetti business or some other business and all their profits go to a charity because all their stock is owned by it and they say they're exempt.","start":548.427,"stop":560.675,"duration":12.25},{"text":"Congress in 1943 wanted to do something about that but they said that we are in possession of sufficient information to be able to act intelligently on this problem.","start":560.675,"stop":571.396,"duration":10.72},{"text":"So therefore, they directed the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to require organizations which have been given exemption to file certain information in order to allow a study of the problem to be made.","start":571.396,"stop":587.514,"duration":16.12},{"text":"This, in other words, was merely for
