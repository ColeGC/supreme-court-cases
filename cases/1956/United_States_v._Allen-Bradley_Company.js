plant which would be leased to a private manufacture at an annual basis.","start":690.991,"stop":705.266,"duration":14.27},{"text":"Or another avenue was the so-called defense plant facilities contracts under which we advanced the money to the contractor, deeds of legal title to the plant that was built but the beneficial use was in the United

at the sacrifice of revenue which might otherwise be collected.","start":723.901,"stop":743.194,"duration":19.29},{"text":"The amortization program -- the amortization provisions were nothing more than accelerated depreciation.","start":743.194,"stop":754.036,"duration":10.84},{"text":"What Congress did was to tell the taxpayer if you obtain a certificate from proper officials that the plant or a portion of it is necessary in the interest of the national defense, we will give you absolute assurance that those certified cause can be deducted by you against your income during a period of no more than five years.","start":754.036,"stop":781.276,"duration":27.24},{"text":"Or that was the other limits, at higher cost to be written off during that

and when the emergency terminated.","start":788.393,"stop":807.502,"duration":19.11},{"text":"So that when I use the term amortization as a statute, that's what we're talking about really, is accelerated depreciation.","start":807.502,"stop":817.433,"duration":9.93},{"text":"Depreciation would still be a problem as it is on these cases and other cases where only part of the cost were subject to amortization.","start":817.433,"stop":826.792,"duration":9.36},{"text":"In other words, you like to get part of your cost within the five-year period or less and the rest of the cost would be spread over the normal period for depreciation, whatever the useful life of the property was 10, 15, 20 years.","start":826.792,"stop":840.101,"duration":13.31},{"text":"So that ultimately, you got your whole cost back in tax deduction but the real question was how much would you get back rapidly during a period when it was expected that tax rates would be abnormally high.","start":840.101,"stop":853.601,"duration":13.5},{"text":"And it was in this background that Congress enacted the Second Revenue Act of 1940 adopted the excess profits tax ended up with the amortization provisions of which we deal.","start":853.601,"stop":866.016,"duration":12.41},{"text":"During the early period of the -- of its administration, these certificates were being issued by

warranted.","start":878.118,"stop":893.648,"duration":15.53},{"text":"Now, the problem of this case arise from the fact that by 1943 -- the middle of 1943, the administration had become convinced that

needed.","start":904.52,"stop":910.711,"duration":6.19},{"text":"And that thereafter, the problem was one of utilizing those plants, taking whatever resource that we had available to funnel through the plant -- plants to get the production of materials.","start":910.711,"stop":923.46,"duration":12.75},{"text":"And at that point, it was first suggested that the amortization provisions be dropped
