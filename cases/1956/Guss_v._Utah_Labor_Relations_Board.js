amended to add certain unfair labor practices of employer -- of employees as well as employers, but it was not amended to conform to the Taft-Hartley Act which was passed in the same year and it has

in the Act.","start":365.218,"stop":384.7,"duration":19.48},{"text":"We raised the issue of the power of the State Board to issue any order in this action at the commencement of the hearing and

I think that this case I have here has these distinctions from the two which we have heard before.","start":445.756,"stop":457.246,"duration":11.49},{"text":"One, and I think perhaps the most important that here, there is a state board and a state statute involved rather than a state court.","start":457.246,"stop":467.987,"duration":10.74},{"text":"Secondly, the National Board actually asserted jurisdiction in the proceedings and then within -- within two months after that, declined to exercise jurisdiction over unclaimed unfair labor practices arriving -- rising out -- out of the very election which the National Board had conducted.","start":467.987,"stop":491.394,"duration":23.41},{"text":"And thirdly, different from the other two, is an employer here who is raising the issue, point being that the sword of exclusiveness of 10 (a) cuts both ways.","start":491.394,"stop":508.898,"duration":17.5},{"text":"We join with counsel for the unions in the two preceding cases in our position that based on the express language of 10 (a) based on its legislative history, it provides the only, the exclusive manner in which the States may act in matters affecting interstate commerce where there are parallel provisions between state and federal law, and this is certainly one of those.","start":508.898,"stop":545.569,"duration":36.67},{"text":"We have the same pattern in

employers.","start":545.569,"stop":568.018,"duration":22.45},{"text":"But aside from that same general framework as I have pointed out, there are -- are real and substantial differences.","start":568.018,"stop":576.978,"duration":8.96},{"text":"And of course, one of the most important from the standpoint of an employer and his employees who may be members of the union which is seeking to organize his employees is a question of -- of Sections 9 (f) and (g) of the National Act which require the union before it can avail itself of the National Board to file the non-Communist affidavit of its officers and the provisions which require the union officers to file financial statements.","start":576.978,"stop":611.39,"duration":34.41},{"text":"Those protections are not given in the Utah Act.","start":611.39,"stop":616.108,"duration":4.72},{"text":"So that if the Utah Act is applied, certainly, this employer and his employees are deprived of rights given to them under the National Act.","start":616.108,"stop":632.156,"duration":16.05},{"text":"Therefore, if the Board can do as it attempted to do in this case and merely by declining to act, place jurisdiction in the State Board, it can do that which Congress said it couldn't do and that is make an employer who's been as affects interstate commerce subject to statutes which are different from
