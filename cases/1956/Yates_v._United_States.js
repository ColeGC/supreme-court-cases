of course since Dennis that this Court has agreed to hear.","start":136.64,"stop":145.144,"duration":8.5},{"text":"I think that the Court should know at the outset that the indictment in this case, names all of the defendants in the Dennis case as co-conspirators with the defendants in this case.","start":145.144,"stop":162.976,"duration":17.83},{"text":"The theory of the respondent has been at all stages of this case that the conspiracy charged in this case is identical with the one in Dennis sustained by the decision of this Court.","start":162.976,"stop":179.504,"duration":16.53},{"text":"It might be wrong then at the outset to consider to what extent the facts in this case and those in the Dennis case are similar than to what extent they're differ.","start":179.504,"stop":195.513,"duration":16.01},{"text":"There are, in my opinion, only two facts common to both cases, two general facts.One is that in both cases all of the defendants were admittedly members of the Communist Party.","start":195.513,"stop":214.495,"duration":18.98},{"text":"No issue in Dennis about that and no issue here.","start":214.495,"stop":218.63,"duration":4.13},{"text":"The second is, that in both cases essentially the same books, the so-called “Marxist-Leninist” books were introduced into evidence and essentially the same passages from those books are relied upon by the respondent.","start":218.63,"stop":239.832,"duration":21.2},{"text":"I believe that there is no other fact of consequence that is the same in the two cases.","start":239.832,"stop":248.984,"duration":9.15},{"text":"The differences are numerous as a comparison of the findings in Dennis remembering that the Court did not pass upon the sufficiency of the events on that case, but accepted the findings of the Court of Appeals and acted upon them.","start":248.984,"stop":266.439,"duration":17.46},{"text":"So we take a comparison of the findings in Dennis with the record in this case where the Court has agreed to review the sufficiency of the evidence.","start":266.439,"stop":278.332,"duration":11.89},{"text":"In Dennis, it was found, and may I say at the outset that the Court said in Dennis that these findings were essential to its decision to the finding that the statute as applied was constitutional.","start":278.332,"stop":295.996,"duration":17.66},{"text":"The first finding is that the petitioners were the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States.","start":295.996,"stop":302.864,"duration":6.87},{"text":"That they were all members of a small, compact, top governing body.","start":302.864,"stop":310.883,"duration":8.02},{"text":"This was charged in the indictment.","start":310.883,"stop":312.915,"duration":2.03},{"text":"This was the undisputed evidence.","start":312.915,"stop":315.713,"duration":2.8},{"text":"This -- they were all members of the group known as the National Board of the Party.","start":315.713,"stop":323.116,"duration":7.4},{"text":"None of the defendants, none of the petitioners in this case are or ever were members of that body.","start":323.116,"stop":331.025,"duration":7.91},{"text":"During the period within the statute of limitations of the 11 petitioners who I represent, only four -- first of all not a single one of them held any national position, not one.","start":331.025,"stop":340.046,"duration":9.02},{"text":"Only four held positions as officials of the state organization, the California State Organization of the Communist Party and they were members of the state committee of that Party.","start":340.046,"stop":359.9,"duration":19.85},{"text":"Of the remaining six, there is evidence that two others, on some occasions, attended meetings of that state committee.","start":359.9,"stop":369.831,"duration":9.93},{"text":"Of the remaining petitioners, five held offices and the highest level of which was the county.","start":369.831,"stop":379.714,"duration":9.88},{"text":"They were county officials in the County of Los Angeles or County of San Franscisco.","start":379.714,"stop":385.14,"duration":5.43},{"text":"Two never held any officers above a city level.","start":385.14,"stop":391.667,"duration":6.53},{"text":"And whereas in Dennis, there was the common relationship between all of the defendants in that case by reason not only of their common membership on the National Board but by reason of their acts as found, as members of the National Board.","start":391.667,"stop":410.748,"duration":19.08},{"text":"In this record, there is nothing showing common activity on the part of these petitioners at least in the same sense, unless that common activity be that they were all members of the Communist Party and as members of the Communist Party independently within the Communist Party carried on certain activities.","start":410.748,"stop":437.18,"duration":26.43},{"text":"The Dennis case proceeds also upon the finding that the petitioners on that case, and I believe these are the words used by the Court, were unwilling to work within the framework of democracy.","start":437.18,"stop":455.029,"duration":17.85},{"text":"I am not here discussing the sufficiency of the findings in Dennis, this Court didn't.","start":455.029,"stop":460.095,"duration":5.07},{"text":"We must assume for the purpose of the argument that they were supported by the record and this Court did.","start":460.095,"stop":466.162,"duration":6.07},{"text":"Here, the record is replete with statements of support for, and work, and plans all within the framework about democratic process relating to legislation, relating to running for office, relating to discussion of various issues which were current controversial issues being decided within the framework of our democratic process with these petitioners taking their part in making that decision, small, minority, and popularism might be.","start":466.162,"stop":504.904,"duration":38.74},{"text":"As a matter of fact, a great deal of this evidence.","start":504.904,"stop":508.889,"duration":3.99},{"text":"In fact perhaps a major portion of this evidence with respect to the almost total preoccupation of these defendants with their activities within the framework of our democratic process, came from respondent's witnesses and as a result of their direct examination, because of the theory which respondent proceeds on in this case, and that is, that any activity within the Communist Party, according to the respondent, is evidence of participation in the conspiracy.","start":508.889,"stop":541.554,"duration":32.66},{"text":"This is a subject that I'll come back to a number of times during the course of my argument.","start":541.554,"stop":547.295,"duration":5.74},{"text":"Next, there was a finding in the Dennis case that the defendants there intended to initiate a violent revolution whenever the propitious occasion occurred.","start":547.295,"stop":560.719,"duration":13.42},{"text":"Now that finding did not result from independent evidence of intent, but as the decision indicates was a finding which arose out of the other findings of the activities of the petitioners in that case of the Dennis defendants, that is their activities as members of the National Board, their advocacy and the other findings that I referred to here.","start":560.719,"stop":588.316,"duration":27.6},{"text":"In other words, intent came as a direct result there of findings of fact, none of which are present in this case, none of which can be supported by the record in this case.","start":588.316,"stop":601.821,"duration":13.5},{"text":"Moreover, concededly that intent could be deduced from findings of activities other than those which it was found the Dennis defendants' engagement.","start":601.821,"stop":615.678,"duration":13.86},{"text":"But I believe we will demonstrate, I believe -- I believe our brief demonstrates that there is no basis for any finding with respect to anyone of these petitioners resulting from their activities, resulting from their knowledge as shown by the evidence to support a finding of this kind of intent.","start":615.678,"stop":638.562,"duration":22.88},{"text":"Next was probably the most important single finding made in Dennis.","start":638.562,"stop":645.51,"duration":6.95},{"text":"In Dennis, this Court may remember, the indictment was returned, I believe, some three days short or three years after the reconstitution of the Communist Party just barely in time to bring that reconstitution within the limits of the statute of limitations if in fact the Government intended to rely probably on that.","start":645.51,"stop":674.011,"duration":28.5},{"text":"And the finding that was made with respect to these laws, that these defendants, these members of the top governing board, use their control of the Communist Political Association, which has been organized in 1944 some 13 or 14 months earlier as a result of the dissolution of the Communist Party.","start":674.011,"stop":696.685,"duration":22.67},{"text":"That they had used their control of the Communist Political Association to change it from an organization which had a policy of peaceful cooperation with the Government of the United States and a peaceful change within the democratic framework of the United States to one which worked for the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence.","start":696.685,"stop":718.458,"duration":21.77},{"text":"In other words what they said, this Court said here, here are the small group of men who set down, they control the Communist Political Association, this was a lawful organization engaging in rights, in activities protected by the Constitution of the United States and by their control, they changed it to an organization the object of which was to accomplish the forceful overthrow of our Government.","start":718.458,"stop":744.936,"duration":26.48},{"text":"How about the record here?","start":744.936,"stop":747.209,"duration":2.27},{"text":"First of all, there is not one word of evidence to indicate that anyone of the petitioners in this case exercised to any extent the kind of control that the petitioners in Dennis were found to have exercised.","start":747.209,"stop":763.567,"duration":16.36},{"text":"There is no evidence in this case that anyone of them had anything to do with bringing about such a change.","start":763.567,"stop":772.065,"duration":8.5},{"text":"There is no evidence that they denied it.","start":772.065,"stop":775.105,"duration":3.04},{"text":"As a matter of fact as I have pointed out, only four of the individuals were even members of the state committee, of the 11 I represent.","start":775.105,"stop":786.338,"duration":11.23},{"text":"And there is no evidence that the state committee of the Communist Party did anything to change the Communist Political Association from an organization which believe in peaceful advocacy, of peaceful change to one which worked for the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.","start":786.338,"stop":805.229,"duration":18.89},{"text":"Next and this is rather interesting point although I have sometimes been in doubt about its full significance.","start":805.229,"stop":816.282,"duration":11.05},{"text":"The Dennis indictment, the Dennis findings were, that the conspiracy was initiated in 1945 with the reconstitution of the Communist Party.","start":816.282,"stop":827.392,"duration":11.11},{"text":"I want the finding that the Communist Political Association that fourteenth-month period was not a period when any conspiracy as far as that organization was concerned or anything in relation to it was in action.","start":827.392,"stop":844.23,"duration":16.84},{"text":"And as a matter of fact, as I pointed out, that reconstitution of the Communist Party was the key evidence in Dennis.","start":844.23,"stop":852.176,"duration":7.95},{"text":"Here, when the original indictment was returned, it was alleged that the conspiracy began in 1945 on the same date that was alleged in the Dennis case.","start":852.176,"stop":863.496,"duration":11.32},{"text":"That indictment was dismissed because of the failure to allege intent, and a new indictment was returned some months later.","start":863.496,"stop":869.973,"duration":6.48},{"text":"And in that indictment, it was alleged that the conspiracy began in 1940, I don't recall the exact date but it was the date when the Smith Act became effective.","start":869.973,"stop":881.065,"duration":11.09},{"text":"The theory of the respondent apparently be, that the conspiracy was in existence for sometime prior to that date but that it became unlawful upon the Smith Act becoming effective.","start":881.065,"stop":896.562,"duration":15.5},{"text":"In the Dennis case, it was found that Communist Party was a highly disciplined organization.","start":896.562,"stop":904.366,"duration":7.8},{"text":"That the Dennis defendants controlled it and that they would tolerate no dissension from the policies laid down by them, but instead that they insisted that the program be slavishly followed.","start":904.366,"stop":916.81,"duration":12.44},{"text":"I say that there is just no proof of that in this record, just no evidence of it.","start":916.81,"stop":923.388,"duration":6.58},{"text":"As a matter of fact, from respondent's own witnesses, there appears a tremendous amount of evidence concerning many differences of opinion among members of the Communist Parties, considerable dissension on various issues.","start":923.388,"stop":938.261,"duration":14.87},{"text":"It is true that there is evidence showing that the Communist Party exercised this right to expel certain persons from its organization just trade unions and other organizations from time to time exercise the right to expel some of their members.","start":938.261,"stop":960.104,"duration":21.84},{"text":"But the significant thing is the basis for the expulsion.","start":960.104,"stop":966.031,"duration":5.93},{"text":"They were of three kinds.","start":966.031,"stop":968.985,"duration":2.95},{"text":"They were those who wanted to advocate socialism that socialism be established now when a majority of the people was opposed to it, instead of indicating a willingness to wait for advocating the establishment of socialism until such time as it was believed that the American people would want by a majority, by an overwhelming majority to have socialism established.","start":968.985,"stop":994.772,"duration":25.79},{"text":"These people who didn't want to wait were the ones who were expelled.","start":994.772,"stop":1001.079,"duration":6.31},{"text":"Then there were certain informers and spies and their character, I think, has been evidenced by some recent developments before this Court.","start":1001.079,"stop":1011.21,"duration":10.13},{"text":"There were certain informers and spies.","start":1011.21,"stop":1013.954,"duration":2.74},{"text":"They were expelled from this organization as I think they would be expelled from any organization.","start":1013.954,"stop":1019.711,"duration":5.76},{"text":"And finally, there was the expulsion of a person who carried a gun, and who discriminated against Negroes and those were the charges they give.","start":1019.711,"stop":1030.143,"duration":10.43},{"text":"Now if that indicates iron control, then it also indicates the character of the iron control exercise within the Communist Party in California.","start":1030.143,"stop":1044.088,"duration":13.94},{"text":"It was found in Dennis that the petitioners in that case were adept at infiltration into strategic positions.","start":1044.088,"stop":1054.92,"duration":10.83},{"text":"There just no evidence of that here, just none of any adeptness, of any willful infiltration into strategic positions.","start":1054.92,"stop":1065.506,"duration":10.59},{"text":"It was found in Dennis that the petitioners there used aliases in order to cover up their work.","start":1065.506,"stop":1071.523,"duration":6.02},{"text":"There is no such evidence here.","start":1071.523,"stop":1074.867,"duration":3.34},{"text":"It was found in Dennis and this I think is a matter of very great importance.","start":1074.867,"stop":1082.055,"duration":7.19},{"text":"That the petitioners in that case used double meaning language.","start":1082.055,"stop":1089.377,"duration":7.32},{"text":"Now that was predicated upon the testimony of one (Inaudible), who testified that on the basis of his association with the petitioners in that case, he knew that when they talk in favor of peaceful change, they didn't mean it.","start":1089.377,"stop":1116.599,"duration":27.22},{"text":"They meant violence instead.","start":1116.599,"stop":1119.423,"duration":2.82},{"text":"He said he knew them.","start":1119.423,"stop":1120.825,"duration":1.4},{"text":"This was a very important bit of testimony in the reason that it was so important in that case, is that in 1945 when the Communist Party was reconstituted, in 1945 when the Communist Party was reconstituted, it adopted a constitution and that constitution stated that the Party predicated itself upon Marxism-Leninism.","start":1120.825,"stop":1155.138,"duration":34.31},{"text":"And it also stated that it favored the achievement of socialism in the United States through winning a majority of the people to that end.","start":1155.138,"stop":1165.73,"duration":10.59},{"text":"It also adopted provisions for the expulsion from the organization of advocates of force and violence.","start":1165.73,"stop":1173.813,"duration":8.08},{"text":"Now (Inaudible) explained all of these away.","start":1173.813,"stop":1176.747,"duration":2.93},{"text":"He said that was protective coverage.","start":1176.747,"stop":1179.991,"duration":3.24},{"text":"Whether his testimony was truthful or not, it's not before us, but he said this is protective coverage.","start":1179.991,"stop":1184.969,"duration":4.98},{"text":"This people who whined didn't mean this.","start":1184.969,"stop":1188.333,"duration":3.36},{"text":"Marxism-Leninism is the key there.","start":1188.333,"stop":1191.457,"duration":3.12},{"text":"He says, “I know when they used the word Marxism-Leninism, they meant overthrow the Government by force and violence.”","start":1191.457,"stop":1199.616,"duration":8.16},{"text":"And this other language was just been put in there to fool people.","start":1199.616,"stop":1204.802,"duration":5.19},{"text":"There is no such evidence in this case, none whatsoever.","start":1204.802,"stop":1209.427,"duration":4.63},{"text":"There is no evidence insofar as this case is concerned that the Constitution of the Communist Party, when it said that it favored the achievement of socialism by winning the majority to that end, when it indicated, it's our position to advocate force and violence meant anything else to the petitioners than what it said, not one word of evidence.","start":1209.427,"stop":1235.659,"duration":26.23},{"text":"Finally, there was a finding in Dennis that the defendants in that case advocated force and violence by statements and activities of the leaders and by literature.","start":1235.659,"stop":1254.55,"duration":18.89},{"text":"Now, as I will show a little more detail here as much detailed if time will allow, there were no such statements here by any of the petitioners.","start":1254.55,"stop":1264.621,"duration":10.07},{"text":"It is true that the essentially the same Marxist-Leninist books and passages are relied upon in the two cases and to that extent, the two cases are similar.","start":1264.621,"stop":1280.278,"duration":15.66},{"text":"But it is also true that in this case, there is literature of the Communist Party introduced both by the respondent itself and by the defendants in the case indicating that the American Communist Party or at least indicating a position from which it would be possible to conclude very reasonably that the American Communist Party does not favor in fact disposed to the use of force and violence as long as democratic processes are open and as long as our present form of Government exists.","start":1280.278,"stop":1318.361,"duration":38.08},{"text":"And there was an article by Mrs.Yates, the defendant whose name leads all the rest in this case.","start":1318.361,"stop":1327.891,"duration":9.53},{"text":"In which she took issue with a group who recalled the (Inaudible) who were expelled who said, “We want to fight for socialism now”,

that.”","start":1342.231,"stop":1344.814,"duration":2.58},{"text":"There was -- excuse me.","start":1344.814,"stop":1346.076,"duration":1.26}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"I want to
