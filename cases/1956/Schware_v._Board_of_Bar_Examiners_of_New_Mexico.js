proof.","start":171.174,"stop":179.896,"duration":8.72},{"text":"Because in the petition to review the denial of Schware's application, the statement is made that all the questions that were asked in the application length and at the first hearing were answered correctly.","start":179.896,"stop":198.658,"duration":18.76},{"text":"And more importantly, beginning in pages 90 through 92, a defendant

think here we have no question of veracity, no question of burden of proof and the simple issue in the case is whether the three factors has Communist Party membership in the popular front period from 1934 to 1940, the use of aliases for the particular reasons set forth here and the mere fact that this man had been arrested without any consideration again as to whether he was guilty or innocent of crimes, whether these three factors can constitutionally be the basis for a decision barring him from taking the bar examination.","start":253.754,"stop":289.562,"duration":35.81},{"text":"I see that

Levy","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Your Honor.","start":10.386,"stop":16.999,"duration":6.61},{"text":"Yesterday, in the four minutes that I had to argue, I attempted to establish that there was no question here actually of burden of proof in terms of the petitioner's showing of his good moral character that he made below.","start":16.999,"stop":34.879,"duration":17.88},{"text":"I would like to begin today by stressing the affirmative proof in relation to the petitioner that was given by him.","start":34.879,"stop":45.078,"duration":10.2},{"text":"The first and perhaps the most cogent point is that this man was a dupe of the Communist Party, who is duped into joining the Party in 1934 and left it in 1940 when he began to learn what it was all about.","start":45.078,"stop":61.991,"duration":16.91},{"text":"I think a special stress must be laid upon the fact that he testified without contradiction, without any doubt manifested anywhere else, that after he left the Party, he went to the FBI to be of assistance to them in the fight against communism.","start":61.991,"stop":76.739,"duration":14.75},{"text":"In other words, we have the picture of a man who has been an anti-Communist for at least a decade who is now barred from admission to the bar of a court.","start":76.739,"stop":87.682,"duration":10.94},{"text":"Among other reasons, I would say mainly, because of his past membership in the Communist Party.","start":87.682,"stop":94.549,"duration":6.87},{"text":"I think it also deserves note that this man voluntarily admitted that he had once been a member of the Communist Party, going to the dean of the law school, admitting it to him in the very beginning without any request therefore.","start":94.549,"stop":106.986,"duration":12.44},{"text":"I think it should also be noted that he led an honorable life in the Army of the United States and received an honorable discharge.","start":106.986,"stop":115.17,"duration":8.18},{"text":"I think it should further be noted in regard to what the respondent in terms of discrepancy in a number of arrests that he had undergone in California, that this man made a trip halfway across the country to California to find out exactly what the situation was as shown by the records in California.","start":115.17,"stop":133.701,"duration":18.53},{"text":"I think it is also worthy of note that this man presented not merely testimonials and affidavits and letters, but also presented live witnesses including the Rabbi of this Orthodox Jewish Synagogue, who testified as to his very high opinion of the petitioner.","start":133.701,"stop":151.796,"duration":18.1},{"text":"He presented the dean's secretary, who knew him fairly intimately, she said.","start":151.796,"stop":155.739,"duration":3.94},{"text":"And she testified too as to her very high opinion.","start":155.739,"stop":158.818,"duration":3.08},{"text":"And the blind student, whom Schware had helped in law school over and above the call of duty, also testified as to his fine moral character.","start":158.818,"stop":166.97,"duration":8.15},{"text":"This is in addition to the other point such as his conversion to religion, his establishing an anonymous scholarship for indigent students at the law school, letters of recommendation from virtually everybody there, etcetera, etcetera.","start":166.97,"stop":182.4,"duration":15.43},{"text":"In terms, again, of the letters that he presented showing his high moral character, the respondent has raised some questions as to the lack of enthusiasm, so-called lack of enthusiasm in some of the letters which was submitted.","start":182.4,"stop":200.956,"duration":18.56},{"text":"However, in other letters, which he of course does not advert to, I'm referring now to page 85 of the record, we find one person, Mr. Martinez testifying that, “Schware's moral character in my opinion is far and beyond the highest standard of any person I have ever come in contact with.”","start":200.956,"stop":218.489,"duration":17.53},{"text":"And then, on the next page 86 at the bottom, another person testifies that Schware is a person of the highest and best moral character.","start":218.489,"stop":226.715,"duration":8.23},{"text":"And at the bottom of 87, another person testifies, “That I know Mr. Schware to be open-handed charitable towards others and scrupulously honest in every situation.","start":226.715,"stop":236.498,"duration":9.78},{"text":"Were he to represent me, I should have every confidence in his integrity.”","start":236.498,"stop":240.72,"duration":4.22},{"text":"And again, on page 88, another person says in the center of the page, “That I find him trustworthy, honest and his character to my estimation is above reproach.”","start":240.72,"stop":250.342,"duration":9.62},{"text":"So that I think we have here a case where whatever burden of proof there may have been as to his good moral character, Mr. Schware has sustained it more than admirably if ever there was a -- shall I call it a super prima facie case, I think this was it.","start":250.342,"stop":270.004,"duration":19.66},{"text":"The record also shows that Mr. Schware had been an idealist all his life, that he joined the party for idealistic reasons.","start":270.004,"stop":276.712,"duration":6.71},{"text":"But when he found that this god had failed him, so many others had found in the past, he left the Party.","start":276.712,"stop":283.191,"duration":6.48},{"text":"He himself was the person who furnished all the derogatory information against him.","start":283.191,"stop":288.634,"duration":5.44},{"text":"He concealed nothing.","start":288.634,"stop":290.354,"duration":1.72},{"text":"He refused to answer no question.","start":290.354,"stop":293.668,"duration":3.31},{"text":"I think it's also worthy of note that exactly the same decision in regard to his case was made by the Board of Bar Examiners before and after Mr. Schware introduced his affirmative evidence.","start":293.668,"stop":304.925,"duration":11.26},{"text":"In other words, the affirmative evidence apparently had no effect.","start":304.925,"stop":309.673,"duration":4.75},{"text":"There is nothing in this record at all to show that anywhere in his whole life had Mr. Schware ever done anything indicating bad moral character.","start":309.673,"stop":319.816,"duration":10.14},{"text":"From my examination of the record, I think I can state that he had never violated the code of honesty, the code of morality, or the code of good social conduct.","start":319.816,"stop":328.145,"duration":8.33}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"As to the point of

really a question of the standards they used.","start":365.674,"stop":369.74,"duration":4.07},{"text":"The Court said at page 109 that its standard was of good moral character and I quote now from the top of the page.","start":369.74,"stop":378.347,"duration":8.61},{"text":"“They must consider two kinds of indirect evidence.","start":378.347,"stop":381.448,"duration":3.1},{"text":"First, the pattern of conduct an individual follows.","start":381.448,"stop":384.55,"duration":3.1},{"text":"And second, the consideration of the regard his fellows and associates have for him.”","start":384.55,"stop":389.212,"duration":4.66},{"text":"As to the pattern of conduct an individual follows, using the present tense, there is nothing which anyone could and I am sure there is nothing that the respondents contend, which had been reprehensible during the 15 years prior to the application for admission.","start":389.212,"stop":407.026,"duration":17.81},{"text":"The Court actually just adverted very briefly in one-half of a page to this very fine record that Mr. Schware have had and they nowhere has related it to his present moral character.","start":407.026,"stop":421.722,"duration":14.7},{"text":"In regard to the second standard that they used, the consideration of the regard his fellows and associates have for him, at page 125, the Court said and I quote from the last paragraph.","start":421.722,"stop":438.566,"duration":16.84},{"text":"“The record on which this -- second sentence, “The record on which this decision is based came from the petitioner himself, who presently enjoys good repute among his teachers, his fellow students, and associates and in his synagogue.”","start":438.566,"stop":450.866,"duration":12.3},{"text":"So that is to the second criterion that the court used below, they obviously -- Schware had sustained that burden of proof.","start":450.866,"stop":458.547,"duration":7.68},{"text":"As to the pattern of conduct he follows, the Court nowhere has considered the conduct of the past 15 years and rested its decision entirely upon the basis of pre-1940 conduct.","start":458.547,"stop":474.153,"duration":15.61},{"text":"The burden of proof, by the way, is mentioned aside from that -- the use of the word on page 190 -- 109, comes up again only at pages 126, which is the tail end of the first opinion.","start":474.153,"stop":490.625,"duration":16.47},{"text":"And again, in page 150, in both of those cases, they took the question of good moral character is related solely to the question of past membership in the Communist Party and use of aliases, and the fact that there had been arrest.","start":490.625,"stop":506.521,"duration":15.9},{"text":"There is no question raised anywhere as in the opinion as to good moral character in any other way, shape, or form.","start":506.521,"stop":517.436,"duration":10.92},{"text":"The testimony, I think I showed yesterday of the petitioner and his witnesses was all

at all was the fact that he had given an additional reason for using an alias at one particular point, plus the fact that Schware could not account for his addresses and employments during a particular period about 20 years previously.","start":526.807,"stop":548.839,"duration":22.03},{"text":"And though the Court adverted to that, they did not rely upon that at all.","start":548.839,"stop":553.602,"duration":4.76},{"text":"They said that were it not -- they said that this would be devoid of explanation where it not for the fact that Schware led such a peripatetic existence.","start":553.602,"stop":562.802,"duration":9.2},{"text":"But having led that existence, they felt there was certainly a reason explaining why he could not account for these particular times.","start":562.802,"stop":572.816,"duration":10.01},{"text":"I might also add that -- or reiterate perhaps that the failure, the inability to account for certain periods of time with regard to employment and addresses was mentioned in Schware's application blank.","start":572.816,"stop":588.445,"duration":15.63},{"text":"And again, to mention again what I said yesterday, the respondent said that at no time had they ever raised the contention that Schware's answers were anything but full, true and complete.","start":588.445,"stop":603.807,"duration":15.36},{"text":"As they

central.","start":629.517,"stop":641.425,"duration":11.91},{"text":"I think it must be remembered that the use of aliases and the fact of arrest had been disclosed in the application to take the bar examination.","start":641.425,"stop":651.015,"duration":9.59},{"text":"Despite that disclosure, we find that the petitioner was advised that he was entitled to take the bar examination.That is alleged
