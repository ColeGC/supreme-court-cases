$42,000.","start":240.323,"stop":260.035,"duration":19.71},{"text":"The District Attorney and the Attorney General on the recommendation of a coroner and a committee reached the conclusion that I was

that went to the Supreme Court on the appeal of the Attorney General, it was a great feeling in my case for some reason or other.","start":357.972,"stop":370.315,"duration":12.34},{"text":"And the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that my plea of limitations was well founded.","start":370.315,"stop":381.275,"duration":10.96},{"text":"In that decision, which was rendered in 1948 -- remember, I had already have been sick and whatnot since 1936, even since 1935 when I left the school.","start":381.275,"stop":396.545,"duration":15.27},{"text":"That decision became quite important as I appreciate it because it's all mentioned in the brief because there was the question of prescription or the statute of limitations in the argument that we made that the prescription was well founded in the counter argument made by the authorities that they haven't been able to prosecute me because of my illness.","start":396.545,"stop":425.378,"duration":28.83},{"text":"And then, this important question

prosecuted.","start":425.378,"stop":446.069,"duration":20.69},{"text":"Whether that fact had interrupted the prescription, destroyed where it had gone before, so that it will have to start all over again, or whether it had merely suspended the prescription during the period of enforced inaction on the part of the State.","start":446.069,"stop":462.623,"duration":16.55},{"text":"And the Supreme Court in the unanimous case on this plea of prescription held, \"The question was new and had never heard of or raised by anybody.\"","start":462.623,"stop":475.952,"duration":13.33},{"text":"They could find no case in point and they had to decide it as they said, at 212 Louisiana.","start":475.952,"stop":484.083,"duration":8.13},{"text":"According to their sense of justice, and they decided in so many words that since the inability to prosecute me in that criminal action then 11 or 12 years old, had not been due to any act on my part to nothing willful, to know misconduct.","start":484.083,"stop":510.552,"duration":26.47},{"text":"But since on the contrary and these are the words of the Court, “If the act, a situation was neither deliberate nor intentional,”

prescription had been suspended and not interrupted.","start":510.552,"stop":540.669,"duration":30.12},{"text":"Of course, that was the end of that particular case.","start":540.669,"stop":546.087,"duration":5.42},{"text":"Now, there had been only two cases against me that I've just told Your Honors.","start":546.087,"stop":550.831,"duration":4.74},{"text":"This first case which I won before the jury and this other case which they had been holding back for 10 years in a hope of being able

offense.","start":562.771,"stop":572.191,"duration":9.42},{"text":"My mental condition required this hospitalization for 10 years, running into from roughly a little over 10 years, running from 1936

well.","start":588.56,"stop":589.963,"duration":1.4},{"text":"I think everybody else in the City of New Orleans knew that I was well, although I had been always institutionalized.","start":589.963,"stop":596.914,"duration":6.95},{"text":"I was never out of an institution from 1936 to 1947.","start":596.914,"stop":604.578,"duration":7.66},{"text":"Shortly thereafter, the committee proceeding which had been held against me which we call interdiction in Louisiana was lifted at a regular contested hearing of the probate court which -- with our civil district court which handles those matters.","start":604.578,"stop":624.13,"duration":19.55},{"text":"And in 1948, no charges against me whatever, being perfectly well having gone through 10 years of care and treatment and having been completely restored to health, I undertook to begin again the practice of civil law.","start":624.13,"stop":651.843,"duration":27.71},{"text":"I must say that my

think.","start":662.085,"stop":665.021,"duration":2.94},{"text":"Old clients flocked to me and for six years without a word of complaint -- or for four years without a word of complaint from the Bar Association.","start":665.021,"stop":677.946,"duration":12.93},{"text":"And for six years concurrently with no objection from anyone, any lawyer, any opponent, any member of the public, I undertook

committed on -- as they say, I have no recollection of it, on the 2nd of January 1935.","start":703.715,"stop":748.456,"duration":44.74},{"text":"In June 1952, the Bar Association, which is a prosecuting unit for disbarment in Louisiana, brought a disbarment suit against me, nothing having made in examination, preliminary examination.","start":748.456,"stop":768.521,"duration":20.06},{"text":"I went on practicing law because as I tell you, the period of my activity was from 1936 to 1954.","start":768.521,"stop":776.79,"duration":8.27},{"text":"It only stopped when there was a final decree of disbarment against me in the state court.","start":776.79,"stop":783.98,"duration":7.19},{"text":"During which time as I say, I've tried 37 hardly contested cases which are all in the books and which I have tried alone.","start":783.98,"stop":793.21,"duration":9.23},{"text":"I have had associates, but I'm not in the habit of shaking work or turning it over to other

original jurisdiction of our Supreme Court.","start":837.063,"stop":850.538,"duration":13.48},{"text":"The Supreme Court doesn't actually try disbarment cases.","start":850.538,"stop":855.29,"duration":4.75},{"text":"It takes a complaint from a bar committee, we have an Integrated Bar.","start":855.29,"stop":863.984,"duration":8.69},{"text":"And of

any lack of procedure of due process.","start":863.984,"stop":882.435,"duration":18.45},{"text":"I've got plenty opportunity to defend myself.","start":882.435,"stop":885.991,"duration":3.56},{"text":"What I claim is a lack of substantive due process for the reasons which I would just -- would mention in just a moment.","start":885.991,"stop":893.707,"duration":7.72},{"text":"I -- the -- in accordance with the rules applying in that case, the matter was referred to a Commissioner and the testimony was taken before it.","start":893.707,"stop":907.265,"duration":13.56},{"text":"All I could testify to was that I had signed the documents that they showed me.","start":907.265,"stop":915.549,"duration":8.28},{"text":"I admitted that they were my signature.","start":915.549,"stop":917.568,"duration":2.02},{"text":"I couldn't remember why or under what circumstances.","start":917.568,"stop":921.42,"duration":3.85},{"text":"Remember, this was already 18 years since 1935, but then it come into period of my illness.","start":921.42,"stop":928.305,"duration":6.88},{"text":"In the same period of time referred to by the Supreme Court and holding in the case in the 212, that they must take into consideration the fact that whatever I had done was not deliberate or intentional but the result of what they call a -- a condition over which I had no control.","start":928.305,"stop":951.915,"duration":23.61},{"text":"The Commissioner or the Bar Association was quite vehement.","start":951.915,"stop":958.182,"duration":6.27},{"text":"They've always been very aggressive in my case and they protested that this was a criminal act and they continued to protest and have always protested.","start":958.182,"stop":971.976,"duration":13.79},{"text":"They've had to protest because they lost the suit as I appreciate it in this -- although I was disbarred by the state court, they lost the suit.","start":971.976,"stop":980.413,"duration":8.44},{"text":"The report of the Commissioner was that unquestionably, I was suffering from some kind of insanity or lack of mental control.","start":980.413,"stop":992.751,"duration":12.34},{"text":"And then under our practice, exceptions were filed to the report of the Commissioner and the matter was argued on these exceptions before the Supreme Court of the State.","start":992.751,"stop":1008.39,"duration":15.64},{"text":"The Supreme Court of the State held that -- apparently, that my insanity had been proved.","start":1008.39,"stop":1019.979,"duration":11.59},{"text":"They put it in this way.","start":1019.979,"stop":1021.229,"duration":1.25},{"text":"They said, “We don't think insanity is a defense, but we will concede it.","start":1021.229,"stop":1027.507,"duration":6.28},{"text":"We will concede it for the purpose of this discussion or for the purpose of this decision,” as I say.","start":1027.507,"stop":1036.054,"duration":8.55},{"text":"And therefore, we -- we will disbar Theard.","start":1036.054,"stop":1043.77,"duration":7.72},{"text":"And then, to emphasize if it was possible to emphasize the fact that they went out finding me guilty of any criminal act, they took up the exception which had been filed to the master's report by the bar committee and they said, “The bar committee who separates that the Master made a report that Theard was guilty of a criminal act, that the way he wrote that shows that in 1935.","start":1043.77,"stop":1076.148,"duration":32.38},{"text":"He was guilty of a criminal act.”","start":1076.148,"stop":1078.495,"duration":2.35},{"text":"And we accept to the Master's report and the Supreme Court said, “Under the view that we have taken over the matter, we are conceding the insanity.”","start":1078.495,"stop":1090.824,"duration":12.33},{"text":"Under the view that we have taken here the matter, we don't have to consider this charge of criminality which I think was a loss of the case by the Committee which knew that there was something fatally wrong with the decree of disbarment based on an insane act which was conceded by the Court which decreed the disbarment, but which decreed the disbarment just the same.","start":1090.824,"stop":1115.528,"duration":24.7},{"text":"Now, because it was conceded by it, I say as the basis for the disbarment excluding specifically all other claims made in that case.","start":1115.528,"stop":1129.103,"duration":13.58},{"text":"Now, that was particularly distressing I think and perhaps say in with respect, particularly wrong because the Constitution of Louisiana which as I have just told you, controls disbarment absolutely, and vest it with the Supreme Court also provides in so many words.","start":1129.103,"stop":1155.59,"duration":26.49},{"text":"And that's the history of a law or condition which arose through the years and goes back 60 years, that the Court is vested with jurisdiction for disbarment in cases of misconduct.","start":1155.59,"stop":1175.347,"duration":19.76},{"text":"I say and I think anyone would agree that under that constitutional fiat, there can be no -- no disbarment in Louisiana and there should be no disbarment in Louisiana and there can be no disbarment in Louisiana except for the cause set forth, namely, misconduct.","start":1175.347,"stop":1199.644,"duration":24.3},{"text":"The rules of the Court and the rules of the integrated bar association which has been made the rules of the Court by an order of the Court, go further and say that the lawyer shall be disbarred who is guilty, of course I couldn't say of anything in contravention of the Constitution, but they make it I think a little stronger because they say and it's all quoted in the brief.","start":1199.644,"stop":1227.901,"duration":28.26},{"text":"That disbarment will be -- will result from the willful misconduct of an attorney.","start":1227.901,"stop":1237.027,"duration":9.13},{"text":"Now, how does the Supreme Court could hold that I should be disbarred because -- or despite the fact that I was insane and not from any other cause where the only cause under the Constitution should have been misconduct, more than I can say.","start":1237.027,"stop":1257.136,"duration":20.11},{"text":"Now, Your Honors would say that this is not an appeal from the decree of the state court, no, but immediately after the Supreme Court had rendered this judgment in 1954.","start":1257.136,"stop":1269.761,"duration":12.63},{"text":"I prayed for a rehearing which had been refused.","start":1269.761,"stop":1272.925,"duration":3.16},{"text":"I have done everything

could have disbarred me for any -- any kind of act that he thought was -- which involved justification, but he chose to bring a suit for my disbarment in the federal court based exclusively on this judgment, exclusively on this judgment which said that eliminating all other causes, I should be disbarred because I was sick.","start":1289.883,"stop":1320.829,"duration":30.95},{"text":"So, I raised several defenses.","start":1320.829,"stop":1324.897,"duration":4.07},{"text":"This is a proceeding that went to the Court of Appeals and that comes
