conclusion on two grounds.","start":380.537,"stop":386.852,"duration":6.31},{"text":"First, it concluded that the strike against Frontier was tantamount to a withdraw by the Union from the multi-employer bargaining relationship which had existed for some 13 years.","start":386.852,"stop":401.067,"duration":14.22},{"text":"On that premise, the Court said there was no basis for differentiating between an individual employer and an employer who is the member of an association that, in either case, where an employer suspends operations in anticipation of a strike, he is engaging an unfair labor practice within the meaning of the federal -- of the National Labor Relations Act.","start":401.067,"stop":422.397,"duration":21.33},{"text":"Secondly, the Court, meeting the Board upon its own ground, concluded that the employers' interest in preserving their solidarity and preserving their bargaining position as against the Union was not -- has not been given -- given a

Board.","start":447.289,"stop":459.959,"duration":12.67},{"text":"Now, at the outset, I think, in order to understand more clearly the issue which is involved in this case, I think it is important to deal with the initial premise of the decision below, namely, that the strike called by the Union against the Frontier Company was tantamount to a withdrawal by the Union from the multi-employer bargaining relationship with the employers, and that on that basis, this -- the lockout here was not to be differentiated from a lockout by an individual employer who is not a member of an association

statute.","start":535.139,"stop":556.096,"duration":20.96},{"text":"The record in this case shows that after the Union called the strike against Frontier, it continued to negotiate with the

group.","start":624.93,"stop":648.999,"duration":24.07},{"text":"Now, the issue, therefore, as we see it in this case is whether a union which has been bargaining upon this basis may squeeze the

employers.","start":648.999,"stop":675.139,"duration":26.14},{"text":"Now, the Board, originally, on this issue in the Morand case held that it was an unfair labor practice for the employers to

in preserving their bargaining position, in preserving the integrity of the -- of their multi-employer bargaining relationship and interest which I -- so later show, we think, that the statute recognizes as one entitled to protection and, as they say, in accommodation between that interest and on the other hand the employees right to strike which, of course, the statute also
