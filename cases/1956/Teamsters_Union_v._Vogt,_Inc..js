coerce him in violation of state law and, therefore, the picketing was unlawfully purposed.","start":370.199,"stop":401.669,"duration":31.47},{"text":"It was also charged that the picketing was

his employees and a further statute which says that unless there is a labor dispute as so defined, picketing is unlawful.","start":401.669,"stop":428.841,"duration":27.17},{"text":"The Union denied

union contracts.","start":432.601,"stop":442.241,"duration":9.64},{"text":"They asserted the desirability of inducing these employees to join their union for the purpose of protecting their standards, and they asserted the unconstitutionality of the Wisconsin statute which was invoked defining a labor dispute and prohibiting picketing unless pursuant to a dispute so defined and asserted also that any restraining order or injunction which might be entered under these factual circumstances would deprive them of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment conjoined with the First Amendment.","start":442.241,"stop":473.516,"duration":31.28},{"text":"In the circuit court, or what would ordinarily be the trial court, in view of the allegations of the complaint and the admissions of the petitioners here, there was no evidence taken.","start":473.516,"stop":488.433,"duration":14.92},{"text":"The Court made its decision based upon those uncontroverted facts.","start":488.433,"stop":493.52,"duration":5.09},{"text":"It found, number one, that there was no unlawful purpose.","start":493.52,"stop":499.466,"duration":5.95},{"text":"It found, number two, that there was a purpose to organize the employees who did not belong to the union, said, as a matter of fact, to induce the plaintiff's employees to organize and affiliate with the unions.","start":499.466,"stop":516.035,"duration":16.57},{"text":"It found that to be the purpose.","start":516.035,"stop":518.581,"duration":2.55},{"text":"However, it felt that it was bound by the Wisconsin statutory scheme of prohibiting picketing unless the picketing was pursuant to a dispute between a majority of the employees and the employer.","start":518.581,"stop":535.534,"duration":16.95},{"text":"So, it found the picketing unlawful, under the statute which I've alluded to, and entered a temporary injunction restraining the picketing.","start":535.534,"stop":545.639,"duration":10.11},{"text":"The parties there upon stipulated that the record contained all of the facts that would be adduced in Court on the merits.","start":545.639,"stop":554.498,"duration":8.86},{"text":"And, on such stipulation, the Court then entered its permanent injunction making, again, the same findings of facts and the same conclusions of law.","start":554.498,"stop":567.778,"duration":13.28},{"text":"From that point, the unions took an appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and because the holding of the Wisconsin Supreme Court initially is pertinent to these proceedings with the leave of court.","start":567.778,"stop":582.125,"duration":14.35},{"text":"I would like to quote this one flat unequivocal finding of the Wisconsin Court in the first decision.","start":582.125,"stop":589.967,"duration":7.84},{"text":"The Court said, “The testimony would not have supported a finding of the facts constituting a
