under it.","start":534.266,"stop":550.501,"duration":16.24},{"text":"This Court said so in the cases.","start":550.501,"stop":554.621,"duration":4.12},{"text":"As a matter of fact, this Court itself

the legislative history of the Act, referring to the National Labor Relations Act, those hardly indicate that the purpose of the statute was to compel employers to bargain collectively with their employees to the end that employment contracts binding on both parties should be made.","start":566.877,"stop":587.103,"duration":20.23},{"text":"This Court in 1939 was satisfied that that was an appropriate characterization.","start":587.103,"stop":593.119,"duration":6.02},{"text":"And we submit that, of course, it is.","start":593.119,"stop":596.889,"duration":3.77},{"text":"Now, it won't do to say that all Mr. (Inaudible) was bothered about was the individual hiring.","start":596.889,"stop":606.689,"duration":9.8},{"text":"He specifically adverted to what would happen if a union made a contract.","start":606.689,"stop":614.212,"duration":7.52},{"text":"And in the very analysis of the bill referred to in the -- the same as union convention, in his analysis of the bill he points out and I refer to the extracts from his analysis printed at page 46 of the respondent's brief in this case.","start":614.212,"stop":633.051,"duration":18.84},{"text":"He said, “What about those who seek to protect themselves through mutual aid?”","start":633.051,"stop":638.738,"duration":5.69},{"text":"Some organizations are very strong and a union may enter a contract.","start":638.738,"stop":644.784,"duration":6.05},{"text":"If they show into an -- into an agreement containing an arbitration clause there can be little doubt that the organization will be bound, but would such action bind the members?\"","start":644.784,"stop":654.386,"duration":9.6},{"text":"And he concludes that it would.","start":654.386,"stop":657.148,"duration":2.76},{"text":"And indeed that was argued this morning and as I think I must fully agree with him.","start":657.148,"stop":662.474,"duration":5.33},{"text":"And as the courts have consistently held the provisions in a collective-bargaining agreement with respect to grievance procedure and arbitration are binding on the individual employee.","start":662.474,"stop":678.84,"duration":16.37},{"text":"What good would it have done -- have done therefore?","start":678.84,"stop":681.972,"duration":3.13},{"text":"Would Mr. Feller's set purpose have been accomplished if all that was excluded from the Act was an arbitration clause in the rare end where there was an individual contract of hire, but it was not excluded when it was included in the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement.","start":681.972,"stop":701.659,"duration":19.69},{"text":"It seems to me perfectly plain, therefore, that to give any effect to that proviso it must apply to the arbitration clause whether in a collective-bargaining agreement or in the rare case of an individual contract it had such as in the Shipping Act.","start":701.659,"stop":720.417,"duration":18.76},{"text":"Now then, it maybe said that although the collective bargaining agreement is a contract of employment, it is not a contract of employment of a seaman, a worker engaged in commerce in this case.","start":720.417,"stop":743.264,"duration":22.85},{"text":"In our case, we have production and maintenance employees.","start":743.264,"stop":747.933,"duration":4.67},{"text":"And some courts have said that the only collective-bargaining agreements which are excluded -- arbitration clause which are excluded are those relating to transportation workers, persons engaged in commerce.","start":747.933,"stop":762.137,"duration":14.2},{"text":"That is to say, therefore, that what Congress intended to do was to provide for the nonarbitrability of collective-bargaining agreements with respect to workers engaged in commerce but to leave open and subject to arbitrability the collective-bargaining agreements of workers who are engaged in industries affecting commerce or producing goods for commerce.","start":762.137,"stop":788.361,"duration":26.22},{"text":"There is not the slightest suggestion in the legislative history or any place else or as to why that distinction should be done.","start":788.361,"stop":797.61,"duration":9.25},{"text":"So that we submit that clearly this agreement is a contract of employment and a contract of employment which is therefore excluded from the Arbitration Act.","start":797.61,"stop":812.367,"duration":14.76},{"text":"Now then, Congress, therefore, in the Arbitration Act made up its mind that it was not going to provide for the enforcement of labor contracts -- enforcement of arbitration in labor contracts.","start":812.367,"stop":833.366,"duration":21},{"text":"Commercial arbitration, yes, but for reasons of policy it decided against making specifically enforceable provisions in a labor contract, a contract relating to the employment of individuals.","start":833.366,"stop":849.573,"duration":16.21},{"text":"That was the position it took in 1925.","start":849.573,"stop":855.472,"duration":5.9},{"text":"It is said that it reversed that position, in 1947, in enacting the Taft-Hartley Act.","start":855.472,"stop":864.517,"duration":9.05},{"text":"And that it did so.","start":864.517,"stop":866.473,"duration":1.96},{"text":"Although it used no words to that effect and although we submit a fair reading of the legislative history shows that it had no such intention.","start":866.473,"stop":875.195,"duration":8.72},{"text":"Now, Congress knew how to provide for arbitration, how to provide for methods of compelling arbitration if it wanted to.","start":875.195,"stop":885.681,"duration":10.49},{"text":"The 1925 Arbitration Act shows that it knew how to do it if it wanted to.","start":885.681,"stop":890.919,"duration":5.24},{"text":"The amendments to the Railway Labor Act which this Court considered in its opinion of yesterday in the Brotherhood case showed that Congress knew how to do it when it wanted to.","start":890.919,"stop":900.627,"duration":9.71},{"text":"In that Act, for example, with respect to minor disputes it set up a procedure under which both parties had to go to arbitration.","start":900.627,"stop":910.245,"duration":9.62},{"text":"When it came to major disputes on the other hand, it was very careful to say that this shall remain voluntary and neither party is obligated to do so.","start":910.245,"stop":918.422,"duration":8.18},{"text":"It knew how to deal with an arbitration question if it wanted to.","start":918.422,"stop":923.31,"duration":4.89},{"text":"So, we come then to the provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act.","start":923.31,"stop":928.908,"duration":5.6},{"text":"And do they change the situation?","start":928.908,"stop":932.341,"duration":3.43},{"text":"Now, you certainly don't find anything in the language of the Act that suggests, in anyway, that Congress was now for the first time deciding as a matter of policy that arbitration under labor agreements should be enforced when it had decided in 1925 that they should not be enforced.","start":932.341,"stop":952.401,"duration":20.06},{"text":"What is the language?","start":952.401,"stop":955.942,"duration":3.54},{"text":"Suits for violation of

enforcement of arbitration clause.","start":1013.755,"stop":1022.129,"duration":8.37},{"text":"I think the fair reading of the majority report and the minority report shows clearly that there was no

301?","start":1034.8,"stop":1040.755,"duration":5.96},{"text":"It was faced with the -- as the reports say again and again, it was faced with the procedural difficulties of employers suing
