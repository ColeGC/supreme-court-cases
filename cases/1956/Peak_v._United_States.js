complaint that presumption of death took effect on the 5th of July, 1950.","start":93.976,"stop":106.755,"duration":12.78},{"text":"Sometime thereafter, Mrs. Peak, Leona Peak, the mother and the beneficiary of the policy applied to the Veterans Administration for the benefits of the policy and that was denied.","start":106.755,"stop":121.915,"duration":15.16},{"text":"And she then filed a suit in the complaint that's charged that he was suffering from chorea, nervousness, general disability, and weakness, despondency and St. Vitus Dance and that he was home loving, devoted to his parents to his only sister that he communicated with them regularly and that they had a letter dated, the 30th of July 1943, and no intelligent or tidings from him since and that in his disabled

considered in applying to the Veterans Administration for the benefits of the policy that she did that.","start":172.513,"stop":200.967,"duration":28.45},{"text":"It's also alleged in the declaration

paid.","start":232.345,"stop":258.873,"duration":26.53},{"text":"Now, the Government's plea to the complaint filed by Mrs. Peak was to dismiss first because of lack of jurisdiction in the United

complaint.","start":273.033,"stop":283.977,"duration":10.94},{"text":"And the District Judge construed Section 810 of the Title 38 of the code that was for the purpose, we think, to make uniform throughout the United States, the law with respect to -- in National Service Life Insurance policies that the death couldn't take effect under that statute or be construed to except at the end of the seven-year period.","start":283.977,"stop":318.001,"duration":34.02},{"text":"It is our insistence that -- that statute didn't undertake to repeal and didn't repeal the English common

asked, we, as now alleged in the complaint to accept that he disappeared on the 30th of July.","start":376.111,"stop":386,"duration":9.89},{"text":"My understanding is that soldiers at that time recruits were paid $75,000 a month.","start":386,"stop":393.738,"duration":7.74},{"text":"He would have earned nearly $75,000, say $72,000, and therefore, the policy usually cost about $6 that would

that are stated here.","start":410.397,"stop":420.476,"duration":10.08},{"text":"Now, the District Judge didn't pass it all upon that question of the statute of limitations of six years.","start":420.476,"stop":429.836,"duration":9.36},{"text":"Here, it was charged in the petition that the statute of limitations was told during the seven years for waiting to see whether he was dead and whether the presumption would ever take effect.","start":429.836,"stop":446.943,"duration":17.11},{"text":"And it went from the District Court to the Circuit Court of Appeals and the Circuit Court Appeals doesn't seem to withheld with Judge Darrah and correct in -- his interpretation of Section 810 of the Title 38.","start":446.943,"stop":469.901,"duration":22.96},{"text":"They say that the complaint doesn't state cause of action, circumstances sufficient to justify a court or jury in finding and holding that he did die about July the 30th.","start":469.901,"stop":488.239,"duration":18.34},{"text":"They say that it has to take some impending -- be exposed to some impending danger or some impending disaster searches in Davie versus Briggs that's decided, I believe, in 85 U.S. by this Court.","start":488.239,"stop":510.102,"duration":21.86},{"text":"And we cite cases from the Fifth Circuit and from the Fourth Circuit that are contrary to the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals.","start":510.102,"stop":523.957,"duration":13.86},{"text":"And in fact in the case of -- one case that we've cite that's the -- that's the case

308.","start":571.28,"stop":595.746,"duration":24.47},{"text":"And then, in that case, it was declared that the inference of death might arise from the disappearance inconsistent with the continuance of life even though exposed to the some particular peril is not shown.","start":595.746,"stop":610.346,"duration":14.6},{"text":"Now, the Circuit Court of Appeals in its opinion which is cited in the

this Court had proved it and cited the case of Davie versus Briggs.","start":671.971,"stop":681.371,"duration":9.4},{"text":"Now, in Davie versus Briggs, it was on North Carolina land case and the complainants contended that the man that had disappeared, Allen Jones Davie, had -- had died at the end of the seven-year period.","start":681.371,"stop":702.974,"duration":21.6},{"text":"It changed the statute of limitations on the suit there, but this Court held that he had died in 1851.","start":702.974,"stop":714.15,"duration":11.18},{"text":"Now, he was on a tour from North Carolina through the Indian Territory seeking the road of California.","start":714.15,"stop":722.641,"duration":8.49},{"text":"And after he had reached the Indian Territory, he was never heard of

the time of his death.","start":747.892,"stop":751.22,"duration":3.33},{"text":"And then the Court went on, we therefore, follow the established law when we inquire whether according to the evidence,

us that upon the showing made by the complainants themselves that conclusion is inevitable that he died some time during year 1951.","start":768.762,"stop":780.685,"duration":11.92},{"text":"The most
