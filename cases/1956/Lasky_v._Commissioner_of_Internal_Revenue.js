case.","start":130.74,"stop":141.336,"duration":10.6},{"text":"The case obviously was a close and difficult one because the Tax Court judge took approximately two years and four months to promulgate the findings of fact and opinion.","start":141.336,"stop":156.802,"duration":15.47},{"text":"Now, they were promulgated on April the 8th, 1954.","start":156.802,"stop":163.46,"duration":6.66},{"text":"On the same date, the Tax Court entered its decisions based on the findings of fact and opinion and mailed copies to the first counsel of

time to time, he inquired counsel about the status of his case.","start":245.751,"stop":250.611,"duration":4.86},{"text":"He was informed each time that the decisions had not been received, that he

case.","start":295.795,"stop":298.46,"duration":2.66},{"text":"I felt that immediate action was necessary and know I knew little of the facts.","start":298.46,"stop":303.27,"duration":4.81},{"text":"Immediately, on August 24, 1954, I filed a motion for leave to file a motion to vacate the decision out of time, and the motion to vacate

on the merits.","start":317.244,"stop":327.902,"duration":10.66},{"text":"Well, this -- the Government's brief says that our motion for rehearing was an afterthought because that made until several months after the original findings of fact decision.","start":327.902,"stop":337.55,"duration":9.65},{"text":"Now, the truth is that as soon as I am running the facts, it was evident to me that Lasky had a meritorious case and the justice demanded a new trial.","start":337.55,"stop":346.913,"duration":9.36},{"text":"On December the 13th, 1954, Judge Harron of the Tax Court granted our motion and set the case for further hearing in January of 1955.","start":346.913,"stop":357.354,"duration":10.44},{"text":"The case was reheard in

Harron.","start":375.044,"stop":379.892,"duration":4.85},{"text":"However, she -- although she made additional findings, she reached the same conclusion that she had reached at the first trial.","start":379.892,"stop":388.654,"duration":8.76},{"text":"We appealed to the Ninth Circuit.","start":388.654,"stop":391.656,"duration":3},{"text":"That Court dismissed the appeal on the ground

the position that although a Tax Court for purposes of housing keeping is designated as an independent agency in the executive branch of the Government, it is in fact a court.","start":403.759,"stop":415.85,"duration":12.09},{"text":"The Government in its brief, at page 16, admits that this is true.","start":415.85,"stop":420.608,"duration":4.76},{"text":"As a Court, we say that it has the inherent power of any trial court within its discretion to vacate decisions out of time.","start":420.608,"stop":429.31,"duration":8.7},{"text":"Now, the -- we have authority for this position in the Reo Motor case which is on all fours practically with our case.","start":429.31,"stop":437.263,"duration":7.95},{"text":"That case went all the way to this Court.","start":437.263,"stop":440.008,"duration":2.75},{"text":"After the decision became final, the taxpayer asked leave of the Tax Court to file a motion to vacate the decision.","start":440.008,"stop":446.912,"duration":6.9},{"text":"The reason was, the stipulation -- stipulation of facts upon which the Tax Court originally decided the case contained a mistake of fact which resulted in an omission from invested capital of over $2 million.","start":446.912,"stop":459.743,"duration":12.83},{"text":"The Tax Court denied the motion but the Sixth Circuit reversed.","start":459.743,"stop":465.889,"duration":6.15},{"text":"The reasoning of the Sixth Circuit is set forth at page 17 of our original
