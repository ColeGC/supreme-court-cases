that runs through this Court's 16(b) jurisprudence, it's that precisely because the -- Section 16(b) is prophylactic, it should be interpreted in a literal and mechanical way.","start":3198.234,"stop":3209.54,"duration":11.31},{"text":"I think the -- that argues for repose, because you don't get into a lot of these questions about who knew what
