problem is I don't even look there.","start":244.941,"stop":246.793,"duration":1.85},{"text":"I look to the TVPA, section 2 (a)(2) which uses the word person.","start":246.793,"stop":252.014,"duration":5.22},{"text":"So, it wasn't as if in writing the statute Congress forgot the word

that.","start":281.366,"stop":283.551,"duration":2.19},{"text":"The argument the other side has is the word--","start":283.551,"stop":286.337,"duration":2.79}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia

squarely held, only natural people acting as administrator or executor of an estate can bring an action.","start":308.866,"stop":321.008,"duration":12.14},{"text":"So the word person refers to natural

mean.","start":323.276,"stop":327.162,"duration":3.89},{"text":"Now you have a theory that they all just read Judge Edwards and they came in and used \"individual\" but it seems actually that we know where individual came from in this statute.","start":327.162,"stop":337.02,"duration":9.86},{"text":"The statute started out by saying person and then there was this moment where one Congressman said,

individual.","start":337.02,"stop":355.247,"duration":18.23},{"text":"So that's the way individual got into the statute.","start":355.247,"stop":358.366,"duration":3.12},{"text":"And it got in

statute.","start":361.568,"stop":365.37,"duration":3.8},{"text":"But the question, as this Court has always looked to legislative history is, what does that -- what light does that shed on Congress's understanding of the law to ultimately pass.","start":365.37,"stop":373.376,"duration":8.01},{"text":"So two Congresses later, four years later Congress passed the statute with the word individual.","start":373.376,"stop":378.013,"duration":4.64},{"text":"And the problem with that--","start":378.013,"stop":379.363,"duration":1.35}]},{"speakerName":"Elena

meaningful and so I do it.","start":397.408,"stop":400.96,"duration":3.55},{"text":"And so far -- so far, I think I have to say that you are on a weak wicket.","start":400.96,"stop":409.566,"duration":8.61},{"text":"The word persons when it was there, I found lots and lots of instances and by people in the civil international civil rights community who are testifying.","start":409.566,"stop":419.674,"duration":10.11},{"text":"Or I look at what they say and over and over they say, a limited statute -- the person won't often be in the United

time.","start":432.831,"stop":445.741,"duration":12.91},{"text":"In fact they thought it would be a nice thing but -- but -- I mean that's the tenor of what I seem to have found so

person.","start":483.714,"stop":489.001,"duration":5.29},{"text":"And one would expect that if people thought the word individual meant something different and limited the class of defendants, that
