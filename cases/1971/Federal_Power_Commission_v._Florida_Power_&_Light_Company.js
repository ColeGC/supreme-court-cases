court.","start":36.868,"stop":41.092,"duration":4.22},{"text":"The question in this case here on writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit is whether respondent owns and operates facilities for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.","start":41.092,"stop":55.333,"duration":14.24},{"text":"If respondent does, then it is a “public utility” subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction under Section 201 of the Federal Power Act.","start":55.333,"stop":67.381,"duration":12.05},{"text":"Under section 201, electric energy is deemed to be transmitted in interstate commerce if “transmitted from a state and consumed at any point outside thereof.”","start":67.381,"stop":81.726,"duration":14.35},{"text":"On the basis of an extensive record, the Commission concluded that electric energy was indeed transmitted from respondent’s facilities in Florida and consumed out of state.","start":81.726,"stop":94.848,"duration":13.12},{"text":"This conclusion was based independently, one on analysis of the independence of respondent and out of state utilities and two on studies introduced by the Commission staff showing that electric power flows could be traced from respondent’s facilities to an out-of-state utility.","start":94.848,"stop":116.729,"duration":21.88},{"text":"Before turning to the facts of this case, I would like to note just briefly the consequences of Commission jurisdiction.","start":116.729,"stop":125.606,"duration":8.88},{"text":"The only immediate consequence in this case, if the Commission’s order is upheld by this court, would be to require respondent to comply with the Commission's uniform system of account.","start":125.606,"stop":137.586,"duration":11.98},{"text":"The establishment of jurisdiction however would also subject respondent's future wholesale sales of electric energy to Commission jurisdiction and also would enable the Commission under certain circumstances to what a respondent could interconnect and sell electric energy to other utilities.","start":137.586,"stop":159.667,"duration":22.08},{"text":"The pertinent facts in this case are as follows: Respondent is a major electric utility, it is the largest utility in Florida and in 1965 ranked ninth in the nation in terms of revenues.","start":159.667,"stop":180.136,"duration":20.47},{"text":"Its facilities are located wholly within the state of Florida and serve over 900,000 customers -- six of them were wholesale customers.","start":180.136,"stop":190.057,"duration":9.92},{"text":"Although, none of its facilities extend to the state line, respondent is interconnected with the Florida Power Corporation and the Florida Power Corporation in turn is interconnected with the Georgia Power Company as well as other utilities across the state line.","start":190.057,"stop":208.333,"duration":18.28},{"text":"In addition to its interconnection with the Florida Power Corporation, respondent is interconnected with three other Florida utilities and these five Florida utilities make up the Florida Operating Committee.","start":208.333,"stop":222.398,"duration":14.06},{"text":"Through the Committee, these utilities coordinate the installation and maintenance of generating equipment.","start":222.398,"stop":229.738,"duration":7.34},{"text":"They share generating reserves and they exchange information on a daily basis to better coordinate their operations.","start":229.738,"stop":240.209,"duration":10.47},{"text":"By these activities therefore each member is able to provide its customers with more reliable service.","start":240.209,"stop":248.558,"duration":8.35},{"text":"As I mentioned before, the Florida Power Corporation has interconnections across the state line with the Georgia Power Company and these two companies exchange substantial amounts of electric energy from year to year.","start":248.558,"stop":267.627,"duration":19.07},{"text":"All of the utilities, that I have referred to thus far

States.","start":267.627,"stop":286.314,"duration":18.69},{"text":"The first ground of the Commission's finding of jurisdiction in this case was based on an analysis of respondents operation as a part of its vast interconnected system.","start":286.314,"stop":298.879,"duration":12.56},{"text":"As the Commission staff expert witness testified, all our 140 members of the Interconnected Systems Group

some utilities.","start":575.716,"stop":588.959,"duration":13.24},{"text":"Without reaching the question as to whether the Commissions has discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction in certain

class.","start":599.291,"stop":609.724,"duration":10.43},{"text":"Now this is done with respect to the Commission’s accounting requirements, the Commission has established five different classes of utilities based on their revenues with very specific requirements for the large utilities and very minimal requirements for the small utilities.","start":609.724,"stop":630.012,"duration":20.29},{"text":"So in the event that a relatively small utility is interconnected to the interstate grid and is subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction, the effect on that utility maybe very small, the effect of the federal jurisdiction.","start":630.012,"stop":648.768,"duration":18.76},{"text":"Well, because all systems operate in

units.","start":648.768,"stop":666.043,"duration":17.27},{"text":"And all electric clocks for instance attached to the interstate network whether it be in Saint Louis or Miami, will keep precisely the

of the other systems including respondent reacted automatically to make up the deficiency.","start":786.668,"stop":793.277,"duration":6.61},{"text":"Respondent’s contribution as shown by exhibits in the record was to increase each generation by eight megawatts.","start":793.277,"stop":802.791,"duration":9.51},{"text":"Other benefits that also accrue from interconnected operations are as follows: As a result of frequency bias, deviations in the frequency are kept to a minimum, clocks keep better time, precision industrial operations are benefited, speed ups and slow downs of generating equipment are minimized, and as a result the inadvertent exchange of energy between systems is also minimized.","start":802.791,"stop":831.692,"duration":28.9},{"text":"In short, the evidence before the Commission showed that respondent, the other Florida utilities and the other members of Interconnected Systems Group, all operates interdependently.","start":831.692,"stop":843.703,"duration":12.01},{"text":"All the components of their respective systems are bonded together

three-phase power with each phase being transmitted separately from generation all the way to the distribution point thus buses which I discussed before as the junction device for joining transmission
