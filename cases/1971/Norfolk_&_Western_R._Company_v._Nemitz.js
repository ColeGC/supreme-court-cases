Line.","start":324.694,"stop":341.068,"duration":16.37},{"text":"In this respect, the protection provided by Section 3 differed somewhat from that provided by Sections 1 and 2, under Sections 1 and 2 the employees were protected on the basis of their full pre-merger earnings, by protection for Pennsylvania employees was limited to their earnings from the Sandusky Line.","start":341.068,"stop":361.637,"duration":20.57},{"text":"The reason for this difference lies in the nature of the transaction.","start":361.637,"stop":366.374,"duration":4.74},{"text":"With respect to the Nickel Plate and Wabash employees who were covered by Sections 1 and 2, the Pennsylvania or the N and W rather required the entire working territory that these employees held seniority rights over.","start":366.374,"stop":380.809,"duration":14.44},{"text":"The protection which the N and W provided was accordingly based on their pre-merger employment without limitation.","start":380.809,"stop":389.528,"duration":8.72},{"text":"The Pennsylvania employees then on the other hand who worked on the Sandusky Line, also worked in other portions of the

Division.","start":409.652,"stop":413.22,"duration":3.57},{"text":"These employees worked part of the time on the Sandusky Line and part of the time another portions of the Toledo Division.","start":413.22,"stop":421.138,"duration":7.92},{"text":"When the N and W acquired the Sandusky Line it thus acquired only a portion of the working territory of these employees and it offered protection limited to the portion of the territory acquired.","start":421.138,"stop":434.43,"duration":13.29},{"text":"This type of protection was intended primarily to discourage an excessive transfer of Pennsylvania employees to the N and W pursuant to the option which I have already referred to.","start":434.43,"stop":447.088,"duration":12.66},{"text":"If a transfer appeared attractive only to those with full time earnings on the Sandusky Line, it was assumed that a sufficient number of employees would remain with the Pennsylvania to permit it, to man its operation on the remaining portions of the Toledo Division and that the number electing employment with the N and W would be fairly consistent with the operational need down the acquired line.","start":447.088,"stop":472.533,"duration":25.44},{"text":"Despite this purpose some employee with limited earnings on the Sandusky Line did elect to become N and W employees.","start":472.533,"stop":481.906,"duration":9.37},{"text":"The respondent in this situation, in this case rather, illustrate the situation.","start":481.906,"stop":488.044,"duration":6.14},{"text":"Prior to the merger, the respondents here worked primarily on other portions of the Toledo Division spending only very limited time on the Sandusky Line.","start":488.044,"stop":499.335,"duration":11.29},{"text":"They nevertheless chose to abandon their former working territory and to limit themselves to the Sandusky Line, which had provided only minimal work opportunities for them.","start":499.335,"stop":510.367,"duration":11.03},{"text":"Had these employees remained with the Pennsylvania, it is unlikely that the sale of the Sandusky Line would have any appreciable effect on their earnings.","start":510.367,"stop":520.948,"duration":10.58},{"text":"To return to the chronology events, the Commission approved the merger in 1964.","start":520.948,"stop":526.465,"duration":5.52},{"text":"Its report referred to the fact that the employee representatives in the N and W had entered into an agreement pertaining to employee protection and as to such employees the Commission found that in view of the agreement, no conditions be imposed for the protection of those employees covered by such agreements.","start":526.465,"stop":547.688,"duration":21.22},{"text":"Now, with respect to employees not covered by the agreement, the Commission did prescribe and imposed in its order of approval the traditional for your income protection with Section 5 2 f requires in those circumstances.","start":547.688,"stop":563.964,"duration":16.28},{"text":"The approved transactions were consummated in October 1964.","start":563.964,"stop":569.551,"duration":5.59},{"text":"During the month immediately following the N and W and the brotherhood attempted to compute protective benefit due to the Sandusky Line employees.","start":569.551,"stop":578.779,"duration":9.23},{"text":"The N and W was able to obtain from the Pennsylvania earnings data pertaining only to total earnings over the Toledo Division.","start":578.779,"stop":587.389,"duration":8.61},{"text":"It was unable to obtain in the initial stages following the merger, a break down showing wages earned on the Sandusky Line alone.","start":587.389,"stop":596.787,"duration":9.4},{"text":"It was consequently impossible on basis of that data to determine the benefits due to employees under Section 3.","start":596.787,"stop":603.981,"duration":7.19},{"text":"Accordingly, an implementing agreement and a letter of understanding were entered into.","start":603.981,"stop":609.618,"duration":5.64},{"text":"The letter of understanding provided for monetary payments which met the immediate needs of the employees, while the implementing agreement contained a very detailed formula with respect to the calculation of benefits.","start":609.618,"stop":624.347,"duration":14.73},{"text":"The agreement very expressly provided that such benefits were to be determined by taking the total compensation received by the affected employees for service performed on the Sandusky Line in 12 months prior to merger and dividing by 12.","start":624.347,"stop":643.219,"duration":18.87},{"text":"Following this disposition of the matter several of the employees, former Pennsylvania employees, complained to their union officials that implementing agreement 1A and the letter of understanding did not provide the payment that they were entitled to under the 1962 agreement.","start":643.219,"stop":662.503,"duration":19.28},{"text":"These employees contented that the 1962 agreement protected entire earnings over the entire Toledo Division that implementing agreement 1A gave them something less.","start":662.503,"stop":674.777,"duration":12.27},{"text":"The brotherhood officials, who had negotiated these agreement, advised the complaining employees that their interpretation of the 1962 agreement was wrong and that implementing agreement 1A as fully consistent with the 1962 agreement.","start":674.777,"stop":690.934,"duration":16.16},{"text":"The complaining employees were then afforded to full hearing before the brotherhood of National Board of Appeals where their position was fully presented and thoroughly considered.","start":690.934,"stop":701.691,"duration":10.76},{"text":"The employees also urged before the board that the question of the meaning of the 1962 agreement at relationship to the implementing agreement 1A should be taken to arbitration and as provided by the agreement.","start":701.691,"stop":714.98,"duration":13.29},{"text":"The Brotherhood's National Board of Appeals, is very highest appellate body concluded that the position taken by the employees was without merit and that implementing agreement 1A was entirely consistent with the 1962 agreement.","start":714.98,"stop":730.614,"duration":15.63},{"text":"The board also did conclude that there was no disagreement between brotherhood and the N and W as to the meaning of these agreements and it consequently inclined to invoke arbitration.","start":730.614,"stop":743.237,"duration":12.62},{"text":"Employees then instituted the present action under Section 9 of the Interstate Commerce Act under theory that the N and W had acted contrary to the 1962 agreement, that the Commission had incorporated the 1962 agreement in to its order, that the N and W had therefore violated an order of interstate Commerce Commission.","start":743.237,"stop":765.234,"duration":22},{"text":"The N and W moved for dismissal in summary judgment under ground, one, that the Court was without

Section 5 (2) (f), the Commission must prescribe protection for affected employees whether or not a prior agreement on this subject has been made.","start":809.397,"stop":823.348,"duration":13.95},{"text":"The court acknowledged the Commission had expressly disclaimed any intent or obligation to prescribe protective conditions but it held

(f).","start":823.348,"stop":844.697,"duration":21.35},{"text":"The court accordingly concluded that the right set forth in the 1962 agreement were incorporated in the 1964 order and for purposes of

wrong.","start":877.015,"stop":883.731,"duration":6.72},{"text":"The basic and primary error of the decisions below concerns the conclusion that the Interstate Commerce Commission as required by Section 5 (2) (f) of the Act to prescribe protection for employees despite the existence of a prior collective bargaining agreement on this subject.","start":883.731,"stop":902.819,"duration":19.09},{"text":"In terms of the act, its legislative history, it clearly show that congress intended to preserve for the parties to a merger, the right to resolve employee protection problems reflect to bargaining and that an agreement on the subject was to be a self sustaining alternative to the prescription of conditions by the Commission.","start":902.819,"stop":924.926,"duration":22.11},{"text":"This is apparent both in the terms of the Act and its legislative history.","start":924.926,"stop":929.431,"duration":4.5},{"text":"Respect to the letter structure of the Act, the first two sentences require the Commission as a part of its approval of a covered

other provision of the Act, representatives of the carrier and there employees may enter into agreements pertaining to protection of employee.","start":943.326,"stop":958.94,"duration":15.61},{"text":"The only possible reason for the inclusion of this not withstanding language was to ensure that nothing in the Act would be

protection.","start":958.94,"stop":979.844,"duration":20.9},{"text":"The only provisions of the Act which relates in any way to employee protection are the provisions Section 5 (2) (f).","start":979.844,"stop":987.343,"duration":7.5},{"text":"The first two sentences of that section are thus the only possible source of restrictions on the party's rights to agree to employee protection would seem indisputable therefore that the notwithstanding clause of Section 5 (2) (f) eliminates any restrictions on the collective bargaining process which might otherwise be inferred from the first two sentences relating to the Commission's authority and obligations in the premises.","start":987.343,"stop":1015.831,"duration":28.49},{"text":"This apparent literal meaning is amply confirmed by the legislative history of the Section.","start":1015.831,"stop":1021.746,"duration":5.91},{"text":"This history shows that Section 5 was the results of an agreement between labor and
