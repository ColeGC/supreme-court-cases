Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.","start":21.888,"stop":28.622,"duration":6.73},{"text":"It raises a question with which this court is familiar -- whether a shareholder in a closely held

corporation.","start":40.966,"stop":46.14,"duration":5.17},{"text":"The difference between a business and nonbusiness bad debt deduction is critical since the former is deductible against the ordinary income and maybe carried back as part of a net operating loss, whereas the latter is deductible only as a short term capital loss and may not be carried back to offset the ordinary income prior years.","start":46.14,"stop":71.401,"duration":25.26},{"text":"This court’s decision in Whipple against the Commissioner in 1963, settled the question whether merely investing in a corporation is a

remuneration constitutes a trade or business, an employee who advances funds to his corporation in order to protect his job and salary and who is unable to collect the debt owed to him by his corporation, is entitled to a business bad debt deduction.","start":98.141,"stop":122.609,"duration":24.47},{"text":"The problem in this case arises where a taxpayer bears the dual relationship of

nonbusiness.","start":148.8,"stop":169.662,"duration":20.86},{"text":"The loss must be characterized in its entirety as business or nonbusiness in nature even though the shareholder employee was

advanced to the corporation in 1962 in direct loans.","start":505.274,"stop":516.206,"duration":10.93},{"text":"In his income tax return for 1962, Mr. Generes treated the loss on the direct loans as a nonbusiness bad debt and the commissioner allowed that loss and it is not here in dispute.","start":516.206,"stop":529.427,"duration":13.22},{"text":"However, he treated his indemnification loss of
