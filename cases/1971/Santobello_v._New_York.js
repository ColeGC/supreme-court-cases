circumstantially and inferentially he clearly indicates and has always indicated that he is innocent and I think that too is an irrelevant aspect of this case because the petitioner has made no doubt

is a casuistic line of reasoning.","start":755.723,"stop":763.612,"duration":7.89},{"text":"Because there was no functional equivalency here, he said that after all, the respondent says after all

articulation of a statement.","start":823.218,"stop":831.295,"duration":8.08},{"text":"At page 38, the actual or the word arraign him for sentence

the fact that he adverts to organize crime, adverts the fact that this man had allegedly or not allegedly but had been previously convicted of a murder, which incidentally as I understand it from knowledge of the co-defendant in that same case, a fellow by the name of Joseph Corbo (ph), the United States Court of Appeals had declared that a confession in the Corbo case had been involuntarily obtained and it is my understanding that Santobello also reaped the benefit of that because although not for that he would still be in jail.","start":854.531,"stop":895.43,"duration":40.9},{"text":"He

guilt.","start":906.926,"stop":915.237,"duration":8.31},{"text":"And when the prosecutor says that he was sophisticated, he maybe correct to the extent the he knew what could happen to him because he

forward and say what is the basis for these allegations.","start":929.189,"stop":954.918,"duration":25.73},{"text":"They are just articulated at the time of sentence which was done here and to say that a Judge can sit by in completely without being affected by that, I say is a mental gymnastic which no judge in the world or very few judges could possibly

serious and important factor in this case.","start":976.948,"stop":983.071,"duration":6.12},{"text":"Now, in addition to the forgoing, the District Attorney in arguing further on his conception of functional equivalency states that we really should look into the issue of whether or not this man received a fair sentence.","start":983.071,"stop":1004.689,"duration":21.62},{"text":"And with all
