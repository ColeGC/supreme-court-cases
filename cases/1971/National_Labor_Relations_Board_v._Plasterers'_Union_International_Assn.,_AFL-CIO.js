unfair labor practice fashion that it does with other unfair labor practice charges hold that unfair 8 (b) (4) (D) charge in abeyance because 10 (k) states that the board is empowered and directed to hear and determine to dispute out of which such unfair labor practice shall have arisen unless parties to such dispute, submit to the board, satisfactory evidence that they have adjusted or agreed upon methods for the voluntary adjustment of the dispute.","start":85.086,"stop":148.024,"duration":62.94},{"text":"Now, a board sense 10 (k) was added to the Act in

assignment.”","start":154.534,"stop":167.662,"duration":13.13},{"text":"Hence, unless all three parties have agreed upon methods for the voluntary adjustment under the dispute, the board itself must

the dispute under Section 10 (k) and correctness of this interpretation is the issue that we have here.","start":197.27,"stop":207.011,"duration":9.74},{"text":"Now, the underlying facts are briefly these.","start":207.011,"stop":213.625,"duration":6.61},{"text":"A Plasters’ Union picketed two different jobs in furtherance of its demand that the work of applying a code of Portland cement mortar

Trades Department of the AFL-CIO and certain employer groups.","start":269.988,"stop":297.498,"duration":27.51},{"text":"Both Unions by virtue of their affiliation with Internationals who are members of the Building Trades Department are bound by decisions of the Joint Board.","start":297.498,"stop":312.384,"duration":14.89},{"text":"But neither Texas State; the sub-contractor, nor the Association, to which it belonged, had agreed to be bound by the decisions of the Joint Board.","start":312.384,"stop":324.239,"duration":11.85},{"text":"The Joint Board awarded the disputed work to the Plasters finding that the matter was governed by a 1917 agreement, between the two International Unions and a 1924 decision interpreting that agreement.","start":324.239,"stop":343.724,"duration":19.49},{"text":"Parenthetically, I might point out at this point that the whole dispute arose because of the development of a new bonding agents that were not discovered until 1950, but nonetheless the Joint Board awarded this work to the Plasters based on the 1917 agreement.","start":343.724,"stop":365.062,"duration":21.34},{"text":"When Texas State refused to change its work assignment in accordance with the Joint Board award, Plasters commenced picketing at the job site to force such a change.","start":365.062,"stop":375.995,"duration":10.93},{"text":"Southwestern the general contractor filed charges with the board alleging that the picketing violated Section 8 (b) (4) (D) for the Act.","start":375.995,"stop":385.776,"duration":9.78},{"text":"The second job involved the re-modeling of the Rainbow Bakery.","start":385.776,"stop":392.515,"duration":6.74},{"text":"There Martini, a

with the board.","start":411.82,"stop":423.407,"duration":11.59},{"text":"The Board's Regional Director finding a reasonable cause to believe that the charges had merit and finding that neither of the employers here at Texas State or Martini were bound by a voluntary method of adjustment proceeded to a 10 (k) hearing, at which all the competing Unions and the employers involved presented argument and evidence.","start":423.407,"stop":455.348,"duration":31.94},{"text":"It was a seven-day hearing in support of their respective

relevant skills and efficiency of operation, agreements between the two Unions and the Joint Board award on the basis of -- after considering all of these factors and the evidence adduced, the board concluded that employees represented by the Tile Setters rather than those represented by the Plasters were entitled for the work in dispute.","start":460.384,"stop":511.765,"duration":51.38},{"text":"In short, it came out differently than the Joint Board had, which had awarded the work to the Plasters.","start":511.765,"stop":518.977,"duration":7.21},{"text":"When the Plasters refused to comply with the board's determination of the work dispute, the Board’s General Counsel at that point issued the complaint upon the 8 (b) (4) (D) charge which had been held in abeyance in the expectation that the Section 10 (k) determination would have to settled the matter.","start":518.977,"stop":537.585,"duration":18.61},{"text":"It did not and under the scheme of the statutes you pick up the unfair labor practice into the case again, complaint issued, it went to the board, the board concluded that the picketing by the Plasters violated Section 8 (b) (4) (D) and it issued a cease and desist order, requiring the Plasters to cease this activity and to post appropriate notices.","start":537.585,"stop":564.671,"duration":27.09},{"text":"As indicated earlier, the Court below refused to enforce the boards order on the ground that the board had no power to re-determine the dispute.","start":564.671,"stop":575.379,"duration":10.71},{"text":"Now, as I indicated at the outset, the abstention clause in Section 10 (k) comes into play when the parties to such dispute, submit to the board, satisfactory evidence that they have adjusted or agreed upon methods were voluntary adjustment of the dispute.","start":575.379,"stop":596.707,"duration":21.33},{"text":"Now, Congress did not define who the parties to the dispute were and it did not indicate whether dispute means, the underlying jurisdictional dispute or it means the dispute and the jurisdictional does a strike which has emanated from the dispute.","start":596.707,"stop":616.017,"duration":19.31},{"text":"The Court below construed the term such dispute to mean merely the basic work controversy and it concluded that only the two Unions were parties to that dispute because in the words of the Court below, the employer in a jurisdictional dispute is a neutral caught in the crossfire between the disputing Unions, and unable to satisfy either.","start":616.017,"stop":646.329,"duration":30.31},{"text":"He cares not how the dispute is decided, but once merely that it be decided.","start":646.329,"stop":653.616,"duration":7.29},{"text":"Now, we submit that therein lies the fundamental error in the Court’s reasoning,
