makes two different arguments.","start":136.185,"stop":143.484,"duration":7.3},{"text":"One is that even when transportation is for the purpose of sale, Congress cannot prohibit the use of common carriers to transport obscene materials interstate.","start":143.484,"stop":154.08,"duration":10.6},{"text":"The second argument assumes that commercial transportation maybe forbidden, but contends that the statute is invalid as it applies to non-commercial transportation and that this impermissible overbreadth renders the entire section invalid on its face.","start":154.08,"stop":169.895,"duration":15.81},{"text":"It is the government's position that the statute is constitutional in both its commercial and non-commercial applications.","start":169.895,"stop":176.766,"duration":6.87},{"text":"If however, it is considered unconstitutional in some or all non-commercial applications, it is our position that the statute should not be declared invalid on its face, but limited to its permissible application.","start":176.766,"stop":192.002,"duration":15.24},{"text":"I turn first to the argument that even transportation for sale is constitutionally protected.","start":192.002,"stop":198.726,"duration":6.72},{"text":"In Reidel, as Court refused to recognize a constitutional right to distribute or sell obscene materials and reiterated the principle of Roth that obscenity and its distribution are outside the reach of the First Amendment.","start":198.726,"stop":212.595,"duration":13.87},{"text":"In Thirty-Seven Photographs, six justices squarely held that importation of obscenity for commercial distribution is not constitutionally protected.","start":212.595,"stop":222.01,"duration":9.41},{"text":"Appellee concedes that the First Amendment would not protect the commercial distributor of obscene materials who wishes to import such materials or send them through the mails, but he argues that the same commercial distributor who wishes to transport materials in interstate commerce is constitutionally protected.","start":222.01,"stop":240.741,"duration":18.73},{"text":"Congress' plenary power to prohibit not just materials from flowing in interstate commerce, has long been a cornerstone of this Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause.","start":240.741,"stop":250.654,"duration":9.91},{"text":"In Gibbons versus Ogden, the Court said that Congress' power over commerce among the states is vested, “as absolutely as it would be in a single government.”","start":250.654,"stop":261.301,"duration":10.65},{"text":"And in the lottery cases as well as many others, it has sustained absolute prohibitions against items of commerce judged harmful.","start":261.301,"stop":268.703,"duration":7.4},{"text":"In Hope versus United States which is cited in our briefs, where the Court sustained the White Slave Traffic Act, the Court assumed the constitutionality of these provisions and used those as a premise to reach the result in that case.","start":268.703,"stop":283.581,"duration":14.88},{"text":"Congress' powers over commerce are of course, limited by the First Amendment, but the First Amendment is also relevant to what Congress can preclude from the mails or forbid from being imported.","start":283.581,"stop":295.602,"duration":12.02},{"text":"Appellee cites a number of cases for the proposition that the government has special powers over mail because it operates the postal system.","start":295.602,"stop":303.254,"duration":7.65},{"text":"But in this First Amendment context at least, these cases have no authority after Blount versus Rizzi and Lamont versus Postmaster General.","start":303.254,"stop":312.671,"duration":9.42},{"text":"The government can no more exclude protected materials from the mail on the basis of their content, but it can exclude them from commerce.","start":312.671,"stop":320.171,"duration":7.5},{"text":"And conversely if commercial distribution of obscenity through the mails can be prohibited, so also can any sort of transportation in interstate commerce for commercial purposes.","start":320.171,"stop":333.825,"duration":13.65},{"text":"Assuming that Congress may validly prohibit the use of common carriers traveling interstate for the commercial distribution of obscene materials, the order of the District Court in this case should be reversed either if transportation for personal use may also be prohibited or if invalidity as to transportation for personal use does not require striking down the entire section.","start":333.825,"stop":357.439,"duration":23.61},{"text":"We believe the statute is constitutional in it's non-commercial as well it's the commercial applications.","start":357.439,"stop":364.471,"duration":7.03},{"text":"But I consider the overbreadth point first because we believe it's clearly controlled by Thirty-Seven Photographs.","start":364.471,"stop":371.234,"duration":6.76},{"text":"First, I would like to clear up what seems to be an issue from appellee's brief, but is not really an issue.","start":371.234,"stop":378.618,"duration":7.38},{"text":"We do contend that it is inappropriate to hold this section invalid on its face, but we do not contend that appellee lacks standing to make that claim.","start":378.618,"stop":388.945,"duration":10.33},{"text":"Appellee does have standing to make the claim that invalidity in some applications renders the section invalid for all applications, whether or not he is a commercial distributor.","start":388.945,"stop":400.282,"duration":11.34},{"text":"If on the other hand, as we contend, invalidity in some applications would not render the statute invalid as to all applications, then the District Court could determine in subsequent proceedings in this case, the purpose of the transportation here.","start":400.282,"stop":417.244,"duration":16.96},{"text":"In neither of that is this Court required to determine appellee's purpose from this record, so that really is not an issue at this point in the case.","start":417.244,"stop":427.826,"duration":10.58},{"text":"In Thirty-Seven Photographs, the same six Justices who held that importation for commercial purposes could be prohibited, also held that the District Court in that case was wrong to strike down the entire section in its application to commercial importation because importation for personal use might be constitutionally protected.","start":427.826,"stop":449.631,"duration":21.8},{"text":"Mr. Justice White's majority in plurality opinion said, “the proper approach was not to invalidate the section in its entirety, but to construe it narrowly and hold it valid in its application to Luros” and Justices Harlan and Stewart concurred on the same ground.","start":449.631,"stop":466.979,"duration":17.35},{"text":"As these opinions indicate, a holding of facial invalidity for overbreadth is not appropriate when a statute can be clearly narrowed to constitutional applications in a way that will eliminate virtually all of the possible chilling effect on protected communication.","start":466.979,"stop":483.004,"duration":16.03}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"In this case, Mr. Greenawalt all we
