to.","start":607.841,"stop":614.531,"duration":6.69},{"text":"In every Indian's sale, there was also a deviation from the regulatory provision which had been promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior.","start":614.531,"stop":624.041,"duration":9.51},{"text":"Specifically, the regulations require that any sale must be by endorsement of the certificate itself, never in the history of the Ute Termination Act, at least prior to August 27, 1964, was a sale negotiated in that fashion.","start":624.041,"stop":639.522,"duration":15.48},{"text":"The regulations also required that the

transaction.","start":660.333,"stop":664.475,"duration":4.14},{"text":"Also, the bank and its officers neglected and failed to disclose to any of these Indians that they were acting on its dual capacity as market maker in relation to the stock.","start":664.475,"stop":678.312,"duration":13.84},{"text":"Now, it is true that there are also a large number of other facts which affected any particular Indian stock and the petitioner certainly take the position that those dissimilar facts standing alone would be sufficient to give rise to a fraud claim.","start":678.312,"stop":696.868,"duration":18.56},{"text":"And the bank, in its briefs in this case, has attempted to focus on those dissimilar facts.","start":696.868,"stop":706.627,"duration":9.76},{"text":"The petitioners take the position that it is not necessary to get involve in the dispute over whether any particular Indian got a car, whether economic pressures were applied to any particular Indian in its sole and what fashion the economic pressures were applied for the simple reason that the common elements, which necessarily affected every transaction, are sufficient to give rise to the fraud claims and were so determined by the trial judge.","start":706.627,"stop":740.054,"duration":33.43},{"text":"The claim against the

petitioners that the United States negligently permitted a deviation from the regulations which have been promulgated, permitted a deviation from their requirement that the endorsement of the stock certificate be the only way in which this -- the stock could be transferred substituted in its step the -- the transfer of the stock by means of a separate stock power.","start":750.94,"stop":778.719,"duration":27.78},{"text":"That may seem unimportant on the surface that the effect of that deviation from the regulations was to withhold from the Indians the warnings which were -- which were printed on that stock for his benefit.","start":778.719,"stop":792.979,"duration":14.26},{"text":"The United States also, even though as we read the statute in regulations, Congress plainly directed that the superintendent was to regulate the price in terms of sale.","start":792.979,"stop":803.636,"duration":10.66},{"text":"Instead of doing so, the superintendent adopted a practice of -- of receiving a certificate from the Indian himself, the selling Indian who was legally in -- in the position of a war, that he had in fact received his -- his money.","start":803.636,"stop":819.728,"duration":16.09},{"text":"Thus, there was a complete application of the responsibilities of the United States in that regard and the person who was legally in the position of the award was the one who the United States looked to -- to satisfy those -- those regulatory obligations whereas Congress, I think a fair reading of the Act would -- would bear me out on this plainly contemplated that BIA should --","start":819.728,"stop":846.304,"duration":26.58}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"Isn't it true that the statute itself was --

Nielson","textObjs":[{"text":"That is true, Mr. Justice Marshall.","start":852.584,"stop":854.71,"duration":2.13},{"text":"That was the dominant purpose of the statute, but it's also true that Congress recognized in adopting the statute as it did in all of the termination acts that these people were going to have some trouble.","start":854.71,"stop":868.31,"duration":13.6},{"text":"They were not accustomed to managing property because they had been under the protective wing of the United States for so many years, and so Congress wisely, I think, directed that there'd be a face period three in which services and protections would be withdrawn from that, and that that period was to extend for a full 10 years.","start":868.31,"stop":889.826,"duration":21.52},{"text":"Now, experience was proven that even that wasn't enough, that -- that these people needed protections even beyond what Congress contemplated, but the thing we are here complaining about is -- is that the protections which Congress directed were not secured to these people and that by reason of that, they were deprived of their property.","start":889.826,"stop":915.04,"duration":25.21},{"text":"Now, in many ways, the complaint of these petitioners seems based upon fine distinctions in the law.","start":915.04,"stop":926.337,"duration":11.3},{"text":"We presented enough a lot of complex legal arguments in the briefs.","start":926.337,"stop":932.127,"duration":5.79},{"text":"In reality, however, we're talking about a very fundamental proposition, a very practical and fundamental proposition.","start":932.127,"stop":939.922,"duration":7.8},{"text":"We could analogize, I think, to a situation where it say, a person were to buy an annuity and pay for it throughout his life, and

mismanaged.","start":975.335,"stop":983.336,"duration":8},{"text":"The problem really is the indignity of the Act itself to take a group of people such as these terminated Utes and say to them by way of congressional enactment that we're going to remove restrictions on -- on your person and on your property, and you're going to be treated like any other citizens in this country and yet before that property ever gets into that Indian's hands to take it and assign it, to have BIA assign it to this corporation, and not only to assignment but to make the assignment or purport to make the assignment irrevocable so that it would bind himself and his heirs forever.","start":983.336,"stop":1022.491,"duration":39.15},{"text":"Now, Congress plainly declared in the statute that they were to receive
