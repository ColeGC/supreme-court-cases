needy.","start":650.729,"stop":656.097,"duration":5.37},{"text":"The states have ample opportunity to protect themselves from adverse fiscal impact under this Courtâ€™s decision in Rosado, allowing

minimal.","start":677.61,"stop":685.367,"duration":7.76},{"text":"It would be approximately $500,000.00 a year and the Federal Government would point, put up the $500,000.00 a year making a total of approximately $1 million.","start":685.367,"stop":697.463,"duration":12.1},{"text":"We would also like to point out to the Court that the stateâ€™s purpose of encouraging employability which the state

employability.","start":697.463,"stop":715.132,"duration":17.67},{"text":"But we will submit that rationale under this Courtâ€™s decision in Shapiro is not permissible or not

need.","start":2822.07,"stop":2845.02,"duration":22.95},{"text":"But the fact remains that if we assume that Illinois has $100 and it chooses to give it to the 8-year-old, I do not think it could be said to be arbitrary that it chose to give that $100.00 to the 8-year-old as opposed to 20-year-old.","start":2845.02,"stop":2858.058,"duration":13.04},{"text":"The point being that even among those

in technical or vocational school, although, they are technically as needy as somebody who is in a college or university, those children are still less in need of number one because it is more likely

university.","start":2867.033,"stop":2895.89,"duration":28.86},{"text":"He can only get into a technical school.","start":2895.89,"stop":2898.641,"duration":2.75},{"text":"Secondly, he is not in as

Report went on to say federal sharing for this purpose would thus be available to states who implement such a program, for payments to children regularly attending a college or university as well as
