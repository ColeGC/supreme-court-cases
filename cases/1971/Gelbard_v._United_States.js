surveillance.","start":242.193,"stop":265.303,"duration":23.11},{"text":"Thus, the petitioners would be victims of such a federal crime before the grand jury and indeed looking at 2510 through 2520 of

used.","start":265.303,"stop":288.763,"duration":23.46},{"text":"With then, there is harm here to the petitioners, what is the remedy?","start":288.763,"stop":295.23,"duration":6.47},{"text":"The Government, if the Court please, concedes at page 23 of its brief in the Egan case which it adopts as its brief in our case.","start":295.23,"stop":305.425,"duration":10.19},{"text":"That if there was a pre-subpoena, adjudication that these taps were illegal, the Court, in adjudicating them illegal, under what it aptly terms, the Constitutional Rule of Silverthorne would and could prohibit the Government from using this illegally obtained material against these petitioners in this very grand jury proceeding, that is petitioners could hire a lawyer, file a civil suit under the authority of Go-Bart Importing Company, or Rio against United States or the Bivens case decided in this Court, short time ago and invoked a consistent course of Federal decision going back 60 years to Wise versus Henkel, in 220 U.S.","start":305.425,"stop":350.711,"duration":45.29},{"text":"They would claim that the inherent power of the Federal Court could be used reaching out the Federal Equity Power to enjoin the Government for making use of this material.","start":350.711,"stop":363.853,"duration":13.14},{"text":"Of course, as this Court has heard this morning, an argument in Tatum case, the Government might claim in such a civil suit that the case was not right for an injunction to issue, that is if the petitioners could not, before they have received the subpoena, demonstrate the kind of immediate harm that the Federal Equity Power has customarily used to protect against.","start":363.853,"stop":390.834,"duration":26.98},{"text":"But petitioner’s case, if the Court please, could not be more right, and that is why it is incredible to us that the Government won’t go the last six inches with us, since they have agreed on just about everything else and say that when the petitioners are standing in the jail house door that surely they have a right to prevent the use against them of this material.","start":390.834,"stop":415.404,"duration":24.57},{"text":"They are not, the petitioners are not, like the defendant in the case of Blue against United States.","start":415.404,"stop":423.412,"duration":8.01},{"text":"In the position of a gratuitous intervener in the grand jury, who merely suspects that here she is being talked about in the secrecy of the grand jury room and wants to stop the grand jury’s process.","start":423.412,"stop":435.939,"duration":12.53},{"text":"No, they are standing in the jailhouse door because the material the Government admits is going to be used against them in the grand jury room.","start":435.939,"stop":446.495,"duration":10.56},{"text":"So this case is no different, from asking a District Court to sustain any other claim of privilege, any other claim of privacy protecting privilege if the Court please, at the behest of any other grand jury witness, in any other grand jury, in any Federal Court in the land.","start":446.495,"stop":470.685,"duration":24.19},{"text":"In this connection, we ask the Court to note, as I mentioned before to the petitioners are after all, if this tap is illegal, being made the victim of a federal crime and they’re in the grand jury room.","start":470.685,"stop":481.726,"duration":11.04},{"text":"And so the Government asks this Court to break the promise which this Court made, in the Alderman case in two ways.","start":481.726,"stop":491.407,"duration":9.68},{"text":"First, by negating what Alderman termed the constitutional rule that forbids using the fruits of unlawful tapping against persons who, like the petitioners are agreed and second, they want to undermine Alderman by urging this Court to permit the Government to commit the federal crime detailed in Section 2511 and in this Court’s words, to let those who flop the rules go unscathed and to cavalierly disregard the rights of the person done with the act.","start":491.407,"stop":521.229,"duration":29.82},{"text":"So this Court can decide this case based on elementary principles of equity jurisprudence with some attention to the mandate of the Fourth Amendment in protecting the right of privacy, and some attention to the inherent power in the words of Wise versus Henkel of the District Court to protect against abuse of its process by its officers.","start":521.229,"stop":544.076,"duration":22.85},{"text":"The constitution surely requires no less, but there is, as two Courts of Appeals, one of them en bank have held a statutory ground of decision, which is available to the Court in this case.","start":544.076,"stop":557.686,"duration":13.61},{"text":"A 1968 Act, Sections 2510 through 2520 of Title 18 provide for notice, for

them.","start":571.201,"stop":577.755,"duration":6.55},{"text":"Section 2515 of the Act forbids the use of material unlawfully obtained in any Court or grand jury proceeding.","start":577.755,"stop":587.987,"duration":10.23},{"text":"Section 2518 of the act in Subdivision 9, requires that before material obtained under the Act is to be used against a person, there must be ten days notice given to that person.","start":587.987,"stop":603.88,"duration":15.89},{"text":"Other way this is one answer to the Government’s contention that our position here is going to sabotage grand juries.","start":603.88,"stop":610.51,"duration":6.63},{"text":"The Government knew it was going to use the fruits of this tapping against Mr. Gelbard and Mr. Parnas.","start":610.51,"stop":616.471,"duration":5.96},{"text":"If they had sent ten days before that grand jury appearance a letter saying we intend to use it, Mr. Gelbard and Parnas could have come
