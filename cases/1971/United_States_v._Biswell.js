firearms.","start":101.006,"stop":105.929,"duration":4.92},{"text":"Biswell was a licensed dealer of firearms.","start":105.929,"stop":108.983,"duration":3.05},{"text":"Under Section 923 of Title 18, dealers and firearms must be licensed and dealers who are explicitly defined to include pawnbrokers.","start":108.983,"stop":119.074,"duration":10.09},{"text":"Special Investigator Hupp of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division made a routine compliance visit to Biswell’s pawnshop.","start":119.074,"stop":128.89,"duration":9.82},{"text":"According to Hupp, such visits of dealers are made about once a year.","start":128.89,"stop":133.563,"duration":4.67},{"text":"Hupp identified himself and first inquired about Biswell’s records.","start":133.563,"stop":138.089,"duration":4.53},{"text":"He ascertained that Biswell was not keeping records in the form required of all firearms dealers.","start":138.089,"stop":143.819,"duration":5.73},{"text":"Hupp then indicated that he wish to see the storerooms where the firearms were kept.","start":143.819,"stop":148.697,"duration":4.88},{"text":"Biswell kept these along with other pawned items in a locked storage room.","start":148.697,"stop":153.822,"duration":5.13},{"text":"Biswell inquired if Hupp got a search warrant and Hupp said no but he showed Biswell a copy of the statute authorizing treasury agents to search the business premises of firearms dealers without warrants.","start":153.822,"stop":166.233,"duration":12.41},{"text":"At that point, Biswell said, well, that’s what it says so I guess it is okay and he unlocked the storeroom.","start":166.233,"stop":175.225,"duration":8.99},{"text":"Inside the storeroom, Hupp saw a rifle with an 11 and 3 quarter inch barrel.","start":175.225,"stop":181.447,"duration":6.22},{"text":"Any rifle with a barrel of less than 16 inches is an illegal firearm under the National Firearms Act of 1968.","start":181.447,"stop":190.321,"duration":8.87},{"text":"That Act does not absolutely forbid possession of such firearms but sharply constricts a rightful possession and commerce in such firearms.","start":190.321,"stop":200.059,"duration":9.74},{"text":"Each set of firearm must have serial number, each dealer in such firearms must pay a special occupational tax and be specially registered with the Secretary of the Treasury and whenever any such firearm is transferred, the transferor must pay a $200.00 transfer tax and obtain approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.","start":200.059,"stop":222.306,"duration":22.25},{"text":"It was clear to Agent Hupp that Biswell did not legally possess the sort of rifle he saw.","start":222.306,"stop":227.99,"duration":5.68},{"text":"There was no required serial number on the rifle.","start":227.99,"stop":230.817,"duration":2.83},{"text":"Biswell indicated that he had no idea such weapons had to be specially registered.","start":230.817,"stop":235.438,"duration":4.62},{"text":"Finally, it was obvious that no owner would pay transfer tax of $200.00 to get a $3.00 loan although of course Hupp didn’t know the amount of the loan but he knew it was much less than $200.00 from a pawnbroker.","start":235.438,"stop":247.375,"duration":11.94},{"text":"Soon after seeing this rifle, Hupp noticed another with a short barrel and he seize both rifles.","start":247.375,"stop":254.676,"duration":7.3},{"text":"The District Judge denied a motion to suppress the two sort of rifles and they were introduced at Biswell’s trial.","start":254.676,"stop":261.129,"duration":6.45},{"text":"They in the observations of them by Agent Hupp irrelevant to the count for which Biswell was convicted, engaging as a dealer on illegal firearms without having paid this special occupational tax.","start":261.129,"stop":273.372,"duration":12.24},{"text":"Among other claims on appeal, Biswell asserted that the search leading to the seizure of the rifles was unconstitutional.","start":273.372,"stop":280.5,"duration":7.13},{"text":"The Court of Appeals agreed that the search was unconstitutional and that the evidence should’ve been suppressed and it reversed the conviction.","start":280.5,"stop":288.687,"duration":8.19},{"text":"I think it may be useful that the outset to put aside what is not involved in this case.","start":288.687,"stop":294.392,"duration":5.7},{"text":"There is no assertion by Biswell that Hupp performed other than routine actions under the statute.","start":294.392,"stop":300.268,"duration":5.88},{"text":"It is not disputed that he was engaged in the periodic compliance visit.","start":300.268,"stop":304.891,"duration":4.62},{"text":"It is not disputed that such visits typically involved inspection of the firearms on the premises and if the entry into the storeroom was valid, the appropriateness of the seizure of the two clearly contraband weapons is not challenged.","start":304.891,"stop":320.98,"duration":16.09},{"text":"At the same time it is clear that Biswell unlocked the door of the storeroom because he acquiesced in an apparent show of the lawful authority.","start":320.98,"stop":329.98,"duration":9},{"text":"In an ordinary criminal investigation, his action would not of constituted consent to an otherwise unauthorize search.","start":329.98,"stop":339.103,"duration":9.12},{"text":"Thus, we do not argue that this search was consented to in the ordinary sense of consent.","start":339.103,"stop":348.461,"duration":9.36},{"text":"The case thus presents very clearly, the power of Congress to authorize treasury agents responsible for enforcement of the firearms laws to authorize those agents to inspect the business premises of firearms dealers without warrants.","start":348.461,"stop":365.103,"duration":16.64},{"text":"Both the Criminal Code and the Internal Revenue Code contain a multiplicity of regulations governing the sale and distribution of firearms.","start":365.103,"stop":373.111,"duration":8.01},{"text":"I take it there can be no question of the importance of close regulation of the gun industry.","start":373.111,"stop":378.738,"duration":5.63},{"text":"Approximately 60% of the murders in the country by use of firearms as are 95% of the killings of police officers on duty.","start":378.738,"stop":388.467,"duration":9.73},{"text":"The power of Congress to require licenses in registration and to tax this incidence of the gun industry has been consistently upheld.","start":388.467,"stop":399.037,"duration":10.57},{"text":"That power is not questioned in this case.","start":399.037,"stop":402.73,"duration":3.69},{"text":"As a central aspect of the regulatory scheme, Section 923 (g) of Title 18 provides for inspection.","start":402.73,"stop":412.653,"duration":9.92},{"text":"The relevant language for this case is “The Secretary may enter during business hours the premises including places of storage of any firearms or ammunition dealer for the purpose of inspecting any firearms or ammunition kept or stored by such dealer at such premises.”","start":412.653,"stop":435.896,"duration":23.24},{"text":"The clear import of this section is the treasury agents need not have a warrant to inspect and that licensed dealers have a duty under the statute to permit inspection.","start":435.896,"stop":448.888,"duration":12.99},{"text":"This Section is virtually identical with the Section considered by this Court in Colonnade Catering Corporation versus United States.","start":448.888,"stop":459.707,"duration":10.82},{"text":"In Colonnade, this Court held with three dissents that Congress had not authorized entry by physical force without a warrant.","start":459.707,"stop":468.588,"duration":8.88},{"text":"The significance of that case for this one however, is in the Court’s reasoning.","start":468.588,"stop":473.907,"duration":5.32},{"text":"The Court acknowledged that treasury agents have been given broad authority to enter and inspect the premises of liquor dealers and it determined that this authority is constitutional.","start":473.907,"stop":485.644,"duration":11.74},{"text":"Both the majority and the dissenters agree that the rule of Camara versus Municipal Court and See versus City of Seattle was inapplicable to that case.","start":485.644,"stop":495.496,"duration":9.85},{"text":"That rule of course is the one that requires a warrant for administrative
