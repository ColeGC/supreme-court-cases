decisions.","start":798.533,"stop":821.83,"duration":23.3},{"text":"Congress did and passed this Act which is negative in nature, not

supported by substantial evidence, and that no contract shall have a provision making a decision of an official, final, and plastered into the wall.","start":828.694,"stop":858.573,"duration":29.88},{"text":"The interpretation of this presents a very perfecting Clause so acknowledged by anyone who has had to deal with
