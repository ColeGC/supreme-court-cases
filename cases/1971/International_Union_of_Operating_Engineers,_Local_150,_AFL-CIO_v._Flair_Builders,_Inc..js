agreement still had 13 months to run, and pursuant to the Court directive made a demand on the company for arbitration of the contract issue and in addition made a demand for the other issues -- the arbitration of the other issues which has been set forth in the complaint.","start":272.987,"stop":295.481,"duration":22.49},{"text":"The Court, the counsel for the company then filed a motion to

this Courts decision in Wiley.","start":302.011,"stop":314.252,"duration":12.24},{"text":"Thereafter, the Court ordered a hearing on the merits of the case limited to the issue of whether or not there was contract, the threshold question.","start":314.252,"stop":326.725,"duration":12.47},{"text":"As a matter of fact during the course of the hearing, the District Court again stated its position of the issue of laches was for the arbitrator and not for the Court and further stated that it found that a binding collective bargaining agreement was an existence.","start":326.725,"stop":345.14,"duration":18.41},{"text":"However, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Court rendered a memorandum of opinion.","start":345.14,"stop":352.389,"duration":7.25},{"text":"In which it now found, yes, there was a binding contract but that the Union was guilty of laches in terms of it is bringing the action and accordingly it was unenforceable.","start":352.389,"stop":368.901,"duration":16.51},{"text":"Now at the hearing, we in fact never had a specific hearing on the question of laches because of the Courts position but that was not an issue for it to determine, and in fact when the employer raised the issue at the hearing, the Court attempted to limit our cross examination of the employer in the case who was obviously the company's chief witness to five minutes because he had already engaged in the long colloquy with counsel for the company.","start":368.901,"stop":400.605,"duration":31.7},{"text":"Pointing out that the only thing he was interested in was determining the binding nature of the contract.","start":400.605,"stop":409.079,"duration":8.47},{"text":"So that I do not feel that other than the question of the contract itself, there were any other significant facts.","start":409.079,"stop":420.393,"duration":11.31},{"text":"There was some evidence that there from the Union's point of view that there had been contacts.","start":420.393,"stop":425.55,"duration":5.16},{"text":"The employer denied any contacts during the term of the contract and the Court in changing its position from the position which had held during the hearing from the position that it held in its memorandum, not permitting counsels motion to dismiss on the Wiley case that he was crediting the company's testimony regarding laches even though frankly we have had no hearing on laches.","start":425.55,"stop":451.722,"duration":26.17},{"text":"Now, I think in terms of the argument in this case there are three essential considerations which the Court must make.","start":451.722,"stop":461.612,"duration":9.89},{"text":"Our position is first that the defensive laches clearly falls within the rational of this Court's decision in Wiley is particularly illustrated by what happened before the District Court.","start":461.612,"stop":476.605,"duration":14.99},{"text":"The District Court initially said the threshold issue of the contract existence was for the arbitrator.","start":476.605,"stop":483.923,"duration":7.32},{"text":"We then follow the Courts admonition and demanded arbitration.","start":483.923,"stop":488.481,"duration":4.56},{"text":"And in fact, as the Court indicates in its subsequent memo on the motion to dismiss.","start":488.481,"stop":493.353,"duration":4.87},{"text":"We pointed out to the Court that this Court had pointed, had stated that the threshold issue was in fact for the Court and not the arbitrator.","start":493.353,"stop":500.705,"duration":7.35},{"text":"And subsequently did determine that threshold issue as a binding contract.","start":500.705,"stop":507.974,"duration":7.27},{"text":"The Court then said laches wasn't for the Court but for the arbitrator and then change its position.","start":507.974,"stop":514.256,"duration":6.28},{"text":"Now, what happened?","start":514.256,"stop":515.884,"duration":1.63},{"text":"Laches is an equitable defense obviously with common law.","start":515.884,"stop":519.825,"duration":3.94},{"text":"It has two elements.","start":519.825,"stop":521.649,"duration":1.82},{"text":"Normally, it has a question of delay and also a question of prejudice.","start":521.649,"stop":527.714,"duration":6.07},{"text":"There was no testimony taken on the issue of prejudice and there was very little testimony other than the question of delay here.","start":527.714,"stop":537.073,"duration":9.36},{"text":"Now, frankly had the Court said to us, I am going to determine the issue of laches in this case.","start":537.073,"stop":543.593,"duration":6.52},{"text":"What we would have done is to have presented our case on the merits because here we had an employer with a continuing violation of the contract that it disregarded it since the first employee had become a member of the Union.","start":543.593,"stop":559.004,"duration":15.41},{"text":"We had a situation where the employer had refused to pay the wages and working conditions, and it simply ignored the contract.","start":559.004,"stop":566.575,"duration":7.57},{"text":"So obviously we would have had to present our entire case in the merits.","start":566.575,"stop":571.009,"duration":4.43},{"text":"We would have subpoenaed the company's books and records to determine what employees were involved because obviously this would relate to a defense in this kind of the case.","start":571.009,"stop":581.999,"duration":10.99},{"text":"In other words it would have been -- this hearing in fact took less than two hours.","start":581.999,"stop":587.252,"duration":5.25},{"text":"Had we -- had the Court said we are going to have a hearing on the issue of laches it would have taken two or three days.","start":587.252,"stop":592.359,"duration":5.11}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Baum, as I read your petition, the only question you present is the issue of whether the

Baum","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that's true, and I think it would -- the law obviously in the question of common law of the law of equity.","start":681.809,"stop":690.561,"duration":8.75},{"text":"The quest -- the defense of laches always relates to the facts of the particular case.","start":690.561,"stop":697.052,"duration":6.49},{"text":"Now, in this case not only do you have to worry about the facts of the particular case but you have a bargaining relationship to be concerned with, you have a continuing problem of violation, of a bargaining relationship because as I pointed out to the Court before when a demand for arbitration was made, we still had 13 months to run on the contract.","start":697.052,"stop":717.068,"duration":20.02},{"text":"So that there -- that even if there might be some question of delay which might affect the ultimate decision of the arbitrator.","start":717.068,"stop":724.99,"duration":7.92},{"text":"There is certainly could be no question of delay as it related to the final 13 months of the collective bargaining agreement.","start":724.99,"stop":733.226,"duration":8.24},{"text":"Now, I think the second consideration in this case would be the effect on the federal courts if we were to get into a situation where courts are going to start determining questions of delay.","start":733.226,"stop":749.893,"duration":16.67},{"text":"Every time a party to a collective bargaining agreement wanted to disrupt that relationship the simplest thing they could do, would be to start raising these defenses.","start":749.893,"stop":761.913,"duration":12.02},{"text":"Obviously, the purpose of arbitration at least in labor management, I would assume in commercial manners, is that there is a forum which can expedite the hearing and that the parties have this kind of relationship.","start":761.913,"stop":774.94,"duration":13.03},{"text":"It's a manner which they choose.","start":774.94,"stop":777.921,"duration":2.98},{"text":"And if we get -- if we start raising defenses whether it be waiver or estoppel, or we call it procedural delay, or we call it laches, still delay anyway.","start":777.921,"stop":789.505,"duration":11.58},{"text":"We are going to start delaying the process of arbitration.","start":789.505,"stop":793.645,"duration":4.14},{"text":"And any party that wants to delay the process of arbitration can do it simply by raising these types of defenses.","start":793.645,"stop":800.651,"duration":7.01},{"text":"And I think this Court in its decision starting with textile workers going through the Steelworkers trilogy, going through the recent decision in Boys Market and going through all of these cases is the theory that where the parties have agreed and they are going to arbitrate the case, we don't want that kind of issue on the Federal Court, it should be determined by an arbitrator.","start":800.651,"stop":825.491,"duration":24.84},{"text":"And that is exactly what we are talking about in this particular case.","start":825.491,"stop":832.015,"duration":6.52},{"text":"Now, the third element, I think that the Court must seriously look at is the question of the quid pro quo.","start":832.015,"stop":839.875,"duration":7.86},{"text":"I noted in reading this Court's decision in the Boys Market case, that one of the points which the Court made why is it the reason that they thought that in injunction should issue and Sinclair should be overruled was the fact that the employer would have to have an effective system of making arbitration work and the damages were not always the answer and that pointed out that with where there is an agreement to arbitrate and then you permit a strike, you are derogating the need for the employer to enter into the agreement which provides for arbitration because you are saying that the arbitration procedure is meaningless.","start":839.875,"stop":886.891,"duration":47.02},{"text":"Now, let's turn that around and let's put the foot on the other shoe from the Union's point of view.","start":886.891,"stop":893.315,"duration":6.42},{"text":"The union basically has the right to strike.","start":893.315,"stop":896.25,"duration":2.93},{"text":"That is its economic weapon that is the weapon that utilizes.","start":896.25,"stop":900.765,"duration":4.51},{"text":"Now, when you take that weapon and you say to the union give that weapon up during the term of the contract, we want industrial peace.","start":900.765,"stop":909.884,"duration":9.12},{"text":"But we will substitute for that the process of arbitration.","start":909.884,"stop":916.456,"duration":6.57},{"text":"And then you make that process, one that is ineffective, just in the case of Boys Market on the employer side where you turn it around to the Union side it makes it ineffective.","start":916.456,"stop":932.066,"duration":15.61},{"text":"Obviously, I think the quid pro quo for no strike is arbitration.","start":932.066,"stop":939.037,"duration":6.97},{"text":"It is not litigation in the Federal Court.","start":939.037,"stop":943.311,"duration":4.27},{"text":"Now, in addition, if I might return the Court for a moment to the issues raised the considerations in Wiley.","start":943.311,"stop":953.282,"duration":9.97},{"text":"This Court pointed out in Wiley that in addition to the problem of separating the marriage from the procedural issue.","start":953.282,"stop":962.157,"duration":8.88},{"text":"We had a question of delay.","start":962.157,"stop":964.071,"duration":1.91},{"text":"This case is over three years old.","start":964.071,"stop":966.603,"duration":2.53},{"text":"It is not yet come before the arbitrator.","start":966.603,"stop":970.299,"duration":3.7},{"text":"This Court raise the question in Wiley of the cost as I point out in the brief and I think this case so appropriately supports this Court's rational in Wiley.","start":970.299,"stop":984.134,"duration":13.84},{"text":"Counsel for the company, advised this Court after he had to grant the certiorari buy the company didn't have money to prepare a brief in this case.","start":984.134,"stop":998.304,"duration":14.17},{"text":"And we pointed out that could have happened just as well to the Union and the company because here the company says, they don't have enough money to take this case to the Highest Court.","start":998.304,"stop":1009.411,"duration":11.11},{"text":"We do not raise the defensive laches either but the cost factor can work either way.","start":1009.411,"stop":1015.508,"duration":6.1},{"text":"And as the Court pointed out in Wiley, this is correct.","start":1015.508,"stop":1018.899,"duration":3.39},{"text":"This is exactly what happened in this case.","start":1018.899,"stop":1022.448,"duration":3.55},{"text":"Now, in addition the Court in Wiley also talked about the question of duplication of effort, had the District Court followed through with this original decision that laches was for the arbitrator and not for the Court then counsel for the company could have easily raised the issue of delay before the arbitrator, irrespective of what we call it, whether we call it laches, whether we call it estoppel, whether we call it waiver.","start":1022.448,"stop":1055.627,"duration":33.18},{"text":"Obviously, I think that the --that this particular case falls clearly within the four corners of this Courts decision in Wiley.","start":1055.627,"stop":1076.34,"duration":20.71},{"text":"Arbitration frankly is a process which if it does not work or does not operate, really serves no purpose, now, getting back for a moment to the question of the no strike provision in this contract.","start":1076.34,"stop":1096.151,"duration":19.81},{"text":"It is interesting to note that under the terms of this particular contract the Union had a right to strike if the employer did not pay the wages and did not pay fringe benefits.","start":1096.151,"stop":1113.082,"duration":16.93},{"text":"We could have proceeded under arbitration or we could have struck.","start":1113.082,"stop":1116.844,"duration":3.76},{"text":"Yet, we chose not to strike the employer in this particular case and we chose to go the root of arbitration and not create any kind of an industrial tie up so that I think the facts of this particular contract.","start":1116.844,"stop":1134.098,"duration":17.25},{"text":"The facts of these particular case show that not only did we have a broad arbitration clause but as to some of the issues raised in arbitration, we could have used the right to strike, we have an option but rather we chose arbitration because we did not want to in any way affect the relationship.","start":1134.098,"stop":1154.683,"duration":20.59},{"text":"So that creates even in an additional policy reason why in
