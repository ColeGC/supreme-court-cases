being made that the Fifth Amendment protects only use of compelled testimony, and I want to address myself to that just for a moment and point out that the Fifth Amendment has been held by this Court in Ullmann not to be interpreted in a hostile or negative spirit, and that it is to be construed liberally to effectuate its intent and purposes and that was the holding of course in Spivak versus Kline (ph) as well as many other cases.","start":596.55,"stop":630.182,"duration":33.63},{"text":"And so I would note that there is not just one purpose as this Court observed in Murphy at page 55 and as observed as long ago as Boyd versus United States, the Fifth Amendment has many purposes that had to be considered when you are evaluating the question of whether use immunity is efficient.","start":630.182,"stop":651.511,"duration":21.33},{"text":"For one thing, the Fifth Amendment was designed and came in to our constitution to prevent disclosures by torture and well, I submit that maybe some may feel that that is kind of remote now, we are in a modern age.","start":651.511,"stop":669.074,"duration":17.56},{"text":"I would remind this Court that it was only 30 years ago when this Court was forced to deal with the problems of third degree in Brown versus Mississippi, Chambers versus Florida and a whole series of cases and only a few years ago when this Court had a hold Miranda that it was necessary for an accused to be given a warning about the effect of this testimony.","start":669.074,"stop":695.453,"duration":26.38},{"text":"So we are concerned with the scope of that protection as applied to coercion.","start":695.453,"stop":702.044,"duration":6.59},{"text":"But in addition to that, the Court please I would submit that the Fifth Amendment also has policy consideration which is long been the concern of this Court, that is the distrust that we have of coerced testimony, the distrust we have of it.","start":702.044,"stop":718.261,"duration":16.22},{"text":"I would submit that in Brown versus United States which was decided only a year after Walker versus Brown, this Court made a very important observation.","start":718.261,"stop":729.589,"duration":11.33},{"text":"It recognized at page 547 168 U.S., the human mind under the pressure of calamity is easily seduced and is liable and the alarm of danger to acknowledge indiscriminately, a falsehood or a truth as different agitations may prevail.","start":729.589,"stop":751.604,"duration":22.01},{"text":"And why I think that particular quotation is apt here is because the petitioners here are put in the position of avoiding jail not simply because they have been granted immunity or be held in contempt, but that they are compelled to avoid jail by giving information which they think the government may want to hear and ought to avoid prosecution.","start":751.604,"stop":785.424,"duration":33.82},{"text":"Now, that is a tendency, I would respectfully submit, that is inherent in any use immunity statute and certainly in the one involved.","start":785.424,"stop":794.403,"duration":8.98},{"text":"But there is another policy consideration here too and the Court please, and that is that it is to avoid not simply a trilemma but a quatrolemma if the Court please of self accusation, perjury and contempt and the possibility of prosecution.","start":794.403,"stop":812.532,"duration":18.13},{"text":"I would submit that Brown versus Walker deals with that dilemma or that quatrolemma as I prefer to call it.","start":812.532,"stop":822.756,"duration":10.22},{"text":"Very succinctly and poignantly and remember this is in 1896 when the Court there is talking about the policies which gave rise to the Fifth Amendment and it observed that if an accused person be asked to explain his apparent connection with the crime under investigation, the ease with which the question has put to him may assume an inquisitorial character, the temptation to press the witness unduly to (Inaudible) him, if he be timid or reluctant, to push him into a corner and to entrap him.","start":822.756,"stop":858.331,"duration":35.58},{"text":"To entrap him into fatal contradictions which is so painfully evident in many of the early state trials made the systems so audios as to give rise to a demand for its total abolition.","start":858.331,"stop":870.89,"duration":12.56},{"text":"In the context of this case, I would respectfully submit in response to a question that was posed to counsel this morning.","start":870.89,"stop":877.887,"duration":7},{"text":"That the accused here does not hold exclusively the keys to his jail door.","start":877.887,"stop":887.621,"duration":9.73},{"text":"On the contrary, it is like anyone who has money and has a safety deposit box, he shares that with the bank and so here, the accused shares the keys with the government.","start":887.621,"stop":899.787,"duration":12.17},{"text":"For well it is true that he can talk and thus open the door of contempt that has confined him in contempt.","start":899.787,"stop":907.362,"duration":7.57},{"text":"The government holds the key as to whether his talking may lead to a desire to prosecute him and therefore I submit that when we are talking about quatrolemmal, we are not talking about the policy and the privilege, we have to consider this possibility as well.","start":907.362,"stop":926.573,"duration":19.21},{"text":"We have to consider what was said by this Court in another cases.","start":926.573,"stop":930.825,"duration":4.25},{"text":"The choice here that the accused has between the rock and whirlpool multiplied.","start":930.825,"stop":935.949,"duration":5.12},{"text":"And there is another consideration to Court please and that is the basic respect which this society has for the inviolability of the person and his privacy as the Court noted.","start":935.949,"stop":948.892,"duration":12.94},{"text":"In Mallory versus Hogan as it noted.","start":948.892,"stop":950.559,"duration":1.67},{"text":"In Miranda versus Arizona and it is certainly noted long ago in the Boyd case when it observed that any compulsory discovery by extorting the parties oath or compelling the production of his private books and papers to convict him of a crime or deport that his poverty certainly is a principle that merges into the Fourth and the Fifth Amendment.","start":950.559,"stop":971.09,"duration":20.53},{"text":"And another point, we have here in our society a preference for the prosecutorial system, for the accusatorial system, which places the burden entirely on the government, and not for the inquisitorial process, which I would respectfully submit certainly in the context of this case.","start":971.09,"stop":993.896,"duration":22.81},{"text":"It takes place in the grand jury room where the accused is without a lawyer.","start":993.896,"stop":998.762,"duration":4.87},{"text":"Where he has no protection whatsoever but where he is faced with a lawyer.","start":998.762,"stop":1004.551,"duration":5.79},{"text":"And I would respectfully submit that given the secrecy which attends all grand jury proceedings and the secrecy which prevails thereafter as the decisions of this Court have made quite apparent in many cases, that it will be extremely, the accused will be extremely hard put not to feel a sense of entrapment by the circumstances which attempt the use immunity situation.","start":1004.551,"stop":1030.406,"duration":25.85},{"text":"But there is one additional consideration which I think underscores the Fifth Amendment as I read the cases of this Court and that is the notion of a sense of fair play which requires the government to let the individual alone unless it has reasonable cause to justify intruding upon him.","start":1030.406,"stop":1049.051,"duration":18.64},{"text":"Now, as I pointed out earlier in my comments, This statute gives the accused no opportunity whatsoever nor indeed the Court to inquire whether there was reasonable cause to peruse his privacy or indeed his defenses and allows the government to ransack his defenses as the accused is not permitted to do with respect to government files.","start":1049.051,"stop":1074.898,"duration":25.85},{"text":"Now, I would respectfully submit that there is other considerations.","start":1074.898,"stop":1081.186,"duration":6.29},{"text":"That for example the protection of the innocent even though some guilty may benefit incidentally, that is a choice.","start":1081.186,"stop":1090.808,"duration":9.62},{"text":"That is a choice which government makes in the context list of this kind of statute and it is a choice which is made upon the circumstance that if the accused has something that it wants to have badly, then the government should be put to the choice as it was put to the choice in Rosairo, as it was put to the choice in Andolshek and Coplin and a number of other cases, it has got to choose.","start":1090.808,"stop":1117.824,"duration":27.02},{"text":"If it wants to have information, then it will have the information that avoid prosecution.","start":1117.824,"stop":1124.364,"duration":6.54},{"text":"But if it wants to prosecute, then prosecute and let the privilege remain the sanctuary of the individual who is presumed to be innocent.","start":1124.364,"stop":1134.255,"duration":9.89}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E. Burger","textObjs":[{"text":"And then you think there is, is there any empirical data had been assembled by anyone, any significant way to show how many persons who have been granted immunity in exchange of a testimony had there after been prosecuted and have these problems that you are discussing?","start":1134.255,"stop":1153.126,"duration":18.87}]},{"speakerName":"Hugh R. Manes","textObjs":[{"text":"No sir, I mean, I am not aware of any empirical data and as a matter of fact I suspect one reason maybe because use immunity is still somewhat new, this statute was only passed last Fall.","start":1153.126,"stop":1163.872,"duration":10.75}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

the difficulties are not going to compound with use immunity but I do not hold any empirical data in the Court.","start":1166.769,"stop":1187.997,"duration":21.23},{"text":"Finally, I want to submit one other additional consideration to this Court for policy consideration, and that is the respect for law and the orderly process of administration that comes with the idea that a man cannot be compelled to accuse himself and which will be undermined when there is even the suspicion that an accused has been given, that there maybe some evidence that is being used to taint his trial that has come from his own mouth.","start":1187.997,"stop":1224.503,"duration":36.51},{"text":"I remember reading somewhere, I think it was in Moore versus Dempsey where Mr. Justice Holmes once said that it is

consideration.","start":1224.503,"stop":1239.913,"duration":15.41},{"text":"Now, I am not going to here debate, the question whether Counselman ought to is dicta it is not -- I take the position it is

point out to this Court that there have been a -- the Ninth Circuit affirmed of the use immunity statute here, that has not been true in a Seventh Circuit, that has not been true in the Third Circuit, citation to the Satina case, Satina versus Elias being in the 449 F 2, page 40 and more recently just recently, the Eighth Circuit also took the view that the Ninth Circuit was an error and viewed, viewed the underlying policy considerations of Counselmen as prevailing and I refer here to United States versus McDaniel 449 f 2 832 at page 838.","start":1253.821,"stop":1299.442,"duration":45.62},{"text":"That case incidentally is kind of interesting because it addresses itself to one of the questions that was put to counsel early this morning.","start":1299.442,"stop":1306.937,"duration":7.49},{"text":"When counsel was asked about weather he was overzealous, whether a prosecutor was going to be overzealous.","start":1306.937,"stop":1313.38,"duration":6.44},{"text":"In that particular case, I would point out that counsel there was the federal prosecutor who because he was informed by his administrative agencies that there was a suspicion that a bank president was defalcating and embezzling monies.","start":1313.38,"stop":1328.633,"duration":15.25},{"text":"Turn the matter over to a State to the state of North or South Dakota and the State then held an immunity grand jury proceeding, on the ground of immunity and then at the request of the United States Attorney, turned that transcript over to the United States Attorney for prosecution and indictment followed.","start":1328.633,"stop":1346.804,"duration":18.17},{"text":"I would say that the Court there held, that that was prime facie evidence of the use of fruits but I would also point out that it demonstrates as does of course, the Berger in 295 U.S. and number of other cases demonstrates that prosecutors can be at times overzealous and particularly when conferred with such extensive power as appears to be the case here.","start":1346.804,"stop":1369.749,"duration":22.94},{"text":"But when I first spoke, I suggested that there were other compelling reasons why I believe use immunity should not prevail and one of the most important of those reasons of course is that it is inadequate, that the rules that are designed to enforce and administer the use immunity concept are just simply unable to effectively displace the Fifth Amendment.","start":1369.749,"stop":1392.037,"duration":22.29},{"text":"In short, what I content, what we contented in our briefs is that that the rules that are designed to protect the Fourth and Fifth Amendment in search and seizure cases and in the forced confession case are simply not adequate to protect or to at least define the limits of the Fifth Amendment.","start":1392.037,"stop":1416.297,"duration":24.26},{"text":"In short, what is happening here, what is being argued for here is the use of essentially procedural rules to define the substantive rights of a witness and I submit that that cannot be done without creating some terrible problems for an accused who is questioning whether the evidence used against him in a subsequent prosecution had this tainted.","start":1416.297,"stop":1443.11,"duration":26.81},{"text":"Let me suggest some concrete examples of what I am referring to in this concept.","start":1443.11,"stop":1449.993,"duration":6.88},{"text":"First of all, California, the California Supreme Court decided in People versus Dickson 57 Cal 2 at page 415, that was a forced confession case and it held there that the fruits of a forced confession were not admissible but it went on to hold that the fruits of a forced confession may not be admissible but that if the evidence was discoverable, was discoverable by law enforcement that therefore that under those circumstances there was an attenuation and that evidence would be admissible.","start":1449.993,"stop":1487.129,"duration":37.14},{"text":"And that same theory that was used in the Dickson case and in subsequent California Supreme Court cases, and the case of like
