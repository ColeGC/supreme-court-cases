income.","start":479.066,"stop":484.497,"duration":5.43},{"text":"Since it’s impossible for the Texas AFDC family to use that income to get closer and closer to the standard of need because the way Texas applies the percentage reduction is it applies it for the standard first and then it subtracts outside income.","start":484.497,"stop":499.253,"duration":14.76},{"text":"No AFDC family in Texas could ever end up with more than 50% of its needs.","start":499.253,"stop":505.43,"duration":6.18},{"text":"So it has, it does not have that work incentive feature the Maryland Family maximum and
