by as calling him in and seeing if he would voluntarily answer questions.","start":640.986,"stop":670.092,"duration":29.11},{"text":"Instead, they resorted to the technique of taking a Negro police

able to get the petitioner to start talking in little bits and phrases about the case and then it really was not until in the wee small hours of Sunday morning that as Officer Langford describes it himself, the petitioner broke down under this continuous pressure and told, as Officer Langford states it, the full story about why he went into the river, saying that he had gone in the river in
