taking this particular step in this case.","start":482.92,"stop":492.445,"duration":9.52},{"text":"Our second position is, that Article 6 of the Constitution which provides for a constitutional oath of office for elected officials in the United States read together with Amendment Number 1 has to mean that at most in terms of political credentials, speech and association credentials of candidates

believe that this, although is not the holding of the Court in the case of Bond versus Floyd involving access to the legislature in the State of Georgia and it is not of course the holding of the case

unfortunately, it is a decision of Chief Justice Vanderbilt of the New Jersey Supreme Court and its reference is 71 Atlantic second 352, three New Jersey 578, in which Chief Justice Vanderbilt faced

federal and state constitution.","start":585.675,"stop":624.277,"duration":38.6},{"text":"The Court ruled quite clearly that the constitutional oath requirement brooked no additions, whatsoever.","start":624.277,"stop":633.746,"duration":9.47},{"text":"On this point, the Court might also refer to Shub v. Simpson which is cited in our brief.","start":633.746,"stop":638.557,"duration":4.81},{"text":"The Maryland Court of Appeals decision, although it disavowed the Imbrie case so far as state offices are concerned, it clearly accepted the Imbrie rationale on a preemption basis so far as federal elected officers are concerned.","start":638.557,"stop":657.773,"duration":19.22},{"text":"Now, in addition to our first two points, we have a number which are perhaps more fully briefed in our brief.","start":657.773,"stop":668.013,"duration":10.24},{"text":"The third point on constitutionality of this Ohio provision pertains to the statutes invasion of the right to political association.","start":668.013,"stop":678.708,"duration":10.69},{"text":"The statute does not even screen candidates as such.","start":678.708,"stop":683.299,"duration":4.59},{"text":"It is not a requirement that a candidate execute an oath which was precisely the question before this Court in the Guinn case of which the District Court below made much.","start":683.299,"stop":696.129,"duration":12.83},{"text":"That’s not the case, the question in this case.","start":696.129,"stop":700.046,"duration":3.92},{"text":"What we have here is a statute which presumes to screen political congeries, associations, groups and parties and to keep them off of the ballot.","start":700.046,"stop":710.862,"duration":10.82},{"text":"We will submit the cases like Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Committee and NAACP v. Alabama would suggest that such a statute is at least constitutionally presumptively unconstitutional.","start":710.862,"stop":726.814,"duration":15.95},{"text":"In addition, since the statute requires that 10 members of the party whether candidates or not, only three of whom are to the offices of the party must execute the affidavit, there is a direct invasion of the associational rights of those individuals as indicated in the Shelton and Bates decisions and the decisions involving the Subversive Activities Control Act and the registration requirements for communist action organizations, Albertson v. CP and the like.","start":726.814,"stop":764.804,"duration":37.99},{"text":"This statute in addition is unconstitutionally overbroad.","start":764.804,"stop":770.835,"duration":6.03},{"text":"It is

that point and I won’t go over the statute on its face in terms of the overbreadth.","start":780.821,"stop":788.452,"duration":7.63},{"text":"The State does suggest that the statute is still constitutional on its face, but the District Court below certainly held to the contrary.","start":788.452,"stop":795.955,"duration":7.5},{"text":"We submit that even as construed by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the Beck case, the statute is unconstitutionally broad and indeed the District Court below misread the Supreme Court of Ohio’s decision.","start":795.955,"stop":812.726,"duration":16.77},{"text":"It is our position that the Supreme Court of Ohio in narrowing the statute only narrowed it to the point of drawing a distinction between violence or engaging in violence, but including in that category mere advocacy of violence or violent overthrow, and on the other hand, peaceable change as through use of the amendment process.","start":812.726,"stop":838.273,"duration":25.55},{"text":"A careful reading of the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio, I think, will make that clear.","start":838.273,"stop":843.534,"duration":5.26},{"text":"In addition, I think that although there are no other Ohio Supreme Court decisions on point, there are a number of Ohio lower court decisions dealing with analogous statutes which seemed to indicate as well that their understanding of the law in Ohio was -- that the distinction being drawn is between violence including mere advocacy and peaceable change.","start":843.534,"stop":865.269,"duration":21.74},{"text":"Even as construed as interpreted by the District Court below, however, the statue remains unconstitutionally broad.","start":865.269,"stop":874.927,"duration":9.66},{"text":"Again, to a large extent, this point has taken up in our argument I just mentioned the two most notable aspects of the overbreadth statute as construed by the District Court.","start":874.927,"stop":888.913,"duration":13.99},{"text":"Fourth, the District Court in its narrowing construction of statutes speaks of the party knowingly associated or associating with a group attempting to overthrow Government by force or violence.","start":888.913,"stop":909.208,"duration":20.29},{"text":"We submit that the use of the term knowingly associated is two-open ended even though this term itself two-open ended, in addition, we submit that this criterion established by the District Court does not take account of numerous decisions of this Court which hold that mere knowing association membership in or participation in a group which is engaged in or advocating violent overthrow is not enough.","start":909.208,"stop":940.267,"duration":31.06},{"text":"There must be specific intent on the part of the person or in this case party associating to further or fulfill the unlawful goals of the organization which is engaged in the unlawful act or advocacy.","start":940.267,"stop":956.105,"duration":15.84}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Not when I gather Mr. Rosen, you

Rosen","textObjs":[{"text":"We don’t extend the overbreadth argument to such.","start":968.839,"stop":971.615,"duration":2.78},{"text":"I do extend the next point which of course is a vagueness point to points one and two.","start":971.615,"stop":978.832,"duration":7.22},{"text":"I must say to the extent that I understand what number one means, the party is not engaged in an attempt to overthrow the Government by force or violence.","start":978.832,"stop":988.409,"duration":9.58},{"text":"It would be difficult for us to argue that that is overbroad, assuming that this inquiry can be made or this investigation can be made and we do not conceive that.","start":988.409,"stop":998.61,"duration":10.2},{"text":"It seems a silly thing to ask somebody to make an affidavit about since it is speaking of the immediate present and this instant and has no reference to future behavior activity, but I suppose we couldn’t say it is overbroad if anything, it is incredibly narrow.","start":998.61,"stop":1015.545,"duration":16.93},{"text":"However, we do think that there may be some vagaries involved in that particular language.","start":1015.545,"stop":1026.8,"duration":11.25},{"text":"Excuse me.","start":1026.8,"stop":1030.082,"duration":3.28},{"text":"Less in a point one, except this red with the statute itself than in the point two, the party does not carry on a program of sedition or treason as defined by the criminal law.","start":1030.082,"stop":1043.083,"duration":13},{"text":"Well, I supposed we know what treason means under the criminal law.","start":1043.083,"stop":1049.655,"duration":6.57},{"text":"I assume, and I think the Court would assume that treason would be limited by Article 3 of the

confession.","start":1049.655,"stop":1068.304,"duration":18.65},{"text":"And indeed, I believe there is an Ohio statute on treason though I don’t know that it has ever been enforced.","start":1068.304,"stop":1074.701,"duration":6.4},{"text":"However, there is no sedition law in Ohio.","start":1074.701,"stop":1078.429,"duration":3.73},{"text":"The closes thing to a sedition law in Ohio was the Criminal Syndicalism Act which this Court declared was unconstitutional in Brandenburg versus Ohio.","start":1078.429,"stop":1088.946,"duration":10.52},{"text":"There is no referent in Ohio jurisprudence at all for meaning for the term sedition and of course this Court has recognized – I’ve had the reference to your language Mr. Justice Brennan on the difficulty the

statute.","start":1112.159,"stop":1127.709,"duration":15.55},{"text":"But again, we do not agree that the District Court was correct in its construction in light of the Supreme Court of Ohio’s view.","start":1127.709,"stop":1134.306,"duration":6.6},{"text":"We think it’s perfectly clear further that the vagueness that’s found on the statute and the overbreadth is incredibly magnified by the deprivations of due process of law in a procedural sense that are found in the statute.","start":1134.306,"stop":1150.458,"duration":16.15},{"text":"First is a burden of going forward which is placed immediately upon the party.","start":1150.458,"stop":1156.129,"duration":5.67},{"text":"The statute requires that an affidavit be submitted on behalf of the political party or
