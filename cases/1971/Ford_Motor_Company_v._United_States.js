from the judgment of the District Court in Detroit holding that the acquisition in 1961 by Ford Motor Company of the spark plug business and the name of the Autolite Company to enable Ford to supply its own needs for original installation of spark plugs and also to supply replacement plugs to others and the acquisition occurred after Ford had been the customer of Champion, a leading company in the business for 50 years.","start":32.692,"stop":71.436,"duration":38.74},{"text":"The Court held that the acquisition violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act.","start":71.436,"stop":77.414,"duration":5.98},{"text":"He directed divestiture and then ended seven other extraordinary injunctions.","start":77.414,"stop":86.308,"duration":8.89},{"text":"First, he enjoined Ford from going into the business of making spark plugs by internal entry for 10 years.","start":86.308,"stop":97.696,"duration":11.39},{"text":"The judgment enjoined Ford from making any plugs under its own name for five years, not marketing any plugs under its own name for five years and required Ford to buy half its requirements for five years from the purchaser of the divested -- the portion divested.","start":97.696,"stop":126.331,"duration":28.64},{"text":"When the case was tried, batteries were also involved, but they dropped out and they are not now involved, that matter having been satisfactory disposed of.","start":126.331,"stop":137.675,"duration":11.34},{"text":"Ford challenges the decision of the District Court as to the violation and submits that even if there was a violation, divestiture in this case was not the best remedy because other remedies which I will mention were better and challenges all the extraordinary injunctions with particular weight on the injunction against the internal entry and the injunction against the use of the Ford name which it regards as definitely anticompetitive.","start":137.675,"stop":175.516,"duration":37.84},{"text":"Now, I think it is important to understand the nature of this industry because as in other cases, the impact of Section 7 depends on the nature of the industry in a particular situation involved.","start":175.516,"stop":189.864,"duration":14.35},{"text":"General Motors has made its own spark plugs since 1909.","start":189.864,"stop":198.239,"duration":8.38},{"text":"In that year, it acquired the then Champion spark plug business and had since marketed its spark plug under the name of AC, under the letters AC and at the time of the acquisition, General Motors had 30% of the spark plug market.","start":198.239,"stop":215.97,"duration":17.73},{"text":"When I say the spark plug market, I am talking for the most part about the, not the original installations but the market, in the so-called after-market, the replacement plugs, that is where the large amount of the plug business is done.","start":215.97,"stop":233.114,"duration":17.14},{"text":"Champion went back into the spark plug business after selling to General Motors and has supplied or had at the time of that acquisition, supplied Ford for 50 years.","start":233.114,"stop":245.607,"duration":12.49},{"text":"And in 1936, Autolite came into the business and began to supply Chrysler and Champion got 50% of the business, it had 50% of the business at the time of the acquisition, that is General Motors 30, Champion 50, and Autolite about 15, and the balance of few percent was sort of -- were spread among small manufactures mostly in the private brand market.","start":245.607,"stop":282.54,"duration":36.93},{"text":"Now, the private brand market is the market served by such companies as Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery Ward and other mass merchandisers and some of the oil companies who market spark plugs under their own trade names.","start":282.54,"stop":297.95,"duration":15.41},{"text":"In 1960 to 1961, in those years, Chrysler got very concerned, I mean, Autolite got very concerned because it saw signs that Chrysler might be getting ready to go into the spark plug business itself and that might leave it with an expensive plant which the Court described, below described as a potential albatross if it could not do something about it.","start":297.95,"stop":327.463,"duration":29.51},{"text":"And so it came to Ford and offered to sell the spark plug business to Ford and the Autolite name for spark plugs and other uses.","start":327.463,"stop":340.138,"duration":12.67},{"text":"And they worked out a deal under which Ford brought this assets including the battery assets which are no longer involved for a total of $28 million and Autolite became Eltra.","start":340.138,"stop":355.036,"duration":14.9},{"text":"So that there was a new company with a name of Eltra created which carried on the portion of the business not sold by Autolite to Ford and Eltra has built a spark plug plant in Alabama and is in the business of supplying spark plugs largely for the private brand market.","start":355.036,"stop":379.556,"duration":24.52},{"text":"Ford, in connection with the sale agreed to buy 12 million plugs from Eltra over a period of two years and also to provide it with certain ceramic parts and thereupon Ford was in the business under the Autolite name.","start":379.556,"stop":400.905,"duration":21.35},{"text":"Champion became Chrysler’s supplier and took part of -- a large part of the year to change over from Champion plugs to Autolite plugs and worked out the technical difficulties involved and also to begin the process of improving the distribution systems and it took about the same for Chrysler to get started with its new supplier, Champion.","start":400.905,"stop":432.917,"duration":32.01},{"text":"At the time of the acquisition or just before the acquisition, Ford had some 14% of the spark plug business and after the acquisition, Ford's percentage gradually came up and Champion’s went down and General Motor’s remained about the same, although it has gone up a little bit.","start":432.917,"stop":458.945,"duration":26.03}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

Autolite was about 15.","start":466.568,"stop":476.934,"duration":10.37},{"text":"And when Ford came in, the Autolite business began to go up so that by -- about 19 -- in the late 1960s, Ford’s business was up to about 19% and Champion’s business had come down from 50 to about 40 and General Motors had remained about the same, perhaps gone up a little bit.","start":476.934,"stop":502.099,"duration":25.16},{"text":"It is not correct as the Government suggests that this was all automatic, that all happened was that the Champions business went down and the Autolite business went up and Chrysler was changing suppliers.","start":502.099,"stop":517.697,"duration":15.6},{"text":"There was active and intense competition in the after-market and it was a result of that competition that these changes and percentages took place through, it seemed like relatively small changes in percentage but each percentage point was about 4 million plugs and it is a substantial amount of business where involving thousands and thousands of transactions.","start":517.697,"stop":545.811,"duration":28.11},{"text":"The -- I think Your Honors will be satisfied when I finish describing the industry that historically there have been, since 1936, only three major suppliers to the automobile companies and that before that, there were only two and that the business does not accommodate itself to more than three major suppliers.","start":545.811,"stop":572.612,"duration":26.8},{"text":"There is this private market business, but inevidently there are in this business I think there is room only for three major suppliers and that is because of the special nature of the plug in the business which are not joined to.","start":572.612,"stop":589.346,"duration":16.73},{"text":"Without going into any detail of the mechanics, the spark plug is a small but essential part of an automobile and the truck and also used in tractors and long-horse and so on.","start":589.346,"stop":602.385,"duration":13.04},{"text":"It has, as you know two electrodes.","start":602.385,"stop":606.181,"duration":3.8},{"text":"It is inserted in the cylinder to jump a spark caused by power from the generator to ignite the mixture of oil and gasoline and air in the cylinder and cause the explosion which drives the engine.","start":606.181,"stop":623.41,"duration":17.23},{"text":"The plugs are carefully engineered to particular mix and models.","start":623.41,"stop":629.736,"duration":6.33},{"text":"It takes the plug manufacturers and the automobile manufacturers work closely together over a long period of time to get just the right form and construction of the plug and to make it deal most effectively with the particular model for which it is used.","start":629.736,"stop":648.921,"duration":19.19},{"text":"Just as an example, I think Ford now makes some 80 different motors and has 80 different plugs for those motors.","start":648.921,"stop":658.72,"duration":9.8},{"text":"The use of the wrong plug can cause malfunctioning, affect the exhaust fumes from the engine and could cause serious damage.","start":658.72,"stop":673.634,"duration":14.91},{"text":"Now, the plugs are installed at the factory in what is called OE Installation, that is Original Equipment Installation and the automobile manufacturer buys or makes these plugs and they are put in the car and then the car is sold and about 18 months after the car is sold, the average kind of owner goes around and gets a tune up and has a replacement of the plugs.","start":673.634,"stop":705.819,"duration":32.18},{"text":"And the plugs are replaced about five times during the use of the average automobile and that means that on a six-cylinder car, there are 30 plugs that are bought over that period, on eight-cylinder 40 plugs.","start":705.819,"stop":721.014,"duration":15.2},{"text":"The facts I am stating I think there is no dispute about -- were at one about, think the nature of the market and the facts about the market and indeed many of them are stipulated.","start":721.014,"stop":734.243,"duration":13.23},{"text":"Most replacement plugs are inserted by mechanics in the course of a tune-up.","start":734.243,"stop":741.165,"duration":6.92},{"text":"One does not ordinarily take his car around and says, I need a new spark plug, but usually he is going to a garage or a service station or some other place to have the car tuned-up and gone over and at that time that the mechanic ordinarily inserts the new plugs.","start":741.165,"stop":759.768,"duration":18.6},{"text":"And the new plugs are such a minor part of the cost of that operation that really price and cost of the plugs to the customer are no moment so that there is little if any price competition at that level.","start":759.768,"stop":775.312,"duration":15.54},{"text":"The mechanic --","start":775.312,"stop":776.669,"duration":1.36}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, the

installed.","start":791.212,"stop":800.55,"duration":9.34},{"text":"This propensity of mechanics to use the plug originally installed is called in this record sometimes the OE type which merely means the propensity of mechanics to use the same plug in replacement that was there originally and he does this because he knows about the fact that the plug was originally designed for that car and he does not want to take into risk about it.","start":800.55,"stop":825.002,"duration":24.45},{"text":"He does not want to think that he is smarter than the engineering department that designed it.","start":825.002,"stop":831.029,"duration":6.03},{"text":"Now, there are all purpose plugs manufactured by all of these companies and the average garage man or service station man stocks some of the plugs, but usually not all the plugs.","start":831.029,"stop":849.034,"duration":18},{"text":"Usually, if the record shows that sometimes the garage owner or the filling station owner has only the AC plug or sometimes the Champion plug, but usually both of those because they are so popular and then at the time of this acquisition, probably few of these places also stock the Autolite plugs and one of the great efforts here in the competitive struggle has been to get more and more of these places to stock the Autolite plug.","start":849.034,"stop":888.304,"duration":39.27},{"text":"If they

Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"And then if as you tell us it was the habit or practice of mechanics to install as replacement plugs, the original equipment plugs, why would they have stocked all three just in the ordinary course of business because of the so-called big three automobiles?","start":916.006,"stop":933.886,"duration":17.88}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, generally speaking there are perhaps two reasons as far as the Autolite plug and the Ford Champion plug to take that first.","start":933.886,"stop":944.491,"duration":10.61},{"text":"Ford, tried to distribute these plugs through its franchise dealers and the franchise dealers were no longer handling at or about the time of the acquisition as many of the installations as the filling stations and others.","start":944.491,"stop":960.354,"duration":15.86},{"text":"And the filling station proprietors and the garage proprietors were concerned about not having too large an inventory and actually they would maintain an inventory which would do the best job in supplying plugs for the largest possible number without too much of an investment.","start":960.354,"stop":976.332,"duration":15.98},{"text":"So there was a tendency to have a major lines and the Autolite line had difficulty getting in as indicated by the fact that between about the time of the acquisition in the late 1960s, the percentage of Ford sales in the aftermarket crept up some 5% which I think is represented by the increase stocking of these plugs in the market.","start":976.332,"stop":1003.071,"duration":26.74},{"text":"Now, the -- I mentioned the all purpose plug, all these companies make all purpose plugs so that if the mechanic does not have the OE plug at the time, he can try to do the best he can by using an all purpose plug which is a sort of a compromise.","start":1003.071,"stop":1023.555,"duration":20.48},{"text":"It is not as good as many people think as the OE plug, but it is better than a plug that was made for a wholly different kind of a car and that is a kind of compromise solution.","start":1023.555,"stop":1034.181,"duration":10.63}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E. Burger","textObjs":[{"text":"Did I read somewhere in the record that there have been testimony to the effect that most of the filling stations did not appear to want to carry more than two different brands?","start":1034.181,"stop":1046.925,"duration":12.74}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"That was so for a long time and the business are trying to get them to carry three took a lot of effort and that is what went off.","start":1046.925,"stop":1053.599,"duration":6.67},{"text":"Now, the OE use is of such importance to the manufacturer that Champion, beginning in 1920, started what is now as the six cent OE price, it began to sell the plugs for original installation at 6 cents and then everybody -- all the manufacturers followed soon so that all the plugs were original equipment installation were sold at 6 cents and the cost of the plugs was three or four times as much as that.","start":1053.599,"stop":1089.845,"duration":36.25},{"text":"So that the manufacturer used this low OE price to get in and get the business and then he had to make up for the loss on that sale by a higher price on the sales for the aftermarket, the replacement plugs.","start":1089.845,"stop":1107.284,"duration":17.44},{"text":"And so this is a very important part of the getting into the business and holding the business and is a fact of life which is unusual in this industry I think.","start":1107.284,"stop":1119.331,"duration":12.05},{"text":"The -- I have already mentioned the fact that because of the fact that the plugs are originally installed as part of other work, that their prices of little or no moment and this and one of the reasons of the price in the business has been so stable is that in 1953, all of the plug manufacturers had cases before the Federal Trade Commission which involved the question of whether they could distinguish in price between the various types of distributors who distributed their plugs including the other companies who wanted to distribute their plugs and the Federal Trade Commission held that they had to give the same price to everybody in the distribution chain and this has naturally kept the plug manufacturers from lowering their price because if they did, they had to do it to everybody and therefore they could not do it in the ordinary competitive way.","start":1119.331,"stop":1184.813,"duration":65.48},{"text":"The court below regarded one of the important factors as to whether or not the Champion or the Ford’s relation to Champion tended to moderate Champion’s price and he held that it did and it was his view that somehow Ford being a large customer of Champion, moderated Champion’s price.","start":1184.813,"stop":1217.468,"duration":32.65},{"text":"Now, on this record that is just a theory.","start":1217.468,"stop":1221.971,"duration":4.5},{"text":"There was no proof and there is nothing in this record to show that there was any such moderation.","start":1221.971,"stop":1228.813,"duration":6.84},{"text":"I would take it that the original equipment price given 50 years ago is hardly a moderation which should still persist in any realistic sense at the time of the acquisition.","start":1228.813,"stop":1241.163,"duration":12.35},{"text":"It was really not a moderation that was a sort of a payment for entrance or an arrangement for entrance and aside from that the record does not show any moderation.","start":1241.163,"stop":1252.23,"duration":11.07},{"text":"Ford had to pay a higher price in 1959 and 1960 for its plugs than other people did and there is not any evidence of moderation.","start":1252.23,"stop":1264.361,"duration":12.13},{"text":"The suggestion is made that the Court examined this carefully that Ford was a potential competitor and that under Penn-Olin, somehow this acquisition was bad.","start":1264.361,"stop":1283.578,"duration":19.22},{"text":"Now, the Court took testimony and the government tried very hard to try to show that Ford was on the verge of entering this business, but the evidence the Court found did not show that Ford was on the brink of entering this business.","start":1283.578,"stop":1301.095,"duration":17.52},{"text":"There are certain memoranda in the record which indicate that there was a study made to that subject, several studies but they never reached the point of top level consideration and the reason they did not was that, and the testimony of Mr. Duffy in the record which the Court accepted, was that plugs were available to Ford for OE Installation at one-third of cost.","start":1301.095,"stop":1331.358,"duration":30.26},{"text":"Ford did not have at that time any engineers who were expert in the plug business or even in the ceramic business that they had no distribution system which was adequate at that time to enable them to compete effectively in the aftermarket and then the undisputed evidence is and the Court recognized it and everybody recognized it, that after an original OE installation of a new plug, it takes five to eight years to have enough vehicles on the road with that plug in them to really do a lot of business in the aftermarket.","start":1331.358,"stop":1375,"duration":43.64},{"text":"And so anybody

Ford a -- Ford was a stronger and more effective competitor than Autolite had been, where there were three companies before the acquisition, the creation of Eltra after the -- in connection with the

entrant, it still moderated Champion’s price and also the fact that the acquisition somehow foreclosed competition and perhaps also increased barriers to entry as a ground upon which it decided the Section 7 case adversely to Ford.","start":1535.221,"stop":1568.496,"duration":33.28},{"text":"Now, as I have said, there is no evidence in this record of moderation of Champions’ prices.","start":1568.496,"stop":1574.747,"duration":6.25},{"text":"There is no foreclosure of anybody, but Champion, and Champion has had to simply get out and compete in a different

absorbed and there was no substitute as there was here for the absorption.","start":1597.656,"stop":1611.144,"duration":13.49},{"text":"Here, the acquisition gave rise to a stronger competitor and as
