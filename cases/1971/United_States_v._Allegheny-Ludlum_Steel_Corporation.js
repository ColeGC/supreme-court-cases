Pennsylvania.","start":28.41,"stop":35.152,"duration":6.74},{"text":"The question presented is whether the District Court erred in adjoining the enforcement of two car service rules adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission to govern the movement of freight cars.","start":35.152,"stop":48.363,"duration":13.21},{"text":"The rules were promulgated under Section 1 (14) (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act which authorizes the Commission to establish reasonable rules with respect to car service.","start":48.363,"stop":62.071,"duration":13.71},{"text":"For more than a century, railroads have freely interchanged freight cars so that freight could be shipped from point of origin to point of destination on a single car.","start":62.071,"stop":72.209,"duration":10.14},{"text":"To govern the return of freight cars through their owners, railroads as early as 1902, adopted a code of car service rules.","start":72.209,"stop":82.43,"duration":10.22},{"text":"Similar rules are now published by appellee, the American Association of Railroads for AAR and virtually all railroads in the country have agreed to abide by that.","start":82.43,"stop":94.842,"duration":12.41},{"text":"The railroads Record of Compliance with the AAR car service rules however has been poor particularly during times of general freight car shortage.","start":94.842,"stop":104.968,"duration":10.13},{"text":"The Commission in this case determined that a number of the AAR rules should be enforced and thus adapted them verbatim as Commission rules.","start":104.968,"stop":115.431,"duration":10.46},{"text":"The two rules here under attack, rules 1 and 2, generally require that unloaded freight cars be returned either empty or loaded in the direction of the railroads owning the cars.","start":115.431,"stop":129.289,"duration":13.86},{"text":"Freight car shortages have been a serious and recurring problem throughout most of this century.","start":129.289,"stop":135.539,"duration":6.25},{"text":"In the 1940s for example, the Commission concluded after a general investigation that railroads as a group had failed to provide adequate freight car service.","start":135.539,"stop":146.581,"duration":11.04},{"text":"The Commission at that time did not adopt mandatory rules in the hopes that the railroad would take steps to solve the problem themselves.","start":146.581,"stop":156.353,"duration":9.77},{"text":"By the the 1960s however, it became apparent that the problem was getting worse.","start":156.353,"stop":161.432,"duration":5.08},{"text":"Clearly voluntary action by the railroads had not provided the solution.","start":161.432,"stop":167.149,"duration":5.72},{"text":"To meet the crisis, the Commission acted on a number of related fronts.","start":167.149,"stop":172.824,"duration":5.68},{"text":"These actions included adjusting their per diem charges that one railroad pays for the use of another's cars, enforcing the requirement that boxcars be free of debris when unloaded and the sponsoring remedial legislation.","start":172.824,"stop":189.33,"duration":16.51},{"text":"The Commission's attempt to add an incentive element in the per diem charges is a subject of another appeal pending before this Court, it's the Florida East Coast Railway appeal, no. 70-279.","start":189.33,"stop":209.302,"duration":19.97},{"text":"The instant case was initiated by the Commission to investigate all aspects of freight car shortages and to consider the prescription of mandatory car service rules.","start":209.302,"stop":220.869,"duration":11.57},{"text":"The evidence in this case showed that the total number of freight cars owned by railroads declined from 1955 to 1964 by more than 12%.","start":220.869,"stop":232.598,"duration":11.73},{"text":"While the individual capacity, the average capacity of individual cars increased during that period, the aggregate capacity of all cars also declined by 5%.","start":232.598,"stop":245.851,"duration":13.25},{"text":"The decline was shortest more than 22% with respect to plain boxcars.","start":245.851,"stop":252.079,"duration":6.23},{"text":"Plain boxcars which make up about one-third of the number of freight cars in the country are the workhorse of the car fleet.","start":252.079,"stop":264.436,"duration":12.36},{"text":"Many railroads and practically all the shippers participating in these proceedings acknowledge the existence of a chronic national freight car shortage.","start":264.436,"stop":273.829,"duration":9.39},{"text":"In fact, appellee, that's the National Industrial Traffic League testified, a witness testified that the number of freight cars in the long run should be doubled in order to meet the needs of the shippers.","start":273.829,"stop":288.749,"duration":14.92},{"text":"To combat the shortage and dislocation of freight cars, the Commission's Bureau of Operations proposed that certain car service rules be made mandatory.","start":288.749,"stop":299.61,"duration":10.86},{"text":"Appellees have attempted to paint a picture of virtual uniform opposition to the imposition of mandatory rules.","start":299.61,"stop":309.127,"duration":9.52},{"text":"In fact however, some railroads and more than some shippers testified that enforceable car service rules were needed.","start":309.127,"stop":321.545,"duration":12.42},{"text":"The strongest opposition to mandatory enforcement of car service rules came from the steel industry.","start":321.545,"stop":327.954,"duration":6.41},{"text":"Witnesses for the industry testified that steel companies have special problems with respect to the loading of freight cars.","start":327.954,"stop":335.311,"duration":7.36},{"text":"The companies introduced studies to show that full compliance with the car service rules 1 and 2 would be impractical.","start":335.311,"stop":343.013,"duration":7.7},{"text":"The same studies however which are cited at page 44 of the Steel appellees' brief, these same studies indicated that a vast improvement in the percentage of compliance with the car service rules was possible, albeit at some cost to the steel companies.","start":343.013,"stop":364.623,"duration":21.61},{"text":"On completion of the hearings, the examiner filed a report recommending discontinuance of the proceedings on the grounds that no shortage of freight cars existed and also on the ground that prescription of the car service rules for mandatory observance was unwarranted.","start":364.623,"stop":381.008,"duration":16.38}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Huntington, you told us earlier that the Commission moved on several related fronts in attacking this basic problem, one adjusting the per diem and another requiring that the debris be removed from cars before they were

place.","start":411.386,"stop":418.414,"duration":7.03},{"text":"In rejecting the examiner's conclusions the Commission fully analyzed the data on shortages and found that there is in fact a freight car shortage and the Commission also found that an alarmingly low percentage of freight cars are on the lines of their owners at any given time.","start":418.414,"stop":436.959,"duration":18.55},{"text":"The Commission concluded that because freight car owners have such little use of their cars, they are less able to meet the particular needs of their shippers and they have little incentive to spend money purchasing new cars or spend money to maintain their existing cars to high standards.","start":436.959,"stop":455.813,"duration":18.85},{"text":"The Commission therefore prescribed AAR Rules 1 and 2 among others for mandatory observance stating that the primary objective was to increase the availability of cars to their owners.","start":455.813,"stop":469.331,"duration":13.52},{"text":"In that way, railroads could better provide for their shippers and those railroads with deficient car supplies would be identified and compelled to purchase new cars.","start":469.331,"stop":480.268,"duration":10.94},{"text":"Rules 1 and 2 as adopted by the Commission, had a built-in exception provision.","start":480.268,"stop":485.243,"duration":4.98},{"text":"On petitions for reconsideration, the Commission adopted Rule 19 which established an additional procedure for obtaining exceptions.","start":485.243,"stop":503.695,"duration":18.45},{"text":"To determine the validity of the Commission's action here, the starting point is of course the statute Section 1 (14) (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.","start":503.695,"stop":514.226,"duration":10.53},{"text":"We have traced the legislative history of that section in our brief and I will not go into that here.","start":514.226,"stop":520.568,"duration":6.34},{"text":"The one point I would like to make, I would like to meet the appellee's contention that the statute was designed solely to deal with distribution problems of freight cars as opposed to problems of an inadequate number of freight cars.","start":520.568,"stop":536.736,"duration":16.17},{"text":"I would like to just make three points with respect to that.","start":536.736,"stop":540.638,"duration":3.9},{"text":"First, a look at the original Esch Act of which Section 1 (14) (a) was a part, shows that the act was indeed concerned with the supply of freight cars.","start":540.638,"stop":552.488,"duration":11.85},{"text":"The part of the original Act conferring emergency powers on the Commission, conditioned the exercise of such powers on a determination that an emergency exists in respect of the “supply or use” of cars.","start":552.488,"stop":569.642,"duration":17.15},{"text":"When later an additional provision which is now Section 1 (14) (a) was added to confer powers upon the Commission in non-emergency situations, the Congress simply did not put in that prerequisite requirement for a finding that there was an emergency, so the supply or use language was simply left out of that provision.","start":569.642,"stop":593.003,"duration":23.36},{"text":"Second point I would like to make is that the house report on the Esch Act which is cited at page 21 of our brief, clearly reflects a concern with the under equipment of the roads or the lack of sufficient cars.","start":593.003,"stop":608.698,"duration":15.69},{"text":"Finally, any doubt as to the coverage of the original Esch Act was removed in 1920.","start":608.698,"stop":614.034,"duration":5.34},{"text":"The original Act had defined car service to include the movement, distribution, exchange, interchange and return of cars.","start":614.034,"stop":621.629,"duration":7.6},{"text":"In 1920, the definition was amended to include the use, control, supply, movement etcetera of cars.","start":621.629,"stop":631.478,"duration":9.85},{"text":"The primary thrust of appellee's attack on the Commission's adoption of Rules 1 and 2 is that the Commission failed to make certain findings and failed to get proper attention to the adverse effects of it's order.","start":631.478,"stop":643.477,"duration":12},{"text":"It is claimed for example that the Commission should have made a finding with respect to the shortages on high ownership lines.","start":643.477,"stop":650.135,"duration":6.66},{"text":"I think, it would be useful here to define what I mean by high ownership lines.","start":650.135,"stop":655.008,"duration":4.87},{"text":"High ownership roads, as I shall use the term, are those which come relatively close to meeting their responsibilities to provide a fair share of the nation's freight cars.","start":655.008,"stop":666.474,"duration":11.47},{"text":"It's thus defined a high ownership railroad could be a small carrier owning in absolute terms a small number of cars provided that the carrier was meeting its general responsibility to provide a fair share of the nation's supply of cars.","start":666.474,"stop":682.569,"duration":16.09},{"text":"The District Court faltered the Commission for failing to find that freight car shortages were more acute on high ownership railroads than on low ownership railroads.","start":682.569,"stop":692.631,"duration":10.06},{"text":"Appellees appeared was -- assert more generally, that the Commission's order is defective since the Commission did not find that high ownership railroads have a need for the return of their car.","start":692.631,"stop":704.826,"duration":12.2},{"text":"In our view, there are several reasons why neither of these findings was necessary.","start":704.826,"stop":709.356,"duration":4.53},{"text":"First, as I have said, the purpose of the Commission's order was to increase the overall supply of freight cars.","start":709.356,"stop":716.868,"duration":7.51},{"text":"Clearly some railroads would have to purchase additional cars, while the order in general is expected to provide an incentive for all railroads to acquire cars, it in particular puts the onus on the low ownership lines, where it rightly should be.","start":716.868,"stop":735.708,"duration":18.84},{"text":"Second, even if there were no shortages on high ownership lines, enforcement of the rules would not necessarily create an excess or surplus of cars on those lines.","start":735.708,"stop":748.076,"duration":12.37},{"text":"While high ownership railroads will have their own cars returned to them more expeditiously, they in turn, of course, will have to return foreign cars on their systems to the owning roads.","start":748.076,"stop":760.091,"duration":12.01},{"text":"Finally, in the event that a surplus should develop on a particular railroad, the road could make the surplus cars available to other railroads who had a need for those cars.","start":760.091,"stop":771.977,"duration":11.89},{"text":"This could be down under the Exception Provision provided in Rules 1 and 2 and moreover the Commission always has the emergency authority under Section 115 of the Act to order the cars to ship -- to order any surplus car shipped to an area where they are needed.","start":771.977,"stop":792.571,"duration":20.59},{"text":"Appellees also assert that the Commission should have made a finding with respect to the financial capacity of low ownership railroads to acquire new equipment, but the Commission's order does not direct any particular railroad to purchase equipment.","start":792.571,"stop":807.618,"duration":15.05},{"text":"What it does do is to provide an incentive for railroads to purchase equipment.","start":807.618,"stop":813.157,"duration":5.54},{"text":"There are a variety of methods of financing new equipment many of which do not require substantial initial capital outlays.","start":813.157,"stop":822.064,"duration":8.91},{"text":"A witness for the Southern Pacific, for example, testified that that company had acquired a leasing corporation and was prepared to lease freight cars to railroads who were unable to purchase them outright.","start":822.064,"stop":840.847,"duration":18.78},{"text":"And a special provision in the Bankruptcy Act, which we have cited at page 30 of our brief, makes it possible for railroads undergoing reorganization to purchase new equipment.","start":840.847,"stop":851.804,"duration":10.96},{"text":"The Pan-Central, for example, has been able to acquire new equipment while it has been in reorganization and one of the railroads that supported the adoption of mandatory rules here, be then New York, New Haven and Hartford was itself in reorganization at the time of the proceedings.","start":851.804,"stop":873.468,"duration":21.66},{"text":"In general, the argument that specific findings should have been made with respect to shortages in financial capacity must be put in the context of what was and what was not possible in these proceedings.","start":873.468,"stop":886.485,"duration":13.02},{"text":"The Commission squarely acknowledged that it was unable to make findings of shortages on particular carriers.","start":886.485,"stop":894.024,"duration":7.54},{"text":"Obviously therefore, it could not make findings with respect to the financial ability of low ownership roads to acquire equipment.","start":894.024,"stop":902.225,"duration":8.2},{"text":"Yet the Commission could find and did find that the railroads as a whole did not own an adequate number of freight cars.","start":902.225,"stop":910.888,"duration":8.66},{"text":"To say that in spite of this finding, the Commission was powerless to act until every aspect of the shortage was fully analyzed and categorized, would be to restrict unduly the Commission's authority under Section 1 (14) (a) to meet shortages by adopting reasonable car service rules.","start":910.888,"stop":931.549,"duration":20.66},{"text":"Finally, appellees (Inaudible) the Commission for failing to find that the rules would in fact increase the supply of freight cars, but no one can predict exactly what the outcome of mandatory enforcement of these rules will be.","start":931.549,"stop":947.154,"duration":15.61},{"text":"The Commission's conclusion that it's order should have the effect of increasing supply, we submit was entirely reasonable and fully justified by its reasoning which is disclosed by its opinion.","start":947.154,"stop":960.315,"duration":13.16},{"text":"And finally the Commission recognizing that in the light of experience modification to the rules might be necessary, specifically held the proceeding open, so that as experience developed, they could take steps to modify the rules.","start":960.315,"stop":979.367,"duration":19.05},{"text":"Apart from the alleged absence of required findings, appellees contend the enforcement of rules wanted to impose undue hardship on shippers and railroads and like and will completely alter the traditional methods of moving traffic.","start":979.367,"stop":994.654,"duration":15.29},{"text":"To begin with, particularly this later charge brings a little bit hollow, since it is in fact, the railroad's own rules which are being enforced here.","start":994.654,"stop":1005.025,"duration":10.37},{"text":"But more to the point, enforcement of the rules will not, as is suggested, result in the abolishment of a national pool of freight cars.","start":1005.025,"stop":1014.736,"duration":9.71},{"text":"The rules do not prohibit the loading of foreign freight cars.","start":1014.736,"stop":1019.155,"duration":4.42},{"text":"They simply prescribe the circumstances under which it can be done.","start":1019.155,"stop":1024.527,"duration":5.37},{"text":"Railroads both large and small will continue to use a mixture of foreign and home cars to meet the needs of their shippers.","start":1024.527,"stop":1034.345,"duration":9.82},{"text":"With respect to the undue hardship argument, everyone recognizes that 100% compliance with the AAR rules will not be possible.","start":1034.345,"stop":1046.339,"duration":11.99},{"text":"Indeed a Commission witness testified that it was impossible to write any set of car service rules which could be complied with a 100% of the time.","start":1046.339,"stop":1063.126,"duration":16.79},{"text":"The Exception provisions adopted by the Commission, we submit, provide the necessary relief which will allow these rules to be workable.","start":1063.126,"stop":1071.88,"duration":8.75},{"text":"The first provision is contained in note B to Rules 1 and 2 and that's at page 34 of our brief.","start":1071.88,"stop":1080.088,"duration":8.21},{"text":"That provision permits the railroads involved to negotiate exceptions to the rules where inequities arise.","start":1080.088,"stop":1088.793,"duration":8.7},{"text":"Now these negotiations will be subject only to the concurrence of the car service division of the AAR, prior approval of the Commission will not be necessary.","start":1088.793,"stop":1098.705,"duration":9.91},{"text":"It is expected that the AAR would keep the Commission informed as to what sort of exceptions it was approving, but the initial responsibility would be on the railroads themselves to negotiate exceptions and then to obtain the approval of the AAR.","start":1098.705,"stop":1115.311,"duration":16.61},{"text":"There is no requirement that request to the AAR be in writing and none is sought to be imposed by the Commission.","start":1115.311,"stop":1125.454,"duration":10.14},{"text":"Nor will a separate exception be required with respect to each individual freight car that is proposed to be loaded not in compliance with the rules.","start":1125.454,"stop":1135.832,"duration":10.38},{"text":"Negotiated exceptions may in fact involve many freight cars and -- so that appellee's assertion that there will be a flood of request for exceptions, I think, they've predicted something like 40,000 a month, we submit is a very gross exaggeration indeed.","start":1135.832,"stop":1158.009,"duration":22.18},{"text":"Now where an agreement between the railroads cannot be obtained or where the AAR car service rules does not endorse such an agreement, then Rule 19 comes in to play.","start":1158.009,"stop":1170.192,"duration":12.18},{"text":"Now rule 19 which was adopted by the Commission on reconsideration grants very broad -- is a very broad grant of authority.","start":1170.192,"stop":1182.524,"duration":12.33},{"text":"I would just like to read a quote from that rule.","start":1182.524,"stop":1186.342,"duration":3.82},{"text":"Under that rule, the bureau of operations is given the authority to grant exceptions “for the purpose of further improving car supply

hardships.","start":1186.342,"stop":1205.721,"duration":19.38},{"text":"The Commission's order promulgating Rule 19 goes even further and specifically authorizes the Bureau of Operations to modify the
