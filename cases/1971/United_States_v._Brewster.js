Court.","start":32.341,"stop":38.335,"duration":5.99},{"text":"This is a direct appeal from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia which has held that an act of Congress, generally applicable throughout the United States is unconstitutional as applied to the offense charged in the criminal indictment before it.","start":38.335,"stop":65.364,"duration":27.03},{"text":"The offense, to put it simply, is bribery and the defendant against whom the charge is made was a United States Senator at the time charged is now a former United States Senator.","start":65.364,"stop":85.342,"duration":19.98},{"text":"The facts are simple.","start":85.342,"stop":90.061,"duration":4.72},{"text":"There is virtually nothing before the Court except the indictment, found by the grand jury and a motion to dismiss the indictment which was granted.","start":90.061,"stop":105.023,"duration":14.96},{"text":"The indictment contains a number of counts.","start":105.023,"stop":108.982,"duration":3.96},{"text":"The odd numbered counts relate to the defendant, the alleged bribee.","start":108.982,"stop":117.638,"duration":8.66},{"text":"The even number counts relate to the parties who are charged with having offered or given the bribe, or the briber.","start":117.638,"stop":128.255,"duration":10.62},{"text":"And the underlying facts appear on page 1 of the appendix in the -- as alleged in the indictment, that at all times, Daniel Brewster was a public official of the United States, a member of the Senate of the United States from the State of Maryland.","start":128.255,"stop":150.199,"duration":21.94},{"text":"And then the gist of the charge appears on page 2 of the appendix with respect to count 1 and I repeat, the odd numbered count relates to Senator Brewster and are all essentially the same as far as the issue now before the Court is concerned and the charge is that he corruptly asked, solicited, sought, accepted, received and agreed to receive the sum of $5,000.00 for himself and for an entity, that is the DC Committee from Maryland Education, from Cyrus T Anderson and Spiegel Inc. in return for being influenced in his performance of official acts in respect of his action, vote and decision on postage rate legislation which might at any time be pending before him in his official capacity.","start":150.199,"stop":210.062,"duration":59.86},{"text":"Now, the motion which was filed on behalf of the defendant appears on page 8 of the appendix.","start":210.062,"stop":219.914,"duration":9.85},{"text":"There is also another motion on page 9 which relates to vagueness and things to that sort which was not dealt with in any way by the District Court and an appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act brings to this Court only the issue which was dealt with, excuse me, this is not the Criminal Appeals Act, this is the Act allowing direct appeals in cases where an act to Congress has been held unconstitutional and such an appeal brings here only the issue which was decided below.","start":219.914,"stop":253.88,"duration":33.97},{"text":"And the motion to dismiss on page 8 of the appendix, the defendant moves to dismiss the odd numbered counts and ground is that counts 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the indictment charged this defendant with violations of 18 U.S.C. 201 (c) (1) and in each such count this defendant is charged with being influenced in his performance of official acts in his capacity as a United States Senator.","start":253.88,"stop":283.996,"duration":30.12},{"text":"And there is of course not the slightest doubt that that is what the indictment charge is, that he was influenced in his official acts, in his capacity as a United States Senator.","start":283.996,"stop":295.974,"duration":11.98},{"text":"Now, the question of jurisdiction of this Court was postponed until the hearing on the merits and here I find I have made a mistake.","start":295.974,"stop":314.127,"duration":18.15},{"text":"This is an appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act.","start":314.127,"stop":318.713,"duration":4.59},{"text":"It might possibly have been brought under the other statutes, but it is an appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act.","start":318.713,"stop":325.336,"duration":6.62},{"text":"The statute involved is the former form of Section 3731 of Title XVIII and known as the Criminal Appeals Act.","start":325.336,"stop":336.408,"duration":11.07},{"text":"The amendment to this provision which was enacted last January is not applicable since the case was began by indictment on December 1, 1969, more than a year before the enactment of the amendment.","start":336.408,"stop":351.986,"duration":15.58},{"text":"The relevant provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act are quoted on page 5 of the appellee’s motion to dismiss or affirm and on page 9 of the appellee’s brief and to refresh the Court’s recollection, I will read the two provisions involved which are at least verbally, relevantly, relatively simple.","start":351.986,"stop":380.74,"duration":28.75},{"text":"Appeal lies to this Court under that statute from a decision or judgment setting aside or dismissing any indictment or information on any count thereof where such decision or judgment is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or information is founded.","start":380.74,"stop":403.315,"duration":22.57},{"text":"And the other statute relating to appeals on acts that -- decisions holding act of Congress unconstitutional is not applicable because it applies only to civil cases.","start":403.315,"stop":414.263,"duration":10.95},{"text":"And this is a criminal case and the second head of jurisdiction under the old Criminal Appeals Act is from the decision or judgment sustaining a motion in bar when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.","start":414.263,"stop":431.167,"duration":16.9},{"text":"And we contend that there is jurisdiction under this case under either or both of those two provisions of the former Criminal Appeals Act.","start":431.167,"stop":442.176,"duration":11.01},{"text":"In the first place, it is entirely clear that the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.","start":442.176,"stop":448.101,"duration":5.93},{"text":"No jury was empaneled nor was the case in any way submitted to the judge as a trier of the facts with the judge sitting in place of a jury.","start":448.101,"stop":460.788,"duration":12.69},{"text":"There was simply the indictment and the motion to dismiss, the traditional way to raise a legal question with respect to a criminal indictment and thus the case comes within the language of Justice Harlan in the Sisson case, where in distinguishing this Court’s decision in United States against Covington.","start":460.788,"stop":485.707,"duration":24.92},{"text":"Justice Harlan noted that the dismissal in Covington was “before trial without any evidentiary hearing” and that is printed in the italics in the report itself.","start":485.707,"stop":500.238,"duration":14.53},{"text":"That of course is exactly the situation here.","start":500.238,"stop":502.675,"duration":2.44},{"text":"This was before trial and without any evidentiary hearing.","start":502.675,"stop":507.891,"duration":5.22},{"text":"And similarly the situation comes clearly within the language used in the Court’s opinion in the Jorn case last term where it was said that in enacting the Criminal Appeals Act, Congress wished “to avoid subjecting the defendant to a second trial, where the first had terminated in a manner favorable to the defendant either because of a jury verdict or because of judicial action.”","start":507.891,"stop":537.13,"duration":29.24},{"text":"Here there has never been a first trial.","start":537.13,"stop":540.539,"duration":3.41},{"text":"There has been a motion to dismiss entirely on the face of the pleadings.","start":540.539,"stop":545.488,"duration":4.95},{"text":"There has been a decision on that motion to dismiss, but that is not in the sense of the Criminal Appeals Act or the sense of double jeopardy, a trial.","start":545.488,"stop":555.631,"duration":10.14},{"text":"In this case there was no stipulation of facts of any sort.","start":555.631,"stop":560.767,"duration":5.14},{"text":"There was nothing that could even be regarded as a Bill of Particulars or anything like that.","start":560.767,"stop":567.283,"duration":6.52},{"text":"There were no concessions by the Government of any sort, nor any factual assertions by the Government beyond what is stated in the indictment.","start":567.283,"stop":578.919,"duration":11.64},{"text":"The entire proceedings before Judge Hart are printed in the appendix.","start":578.919,"stop":584.962,"duration":6.04},{"text":"I believe that what I have said with respect to them is fully supported by the record.","start":584.962,"stop":593.269,"duration":8.31},{"text":"There is nothing in it to support a contention that Judge Hart made any sort of a factual determination or adjudication.","start":593.269,"stop":604.037,"duration":10.77},{"text":"What he decided is that on the facts alleged in the indictment, the statute cannot be constitutionally applied.","start":604.037,"stop":612.762,"duration":8.72},{"text":"And Mr. Ramsey quite properly points to language which was used by Judge Hart in expressing his opinion and this appears on page 33 of the appendix.","start":612.762,"stop":627.372,"duration":14.61},{"text":"And Judge Hart did say right at the middle of the page, gentlemen, “based on the facts of this case, which sounds bad from my point of view, it is admitted by the Government, which sounds bad from my point of view, that the five counts of the indictment which charged Senator Brewster relate to the acceptance of bribes in connection with performance of a legislative function by a Senator of the United States.”","start":627.372,"stop":657.582,"duration":30.21},{"text":"But from an examination of the transcript, it is readily apparent that the facts to which Judge Hart was referring were those stated in the indictment not anything that was conceded by the Government or asserted by the Government or offered by way of affidavit, deposition in any other way in terms of facts, above and beyond the effects alleged in the indictment.","start":657.582,"stop":685.009,"duration":27.43},{"text":"And it is also clear that nothing was admitted in a factual sense by counsel, by -- for the Government, before Judge Hart.","start":685.009,"stop":694.586,"duration":9.58},{"text":"Insofar as counsel admitted anything there, it was that the facts charged in the indictment are those which are -- they are alleged, namely that the defendant was at all relevant times a United States Senator and that he is charged with seeking and receiving a bribe under the circumstances stated in the indictment.","start":694.586,"stop":723.594,"duration":29.01},{"text":"Thus there is clearly a case in which the Court below has held that an act of Congress is unconstitutional as applied to the facts alleged in this indictment.","start":723.594,"stop":736.987,"duration":13.39},{"text":"This seems to come squarely within this Court’s decision in the Knox case in 396 U.S.which upheld the jurisdiction of this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act, where the statute has been held unconstitutional as applied to the facts alleged in the indictment, although not generally unconstitutional.","start":736.987,"stop":762.633,"duration":25.65},{"text":"It is also our view that there is jurisdiction under the other clause of Section 3731, the one relating to a motion in bar.","start":762.633,"stop":775.106,"duration":12.47},{"text":"We contend that the assertion made in the motion to dismiss in this case, namely that, this defendant is charged with being influenced in his performance of official acts in his capacity as a United Sated Senator and that the indictment for this reason violates the provision of Article 1, Section 6 of the United States constitution is a motion in bar.","start":775.106,"stop":802.467,"duration":27.36},{"text":"Sometimes a motion in bar is referred to as a confession in avoidance and Mr. Ramsey says that the defendant has not confessed.","start":802.467,"stop":814.17,"duration":11.7},{"text":"I think though that the problem comes from too broader use of the word confession.","start":814.17,"stop":820.785,"duration":6.62},{"text":"When a person raises the statute on limitations or a pardon, this is clearly within the motion in bar provision, yet in such a case the defendant need not to confess.","start":820.785,"stop":836.027,"duration":15.24},{"text":"He says in the effect, whether I did it or not or even if I did do it, you cannot prosecute me because of the statute of limitations or the pardon as the case may be.","start":836.027,"stop":851.297,"duration":15.27},{"text":"And this is exactly what Senator Brewster’s counsel have said here, whether I did it or not or even if I did do it, you cannot prosecute me because of the speech or debate clause.","start":851.297,"stop":866.605,"duration":15.31},{"text":"This seems to me to be what is meant by motion in bar as used in this statute or by the term special plea in bar, which was used in its original form.","start":866.605,"stop":883.059,"duration":16.45},{"text":"It is for example the kind of motion that would have been made by a member of the House of Commons in the 18th century.","start":883.059,"stop":891.074,"duration":8.01},{"text":"If there were a charge against him which he cannot allege, he came within parliamentary privilege.","start":891.074,"stop":898.945,"duration":7.87},{"text":"What the defendant is saying is that even if I admitted all of the facts, I have a special defense that I suggest is a motion in bar and brings this case within the jurisdictional statute.","start":898.945,"stop":916.853,"duration":17.91},{"text":"Now, let me turn to the merits of the case which is of course a natural sequel to the Court’s decision in the Johnson case in 383 U.S. decided little over five years ago.","start":916.853,"stop":935.064,"duration":18.21},{"text":"Understandably enough, the appellee relies on the Johnson decision and it is incumbent on me to show that the facts there make that case distinguishable from those which are alleged in this indictment and I repeat we have nothing here except the facts alleged in the indictment.","start":935.064,"stop":958.999,"duration":23.94},{"text":"It is perfectly possible, it seems to me for this trial to be conducted under this indictment in a way which might infringe the Johnson case and if that were done, there would be another issue, but that is not the problem here.","start":958.999,"stop":973.747,"duration":14.75},{"text":"The problem here is whether the trial can be conducted in such a way as not to infringe the Johnson case and I submit that it can.","start":973.747,"stop":983.283,"duration":9.54}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"The

view.","start":991.771,"stop":1014.274,"duration":22.5},{"text":"In the first, the charge there, the issue there related to a charge under the conspiracy statute which is I suppose the most general of all criminal statutes, the one most subject to undue extension by a wide ranging prosecutor.","start":1014.274,"stop":1035.439,"duration":21.17},{"text":"In the second place, the prosecution of Congressman Johnson largely turned on a speech which he made on the floor of Congress, that is the prosecution with respect to this, there was also another count of a conflict of interest which related to his appearances in the Department of Justice, but the conspiracy charge related to a speech he had made in the floor of Congress relating to building and loan associations.","start":1035.439,"stop":1060.334,"duration":24.89},{"text":"Although the record was a long one and had many things in it, 50 pages of the transcript related to the speech in the case presented by the Government and there was much more about the speech in the presentation of the defense.","start":1060.334,"stop":1077.75,"duration":17.42},{"text":"The Government indeed introduced a copy of the speech in evidence.","start":1077.75,"stop":1082.735,"duration":4.98},{"text":"The conspiracy charge was that the speech was not made for any legislative purpose, but was made by Congressman Johnson for fee in order to that might reprinted and distributed to prospective depositors so as to encourage them to make deposits in Maryland’s Savings and Loan associations.","start":1082.735,"stop":1104.932,"duration":22.2},{"text":"It is also relevant I think that the indictment contained a substantial allegation about the speech and this was reproduced in this Court’s opinion at page 184, at paragraph 15, I read from the opinion.","start":1104.932,"stop":1124.036,"duration":19.1},{"text":"It was a part of said conspiracy that it said, Thomas F.
