atrocious sort.","start":54.24,"stop":69.093,"duration":14.85},{"text":"In the second case, the Furman case, we have a killing in the course of the burglary murder which may or may not have been

rape.","start":69.093,"stop":89.549,"duration":20.46},{"text":"The briefs of the parties and of the amici canvas a broad range of considerations under the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments.","start":89.549,"stop":98.939,"duration":9.39},{"text":"But I think there are mergers from the briefs, the clear impression that the central issue in this case, the real nerve of this controversy, is the scope and indeed the propriety of judicial review of legislatives, State legislative determinations to use the penalty of death.","start":98.939,"stop":126.533,"duration":27.59},{"text":"The briefs on behalf of the respondents primarily support the death penalty on the ground that it exists on the statute books of 41 States and of the Federal Government.","start":126.533,"stop":141.607,"duration":15.07},{"text":"And that it has been put there by the legislatures of 41 States in the Federal Government and that

judgment is entitled to respect.","start":153.643,"stop":158.766,"duration":5.12},{"text":"I agree with all of that, but for me I think that is the beginning and not the end of analysis under the Eight Amendment because judicial review of legislative judgment is just as inevitable as it is difficult.","start":158.766,"stop":177.519,"duration":18.75},{"text":"Under a constitution which commits to the courts, protection of the individual under guarantee such as Cruel and Unusual punishment or Due Process or Equal Protection of the laws, precisely because these guarantees are fundamental statements of the most basic principles of our society.","start":177.519,"stop":200.383,"duration":22.86},{"text":"The least conferring to the narrow historical circumstances that gave them birth.","start":200.383,"stop":205.811,"duration":5.43},{"text":"They are cast in general terms their generality makes them difficult to interpret and it also creates the risk which Mr. Justice

government to deal with individuals.","start":222.077,"stop":244.568,"duration":22.49},{"text":"Guarantee such as cruel and unusual punishment and Due Process and Equal Protection are broad statements in grand form, cash for an unforeseeable future and intended to be construed to give continuing protection to limitations upon governmental power.","start":244.568,"stop":271.048,"duration":26.48},{"text":"Such protections to the individual are not likely often to be added to the constitution by the amending process because when they most needed they are least likely to commend the political approval necessary to add so they are put in general form and they are committed the courts to construe as times change during the life of the nation and visit by the constitution.","start":271.048,"stop":295.419,"duration":24.37},{"text":"I conclude from that that although difference and circumspection the legislative judgment is vital.","start":295.419,"stop":305.572,"duration":10.15},{"text":"That abnegation of judicial, the legislative judgment is impermissible because the very existence of a clause like the Eight Amendment

legislative.","start":335.732,"stop":341.698,"duration":5.97},{"text":"It can only have meant to limit legislative means and this court has in fact pretty times appied it to invalidate legislation and

to determine?","start":365.338,"stop":370.025,"duration":4.69},{"text":"The problem of standards is critical because of the generality of cruel and unusual punishment that I described.","start":370.025,"stop":379.489,"duration":9.46},{"text":"The language is not crystalline it is not clear you cannot look at the punishment and see whether the cruel you cannot look at it

projection into the future as I described.","start":386.406,"stop":401.452,"duration":15.05},{"text":"The state of California, State of Georgia and Texas to some extent in their briefs have all made the point that at the time of the Eight Amendment was written, Capital punishment was widely used.","start":401.452,"stop":414.864,"duration":13.41},{"text":"The Fifth Amendment clearly envisages that there will be capital cases.","start":414.864,"stop":419.285,"duration":4.42},{"text":"The Federal Congress put capital statutes on the books.","start":419.285,"stop":424.894,"duration":5.61},{"text":"All of these misconceived I think our submission to the court which is not that when the Eight Amendment was ratified in 1791 it was intended then and there to do with capital punishment, anymore than it was intended then and there to do away with whippings or brandings or cutting off the beers or anymore than Equal Protection
