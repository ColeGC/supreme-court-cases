physically present in that district.","start":269.15,"stop":281.533,"duration":12.38},{"text":"The second question is whether habeas corpus is the only remedy available to a serviceman, seeking to obtain judicial review of a denial of the request for discharge.","start":281.533,"stop":292.789,"duration":11.26},{"text":"That question of course includes several aspects but that is the primary second issue.","start":292.789,"stop":300.193,"duration":7.4},{"text":"Now with respect the habeas corpus issue, this Court in this context is called upon to balance the greatness of the writ of habeas corpus which relies on its prompt availability against the territorial restriction which Congress has placed on the District Court's to grant writs of habeas corpus.","start":300.193,"stop":319.565,"duration":19.37},{"text":"The restriction that is included in the statute in the following

jurisdictions.","start":322.832,"stop":329.266,"duration":6.43},{"text":"As the Government's contention here that that phrase means that both the petitioner and the custodian must be physically present in the district in order for the court to grant the writ, whereas petitioner contends that as long as he is physically present in the district, it is only necessarily that the custodian be present jurisdictionally through context that he has had with the petitioner in the district and it is not necessary at least in this context and the limited context that arises that the custodian be physically present.","start":329.266,"stop":364.698,"duration":35.43},{"text":"Now to support this contention, we looked first to the history of the habeas corpus statute in this particular phrase which was inserted into the statute and has remained unchanged in 1867.","start":364.698,"stop":377.91,"duration":13.21},{"text":"The purpose of that insertion into the statute at that time was to avoid the situation where petitioners in habeas corpus proceedings might have to be transported about around the country.","start":377.91,"stop":391.585,"duration":13.67},{"text":"Ironically, the government's contention here was that the petitioner must do that very thing.","start":391.585,"stop":396.325,"duration":4.74},{"text":"He must travel long distances across this country before he can invoke the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the District Court.","start":396.325,"stop":405.563,"duration":9.24},{"text":"The problem that we have in this case with respect to this particular phrase though arises because there are new class of habeas corpus petitioners in this country now as the result of the series of decisions of this Court which has expanded the availability of the writ of habeas corpus to include persons who are not an actual physical complainant or not actually held behind bars.","start":405.563,"stop":428.031,"duration":22.47},{"text":"And this class of petitioners may indeed be in one district and the custodian be in another situation that was previously highly unlikely to ever arise.","start":428.031,"stop":438.333,"duration":10.3},{"text":"Now, this Court has interpreted this phrase in the past in the case of Ahrens against Clark and has there concluded that a petitioner must indeed be physically present in the district for the District Court to have jurisdiction and it has not change this ruling apparently in view of the new class of petitioners that exist.","start":438.333,"stop":456.484,"duration":18.15},{"text":"But of course that requirement is met here.","start":456.484,"stop":460.779,"duration":4.3},{"text":"But there is no question that if the custodian must also be physically present in the district that this will greatly restrict the availability of the writ of habeas corpus certainly to the particular facts of petitioners that we have before the Court today, and it is our contention that this is contrary to the purpose behind the phrase in the statute.","start":460.779,"stop":484.408,"duration":23.63},{"text":"It's contrary to the purposes of the great writ that it be properly available.","start":484.408,"stop":491.305,"duration":6.9},{"text":"It advances no policy interest of the Government.","start":491.305,"stop":494.272,"duration":2.97},{"text":"The Government benefits

Hansen","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you.","start":2793.039,"stop":2793.313,"duration":0.27},{"text":"I would like to require the several things that the Solicitor General raised.","start":2793.313,"stop":2797.744,"duration":4.43},{"text":"First, with respect to the custodian, bringing the body before the court, I find this to be a very strange requirement to be elevated in this case to preclude the District Court from jurisdiction where the petitioner is already in the jurisdiction of the District Court, and the custodian here has put in years been ordering him around and producing his body by orders communicated to him by mail in this very same district.","start":2797.744,"stop":2825.188,"duration":27.44},{"text":"And, I do not see how it would help the government to have the custodian now physically present in the district.","start":2825.188,"stop":2832.903,"duration":7.71},{"text":"Moreover, under one of their suggestions that he go to Indiana for a scintilla of time, establish jurisdiction there and then apparently, go back home to San Francisco with have the same problem.","start":2832.903,"stop":2843.728,"duration":10.83},{"text":"This Court has long recognized that it is not necessary with the custodian be physically able to produce the body because he is in the district.","start":2843.728,"stop":2853.104,"duration":9.38},{"text":"I think the Endo case says that when the petitioner has left the district and he is in the custody, actual physical custody of some other person, a custodian can still by long distance produce the result desired, and that is what we urge here.","start":2853.104,"stop":2866.456,"duration":13.35},{"text":"I regret that the Solicitor General has raised the question forum shopping in this case for the first time at this level.","start":2866.456,"stop":2872.809,"duration":6.35},{"text":"It has never been raised before.","start":2872.809,"stop":2874.248,"duration":1.44},{"text":"There is never been a hint of it in this case.","start":2874.248,"stop":2877.042,"duration":2.79},{"text":"And the government has never suggested that this case would be more, better brought in another district for any reason relating to forum shopping.","start":2877.042,"stop":2884.97,"duration":7.93},{"text":"Second Circuit in the Arlen case rather summarily dispose of that suggestion and found it somewhat frivolous that the government had any interest in having these cases tried in the district other than that where the petitioner is residing.","start":2884.97,"stop":2899.086,"duration":14.12},{"text":"There just was not forum shopping here, and if forum shopping arises in these cases in the future, they can be controlled by venue and forum non conveniens rulings not by artificial jurisdictional rulings.","start":2899.086,"stop":2912.146,"duration":13.06},{"text":"Likewise, the suggestion as Lieutenant Strait enjoyed some kind of draft exemption because having accepted in ROTC Commission was raised and then rejected by the Court of Appeals.","start":2912.146,"stop":2923.427,"duration":11.28},{"text":"Had Lieutenant Strait not gone through ROTC, not accepted this commission, he would have been exempt from the draft just the same under with the two (Inaudible) through college and the hospital that he would have been entitled too.","start":2923.427,"stop":2935.111,"duration":11.68},{"text":"As to the APA on its base eliminating jurisdiction where there is another remedy.","start":2935.111,"stop":2943.182,"duration":8.07},{"text":"The Solicitor General did not mention in this Court's decision of Brownell against We Shung in 1948 where the Court permitted an immigrant to use the APA and declaratory relief, even though he could have submitted himself to custody and brought habeas corpus, and he held that either remedy was available.","start":2943.182,"stop":2961.786,"duration":18.6},{"text":"I also find some inconsistency in the suggestion that the APA is not a jurisdictional statute, and yet also arguing that if jurisdiction independently exists, the Court should not exercise the APA jurisdiction.","start":2961.786,"stop":2975.006,"duration":13.22},{"text":"If APA jurisdiction is not an independent jurisdictional ground, then there would always be another remedy, and never any need to use APA.","start":2975.006,"stop":2985.311,"duration":10.31},{"text":"I don't see any problem either of the Court having to reach the kinds of issues suggested by the Solicitor General with respect to serviceman wanting to challenge their duty assignments or type of training they are getting.","start":2985.311,"stop":2997.396,"duration":12.09},{"text":"Those are indeed policy decisions of the army that do not necessarily relate to facts that have been found in administrative proceedings that have been held in order to maybe indeed in those areas of complete discretion, and this Court has long held that the courts will not control assignments of servicemen to specific duty assignments, but that was repeatedly affirmed to right of man claiming that he is illegally held in the army to challenge the army's right to continue to hold him.","start":2997.396,"stop":3026.194,"duration":28.8},{"text":"That is what is asked here, now the Court in mandamus could issue an order in combination with the declaratory judgment action.","start":3026.194,"stop":3033.711,"duration":7.52},{"text":"My time is up and thank you gentlemen very much and I urge you to rule for our
