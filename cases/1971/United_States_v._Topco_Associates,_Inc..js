Safeway which may operate in about 30.","start":558.525,"stop":571.098,"duration":12.57},{"text":"There is no question as to the purpose of the restrictions, the purpose of the territorialization and the wholesale restrictions, which supplement them, are to protect the members from each others competition in the sale of Topco branded products, that is why you have an exclusive arrangement like this.","start":571.098,"stop":587.583,"duration":16.49},{"text":"And, it was the government’s position in the District Court, it is the government’s position here that this kind of arrangement affected through this of its kind of an organization is a horizontal agreement to allocate territories and to restrict wholesale operations, which is illegal per se and has been illegal per se, ever since the Addyston Pipe case, 70 years ago.","start":587.583,"stop":615.549,"duration":27.97},{"text":"If this was a vertical restriction, arguably it might be a different case, although even there, I think the law is now clear that a vertical restriction on products which are sold to a business for resale and are owned by it cannot be imposed even vertically.","start":615.549,"stop":635.742,"duration":20.19},{"text":"And a fortiori, when you have it horizontal as you do this case, by there is an agreement among direct and actual and potential competitors, it has to be illegal per se.","start":635.742,"stop":648.454,"duration":12.71},{"text":"The District Court relied particularly in its decision on the Sixth Circuit’s ruling in Federal Trade Commission against Sandura Company in 339 F. 2d 847, yet that was a vertical case and in that case, the Sixth Circuit pointed out that if the arrangement before it had been a horizontal arrangement as this is, then it would have been illegal per se.","start":648.454,"stop":676.366,"duration":27.91},{"text":"Now, I call it horizontal because this organization is almost identical in its operation to the operation in United States against Sealy.","start":676.366,"stop":688.709,"duration":12.34},{"text":"When you put the Sealy case together with the ruling in United States against Schwinn Company, which also involved a territorial restriction, you come up with a plain rule that it is illegal per se.","start":688.709,"stop":701.846,"duration":13.14},{"text":"We think the District Court should have stopped right there.","start":701.846,"stop":707.478,"duration":5.63},{"text":"It did not.","start":707.478,"stop":708.131,"duration":0.65},{"text":"It went on to say that this kind of territorialization is reasonable, even though is among actual and potential competitors because without competition from each other, each member would better be able to control the pricing and merchandising of Topco goods and thus, would better be able to compete with the vertically integrated chains, such A&P, Kroger and Safeway.","start":708.131,"stop":735.489,"duration":27.36},{"text":"The argument was that these organizations, A&P, Safeway and Kroger are able through vertical integration to have exclusive private brand, that is private brands that they do not sell to anybody else.","start":735.489,"stop":747.255,"duration":11.77},{"text":"So, what the Topco organization was permitted to do by the District Court was to agree among themselves not to compete, so that they could have exclusive private brands and the only way they could achieve that exclusivity, however, was by horizontal agreement among themselves.","start":747.255,"stop":762.728,"duration":15.47},{"text":"That is the justification, which is said to take this case outside the per se rule.","start":762.728,"stop":769.219,"duration":6.49},{"text":"Our objection is not to exclusivity as such with respect to a brand nor is it to the combination of chains into a single buying organization to achieve useful economies of scale.","start":769.219,"stop":783.908,"duration":14.69},{"text":"What we object to is the attempt to achieve exclusivity by an agreement not to compete among their actual and potential competitors.","start":783.908,"stop":795.658,"duration":11.75},{"text":"Now, when the District Court sought to justify this arrangement, it said that the government had conceded that the Topco arrangements enabled Topco members to compete better.","start":795.658,"stop":808.479,"duration":12.82},{"text":"We did not make such a concession.","start":808.479,"stop":810.7,"duration":2.22},{"text":"In our post-trial brief we said, while it may be true as the defendant contends that these unlawful agreements are intended to enable the member chains to more effectively compete with others in the marketplace, this motive does not immunize defendant’s conduct.","start":810.7,"stop":828.492,"duration":17.79},{"text":"Instead, what we urged in the District Court was that, the law just does not allow direct agreement among competitors as a means of counterbalancing the power or advantages of somebody else in the marketplace.","start":828.492,"stop":843.026,"duration":14.53},{"text":"The same argument was made in the Schwinn case, where it was said, let us have territorialization, so that our dealers in trademark bicycles can better compete with the mass merchandisers.","start":843.026,"stop":855.232,"duration":12.21}]},{"speakerName":"William J.
