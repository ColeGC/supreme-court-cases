time.","start":69.2,"stop":76.726,"duration":7.53},{"text":"And, that is whether the present version of the regulation of the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, 45 CFR, 233-100A1 is valid under the grant of rule making authority containing Section 407A of the Social Security Act.","start":76.726,"stop":93.635,"duration":16.91},{"text":"So, what we are arguing today is an Administrative

407A.","start":114.777,"stop":123.584,"duration":8.81},{"text":"Before stating the facts, it might be helpful to briefly outline the statutory framework.","start":123.584,"stop":129.469,"duration":5.88},{"text":"The AFDC-UF Program, unlike the regular AFDC Program, authorizes benefits to two parent households, where the need or deprivation of the children in the family arise from the unemployment of the father.","start":129.469,"stop":143.246,"duration":13.78},{"text":"Program was first enacted in 1961 as the Unemployed Parent Program and covered need or deprivation arising from the unemployment of either parent.","start":143.246,"stop":151.848,"duration":8.6},{"text":"In its original form Section 407, provided for coverage of children, who are needy as a result of the unemployment of a parent “As define by the State.”","start":151.848,"stop":163.851,"duration":12},{"text":"In 1968, substantial amendments were made in program and the language of Section 407 was changed from unemployment as defined by the State to “Unemployment” as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary.","start":163.851,"stop":180.709,"duration":16.86},{"text":"After passage of these amendments, HEW prescribed the predecessor version of 233-100A1, which mandated an hours work criterion for State definitions of unemployment.","start":180.709,"stop":193.586,"duration":12.88},{"text":"All persons who work less than 30 hours per week.","start":193.586,"stop":197.797,"duration":4.21},{"text":"The regulation also permitted coverage per persons who work up to 35 hours per

1971.","start":203.748,"stop":210.762,"duration":7.01},{"text":"The claimants in this case, all applied for Maryland AFDC-UF benefits, after applying for and being denied, Maryland unemployment compensation benefits.","start":210.762,"stop":220.682,"duration":9.92},{"text":"Claimant Robert Francis, a laboratory technician, was denied unemployment insurance because he was participating in a

unemployment conversion, when it was determined that he had voluntarily left his job as a truck driver delivery man without a good cause.","start":247.959,"stop":265.643,"duration":17.68},{"text":"All these claimants were then denied AFDC-UF benefits in Maryland pursuing to Maryland’s Social Service Regulation, 702091082, which provides that a grant may not be paid for AFDCE which it is Maryland label for AFDC-UF “To meet need due to being disqualified for unemployment insurance.”","start":265.643,"stop":289.006,"duration":23.36},{"text":"The Three Judges District Court which was convened in the Francis case determined in its first decision which we described in our brief as Francis I, that this Maryland regulation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, as claimants had alleged, but that it did violate the predecessor version of 233-100A1.","start":289.006,"stop":305.678,"duration":16.67},{"text":"In a courts’ view, that regulation did not permits States to consider any factors other than hours worked in determining unemployment.","start":305.678,"stop":315.072,"duration":9.39},{"text":"As a result, the District Courts subsequently enjoined enforcement of the Maryland Regulation.","start":315.072,"stop":321.19,"duration":6.12},{"text":"When that injunction was appealed by the State to this court, the Solicitor General advised the Court, that HEW had always interpreted the statue and its own regulation to permit other State eligibility factors such as contained in the Maryland Rule.","start":321.19,"stop":334.801,"duration":13.61},{"text":"However, since HEW had decided to amend its regulation to expressly permit regulations such as that of Maryland, the Solicitor General recommended Summary Affirmance, and this Court took that action.","start":334.801,"stop":347.86,"duration":13.06},{"text":"Thereafter HEW did amend the regulation as the Solicitor General had indicated and the regulation now requires that States pay benefits to those persons who work less than 100 hours per month except that States are permitted to deny benefits to persons engaged in a labor dispute or engaged in conduct resulting or which would result in disqualification under the States Unemployment Compensation Laws.","start":347.86,"stop":372.142,"duration":24.28},{"text":"After that Regulation was amended in that manner; Maryland filed a motion to resolve injunction in Francis I, but the District Court in Francis II decision held that the Maryland Regulation was still invalid on the ground that the amended HEW Regulation now violated Section 407A.","start":372.142,"stop":393.415,"duration":21.27},{"text":"The decision in Francis II not to vacate the previously entered injunction was based on a theory that Section 407, relates to unemployment of a father.","start":393.415,"stop":403.537,"duration":10.12},{"text":"And a father, who was discharge of the cause is unemployed, and HEW by regulation cannot permit States to deny benefits to person who would fall within this ordinary meaning of the term.","start":403.537,"stop":416.057,"duration":12.52},{"text":"With regard to persons out of work as a result of a labor dispute, the District Court held the amended regulations do not establish any standards for the States.","start":416.057,"stop":424.179,"duration":8.12},{"text":"It did not prescribe standards as the statute provided, since it granted discretion to the States to deny such or to pay such benefits.","start":424.179,"stop":432.53,"duration":8.35},{"text":"The separate District Court decision in the Bethea case, adopted the same reasoning as the Francis II decision did with regard to misconducts.","start":432.53,"stop":440.034,"duration":7.5},{"text":"The Bethea case was the one which involved persons who had voluntarily quitted without a good cause.","start":440.034,"stop":444.426,"duration":4.39},{"text":"The Court there held as in Francis II, with regard to misconduct that such persons were in fact unemployed and under the statute, the Federal Agency had no authority to deny benefits to such persons.","start":444.426,"stop":456.75,"duration":12.32},{"text":"Court of Appeals affirmed those two District Court decisions in a Per curiam decision adopting the reasoning and conclusions and not offering any rationale of its own.","start":456.75,"stop":466.379,"duration":9.63},{"text":"As I indicated earlier, the State believes that the basic issue in this case, is of the scope of HEW’s ruling authority.","start":466.379,"stop":474.135,"duration":7.76},{"text":"We contend that the issue is not whether AFDC-UF benefit should be paid to misconducts, to strikers, or the persons who have voluntarily quit there jobs.","start":474.135,"stop":482.455,"duration":8.32},{"text":"Rather the question is, whether the statute gives HEW the authority to allow States to choose to pay such benefits.","start":482.455,"stop":493.175,"duration":10.72},{"text":"Our position stated very briefly, is that statute constitutes a very broad grant of legislative type of rule making authority, HEW and that the regulation constitutes a reasonable exercise of that authority.","start":493.175,"stop":507.95,"duration":14.77},{"text":"There obviously, can be no question that the language of the statute expressly grants about rule making authority.","start":507.95,"stop":513.909,"duration":5.96},{"text":"We believe that those statutory words fall within the label that the Professor Jaffe and Davis had devised namely, legislative type of rule making.","start":513.909,"stop":522.566,"duration":8.66},{"text":"Other commentators refer to them as prescriptive or substantive rules.","start":522.566,"stop":527.545,"duration":4.98},{"text":"And it is well established, that such rule making is to be given substantial difference by the Courts.","start":527.545,"stop":534.245,"duration":6.7},{"text":"As this Court stated in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one.","start":534.245,"stop":541.218,"duration":6.97},{"text":"The Court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.","start":541.218,"stop":546.487,"duration":5.27},{"text":"Thus, the HW Regulation, we contend is valid and should be upheld if it is reasonable under the statute even if the Court favors a different result.","start":546.487,"stop":556.704,"duration":10.22},{"text":"Claimants and the District Court avoided the issue of the broad scope of rule making authority containing Section 407 in two ways.","start":556.704,"stop":564.339,"duration":7.64},{"text":"First, as I indicated, they argued that the regulation was invalid because it excluded from the persons’ from programs, certain persons’ who fell within the ordinary meaning of that term.","start":564.339,"stop":575.254,"duration":10.91},{"text":"We would respectfully contend that that reasoning begs the question.","start":575.254,"stop":579.226,"duration":3.97},{"text":"The purpose of the statutory words was to give the rule making authority to HEW and for HEW to give content to the term unemployment.","start":579.226,"stop":589.388,"duration":10.16},{"text":"The term has never been self defining in the statute.","start":589.388,"stop":592.929,"duration":3.54},{"text":"It was not self defining in 1961 and it is not self defining after 1968.","start":592.929,"stop":598.979,"duration":6.05},{"text":"Reliance on a dictionary meaning cannot answer such a question as this court had so recognized in the Burns v. Alcala case which concerned the meaning of the term 'dependent child'.","start":598.979,"stop":610.783,"duration":11.8},{"text":"While the District Court and the claimants choose to rely on the dictionary meaning of the term 'unemployment', of course, they choose to ignore totally, the dictionary meaning of the words in accordance to standards prescribed by the Secretary.","start":610.783,"stop":623.17,"duration":12.39},{"text":"The District Court also avoided the question of the scope of rule making authority contained in 407 by holding with regard to persons’ who had participated in a labor dispute, that the Section mandated a uniform national definition of unemployment.","start":623.17,"stop":640.294,"duration":17.12},{"text":"Therefore, the District Court reasoned that the limited grant of discretion to the States with regard to such persons’ disqualified for participation in labor dispute was improper.","start":640.294,"stop":654.382,"duration":14.09},{"text":"I do want to mention at this point that Maryland agrees with the point raised by the Solicitor General in his memorandum, that the Court does have to get to the question of the validity of the regulation in connection with persons’ participating in a labor dispute because in Maryland, all the claimants and the Maryland rule only operates against persons’ who are disqualified for unemployment insurance.","start":654.382,"stop":676.098,"duration":21.72},{"text":"It so happened that the leading name, plaintiff was a person who was participating in a strike but he was denied benefits because under the Maryland rule, he was disqualified from unemployment insurance.","start":676.098,"stop":685.69,"duration":9.59}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

brief, claimants brief, the appendix and the decisions below and I will not try to repeat it.","start":751.716,"stop":762.073,"duration":10.36},{"text":"It is true that there are phrases in the committee reports that talked about a national definition of unemployment.","start":762.073,"stop":768.977,"duration":6.9},{"text":"On the other hand, it is also true that other reports talks about the statute as authorizing a national definition or in sometimes it is the same report that uses the phrase, a national definition.","start":768.977,"stop":780.89,"duration":11.91},{"text":"And it is also true that those reports at some points used the actual statutory words namely, as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by HEW.","start":780.89,"stop":790.215,"duration":9.33},{"text":"It would have been very easy for the Congress to mandate a national definition with regard to a uniform national definition.","start":790.215,"stop":800.255,"duration":10.04},{"text":"All they would have to in 1968, would have been to substitute the word 'Secretary' for the word 'State' in the statute.","start":800.255,"stop":806.875,"duration":6.62},{"text":"This fact was recognized by the District Court in its Francis I decision but and that decision points out Congress chose instead to use new words which did not mandatorily require the Secretary to require each state to adopt the same of the word, unemployment but instead merely authorize the Secretary to prescribe a national meaning if the Secretary so desires.","start":806.875,"stop":830.021,"duration":23.15},{"text":"The many statements as to the intent of the 1968 change must be considered in connection with the actual words used in the statute.","start":830.021,"stop":839.296,"duration":9.28},{"text":"This court has recognized, the most persuasive evidence for the purpose of a statute is the words by which the legislature chooses to give expression to its wishes.","start":839.296,"stop":848.105,"duration":8.81},{"text":"We think that when one considers the legislative history behind the 1968 amendments and looks at the words of the statute themselves, it is clear that Congress contemplated that the Secretary of HEW was free to allow the States limited discretion to vary the coverage in response to their different needs and policies.","start":848.105,"stop":871.711,"duration":23.61},{"text":"Thus, under the broad authority granted by the Section, the federally prescribed standards could take the form of a national definition but they could also grant the States some discretion in some specific areas as in fact the regulation has done.","start":871.711,"stop":887.386,"duration":15.67},{"text":"Assuming that to be the case, HEW's regulations still must meet the test of reasonableness under the statute or the courts must set it aside.","start":887.386,"stop":895.076,"duration":7.69},{"text":"We think, it is clear that 233-100A1 does meet that test in connection with the purposes of the AFDC-UF Program as set out a statute and the legislative history.","start":895.076,"stop":907.095,"duration":12.02},{"text":"When the program was first adopted, President Kennedy indicated that it was intended for unemployed workers and he gave the example of a person who had exhausted his unemployment compensation.","start":907.095,"stop":916.278,"duration":9.18},{"text":"We have quoted at length in our brief from the statements by Congressman Burns, one of the co-sponsors of the original legislation, which makes clear that Congress did not intend that the program provide benefits to persons who are voluntarily unemployed.","start":916.278,"stop":932.418,"duration":16.14},{"text":"And as originally adopted in 1961 and as amended in 1968, Congress made clear that the program was intended to provide assistance

program.","start":932.418,"stop":952.278,"duration":19.86},{"text":"Furthermore, as amended the program is very similar in operation on unemployment compensation and that it is an Income Maintenance Program, designed to assist those who are unemployed not as result of their own conduct.","start":952.278,"stop":964.08,"duration":11.8},{"text":"In light of the similarity of these purposes, namely the persons who are involuntarily unemployed, we think it is clearly not unreasonable to attempt by regulation or to permit by regulation, a State to harmonize the operation of these two Income Maintenance Programs.","start":964.08,"stop":982.209,"duration":18.13},{"text":"Namely, not to pay benefits under one scheme for conduct which results in a disqualification under the other.","start":982.209,"stop":988.62,"duration":6.41},{"text":"We note that the District Court in dismissing the claimants constitutional claim, recognized this harmonization purpose as a rational basis for the regulation.","start":988.62,"stop":1001.723,"duration":13.1},{"text":"The court upheld the argument that the rationalization of these two programs which are both part of the scheme of cooperative Federalism described by this court in the King case established by the Social Security Act was a proper rational basis although the District Court did not necessarily agree with that basis.","start":1001.723,"stop":1024.657,"duration":22.93},{"text":"It is certainly not unreasonable to grant States limited discretion contained in

discretion.","start":1031.185,"stop":1039.422,"duration":8.24},{"text":"Now, the basic purpose of the statute is to extend assistance to a group of needy persons and this is true of all the public assistance programs.","start":1039.422,"stop":1047.089,"duration":7.67},{"text":"By making partial Federal reimbursement available to those States which need certain substitute Federal

program.","start":1060.83,"stop":1068.688,"duration":7.86},{"text":"As shown by the Solicitor General’s memorandum, a significant number of States, nine, if you count and include Maryland, have

might be interested in this type of a restriction would be greater than nine.","start":1068.688,"stop":1092.068,"duration":23.38},{"text":"It is difficult for Maryland to see how the prohibition
