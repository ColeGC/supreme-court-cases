construction of a home for the aged in Brooklyn, specified the use of climate control units, manufactured by Slant/Fin Corporation.","start":135.099,"stop":152.013,"duration":16.91},{"text":"Under these specifications, Slant/Fin was to cut thread and install at the factory the internal piping on the units which carried a one-year warranty contingent upon factory fabrication of the internal piping.","start":152.013,"stop":174.178,"duration":22.16},{"text":"As a result of competitive bidding, Austin awarded a subcontract for the heating, ventilating and air conditioning work on the home

business agent went to Austin, the general contractor and informed him, his project superintendent, the union’s members would not install the Slant/Fin units because the piping inside the units was Steamfitter’s work and the business agent then went to Hudik and told him essentially the same thing, adding that the prefabrication of the internal piping in the units was in violation of Rule IX of the collective agreement.","start":221.113,"stop":267.276,"duration":46.16},{"text":"As a result, Hudik’s employees refused to install the Slant/Fin units, where upon Austin filed an unfair labor

violation of Section 8(b)4(B) because the Board found it, while the refusal of Hudik’s employees to install these units was based on a valid work preservation clause in the agreement with Hudik and was to the purpose of preservation work they had traditionally performed, Hudik was incapable of assigning this work to his employees, and therefore, the union in exerting strike pressure on Hudik, had coupled it's work preservation objective with an unlawful secondary objective of also trying to change Austin’s manner of doing business with Slant/Fin.","start":277.653,"stop":335.612,"duration":57.96},{"text":"Now, Board entered an appropriate remedial order and the Court of Appeals as I indicated denied enforcement of the Board’s order,
