in other words, the amount of premiums that it takes in less the amount of the claims that it has to pay out.","start":757.093,"stop":778.67,"duration":21.58},{"text":"Now, the statute imposes a tax on the company’s taxable investment income plus one half of the amount by which its total gain from operations, that is the second category, exceeds its taxable investment income.","start":778.67,"stop":795.41,"duration":16.74},{"text":"So essentially the whole statutory mechanics are designed to make these computations in order to determine what amounts have to be set aside from reserves and thereby excluded from tax.","start":795.41,"stop":808.308,"duration":12.9},{"text":"Now, the phase-one computations, which we set forth in formula form, I think the most graphic way to understand it is to look at Page 6 of our brief, which sets forth a series of equations.","start":808.308,"stop":825.459,"duration":17.15},{"text":"Although they seem rather onerous, they are really not when you sort of strip away some of the detail, because what you have essentially, you are trying to take the company’s total investment income and break it down between the amounts that are allocable to reserves and thereby are owned by the policyholders so to speak, and should be free of tax and the amount that the company earns for itself, which does not have to set aside and it does have to pay a tax on that.","start":825.459,"stop":852.083,"duration":26.62},{"text":"So essentially looking at Page 6, the Court will see essentially three formulas and then a variation of the third formula.","start":852.083,"stop":860.949,"duration":8.87},{"text":"But what essentially the statute prescribes is that the first thing that the company has to do is compute its earnings rate, and that simply is its investment income divided by its assets, and then it multiplies that earnings rate times its reserves and that yields its tax exclusion.","start":860.949,"stop":877.57,"duration":16.62},{"text":"And as you can see, that third formula essentially substitute for earnings rate its equivalent in the first formula, which is investment yield over assets, and so you have a formula that is investment yield divided by assets times reserves equals the tax exclusions.","start":877.57,"stop":896.944,"duration":19.37},{"text":"And to restate the formula, it is essentially you can see from the last where the equation was described that investment yield is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is reserves and the denominator of which is assets.","start":896.944,"stop":913.196,"duration":16.25},{"text":"There is one significant thing from this-phase one computational expressions, as we have set it out in the briefs, is that the amount of the exclusion -- that is, the amount of taxable investment income which is free of tax -- is based upon a proportionate relationship of total reserves to total assets.","start":913.196,"stop":930.871,"duration":17.67},{"text":"Now, the phase-two computation is a much more traditional netting computation, which the Court is doubtless familiar from other income-tax cases.","start":930.871,"stop":940.712,"duration":9.84},{"text":"That is, it essentially says take in your gross amount of premiums, and you subtract certain deductions.","start":940.712,"stop":947.757,"duration":7.04},{"text":"That statute is set out in 809 of the Code, and essentially the unique deduction that the life-insurance companies are entitled to is set out in Section 809(d)(2);
