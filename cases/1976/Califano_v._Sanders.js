Administration.","start":190.953,"stop":195.813,"duration":4.86},{"text":"The Appeals Council affirmed the Administrative Law Judge, told in its affirmance, told the respondent that he had 60 days

client.","start":236.23,"stop":239.692,"duration":3.46},{"text":"He then asked for a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, the ALJ decided that he had not presented anything warranting a reopening of his claim, which was based upon the same disability benefits period as the earlier round had been.","start":239.692,"stop":259.596,"duration":19.9},{"text":"That is to say, the respondent showed no entitlement subsequent to June 30, 1962.","start":259.596,"stop":268.29,"duration":8.69},{"text":"Accordingly, on the basis of Res judicata the respondent having shown nothing new in the second round proceeding, the Administrative Law Judge rejected his claim.","start":268.29,"stop":281.966,"duration":13.68},{"text":"The respondent then appealed to the Appeals Council, and the Appeals

reopen.","start":322.768,"stop":343.089,"duration":20.32},{"text":"He appealed, the Seventh Circuit dividing decided that although it was correct that Section 205(g) and the Social Security Act are

jurisdiction.","start":343.089,"stop":367.915,"duration":24.83},{"text":"It was in that posture of the case that this Court granted the Government’s petition for

narrative.","start":375.447,"stop":380.811,"duration":5.36},{"text":"One is that although without counsel throughout the Administrative Proceedings, the respondent exercised a number of options pursuing vigorously as he was entitled to do and should have done, the opportunities which the law afforded him to get consideration, reconsideration, and review again and again.","start":380.811,"stop":401.291,"duration":20.48},{"text":"He came back to the Administrative Process after a lapse of more than seven

claimant to come back within a year on virtually no new showing, and ask for reopening.","start":413.795,"stop":424.487,"duration":10.69},{"text":"Within four years, after the final decision denying his claim, he can come back, and if he shows good cause, he can get a reopening.","start":424.487,"stop":434.422,"duration":9.94},{"text":"Good cause usually goes to the evidence, new material evidence.","start":434.422,"stop":441.214,"duration":6.79},{"text":"After four years, he may still go back, at any time, the regulations say, but in that event, he is limited in his return to the administrative process for reopening.","start":441.214,"stop":455.897,"duration":14.68},{"text":"He is limited to showing that there was error of a clerical sort or an error on the face of the evidence.","start":455.897,"stop":462.721,"duration":6.82},{"text":"It was the latter, sort of, evidence which the respondent in this case set up as the error involved, but the record does not say and we do not know to this date what the nature of that error in the evidence is.","start":462.721,"stop":482.196,"duration":19.48},{"text":"The Government’s case here is simple, in two points.","start":482.196,"stop":490.223,"duration":8.03},{"text":"It is that there is no jurisdiction bestowed on the Federal Courts by the Social Security Act to review a reopening denial and that
