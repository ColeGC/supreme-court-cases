uncontroverted facts say, in facts, I think are necessary just as background whereas the plaintiffs are subsidiaries of Treadway Companies which is a chain of bowling centers that operates in the United States and each subsidiary operates a different bowling center.","start":104.486,"stop":126.523,"duration":22.04},{"text":"Brunswick Corporation is one of two largest manufacturers and distributors of bowling equipment in the United States and it is the defendant, the petitioner here.","start":126.523,"stop":136.679,"duration":10.16},{"text":"I should say Your Honor that the reason the litigation arouse is that prior to 1964, the bowling industry, really prior to the early 1960s was in the boom period and the bottom fell out of it.","start":136.679,"stop":153.624,"duration":16.94},{"text":"In around 1963, 1964 there was a precipitous decline and the petitioner found itself on the verge of bankruptcy.","start":153.624,"stop":168.037,"duration":14.41},{"text":"It had borrow $300 million because in selling to the bowling centers, the plaintiffs here, is that on conditional sales with a down payment but with a very substantial portion of it, major portion of the money being on a note basis and it had $400 million outstanding with these bowling centers of which a hundred million dollars was more than 90 days delinquent.","start":168.037,"stop":200.804,"duration":32.77},{"text":"What it needed was someway to get cash flow.","start":200.804,"stop":205.257,"duration":4.45},{"text":"It appraised all of these centers.","start":205.257,"stop":207.757,"duration":2.5},{"text":"It selected those which it thought would give it cash flow.","start":207.757,"stop":212.328,"duration":4.57},{"text":"It first tried to get them to pay and then tried to dispose all of them, dispose of the equipment as the Court of Appeals carefully outlines failing roll back, it took over these stations to operate them where it thought they would create a cash flow and what we have involved here are three local markets in which it took over stations.","start":212.328,"stop":235.456,"duration":23.13},{"text":"Two of them, it took over station that was one of the smaller bowling stations, one of them it found that bowling centers, I should say Your Honors, it found that it simply couldn’t get the cash flow and after few years it just closed it down and left the market, that was Poughkeepsie.","start":235.456,"stop":255.179,"duration":19.72},{"text":"The others that remained in the market, the complaint of the plaintiffs is that it should not have taken over those stations, that if it had not done so, those stations, I calling them stations those bowling centers would have folded and let me tell you, your Honor, I don’t do much bowling.","start":255.179,"stop":279.402,"duration":24.22},{"text":"Those bowling centers would have folded and if they had folded the plaintiffs would have shared with the other centers in each of these three local markets with a business that would thus have been released.","start":279.402,"stop":293.223,"duration":13.82},{"text":"That is the entire theory of the case.","start":293.223,"stop":296.269,"duration":3.05},{"text":"Your Honor is there just for some reason or I guess, I know the reason, the respondents endeavored to change that theory here and I therefore read Your Honor, just what the Court of Appeal said, It happens to be at Page 25(a) of the petition for the Writ Of Certiorari, the thrust of plaintiff section fourth theory was that damages were to be computed by first assuming that each Brunswick acquired center would have closed down at the moment of takeover.","start":296.269,"stop":335.628,"duration":39.36},{"text":"In other words, no one else could have taken over.","start":335.628,"stop":338.06,"duration":2.43},{"text":"They were just closed down.","start":338.06,"stop":341.019,"duration":2.96},{"text":"But for the takeover

years from the time of takeover until the time of the second trial.","start":352.418,"stop":372.915,"duration":20.5},{"text":"There is no showing that there was any difference in facilities.","start":372.915,"stop":376.725,"duration":3.81},{"text":"Indeed the only showing was that three of the independent centers increased their facilities.","start":376.725,"stop":382.183,"duration":5.46},{"text":"No showing except that the defendant gave up completely the Poughkeepsie market, gave up one of its bowling centers in the Paramus market.","start":382.183,"stop":391.747,"duration":9.56},{"text":"The three markets are Paramus in New Jersey, Poughkeepsie in New York and Pueblo in Colorado.","start":391.747,"stop":399.107,"duration":7.36},{"text":"I say, there is no showing of any of those because the case proceeded on the rather simple ground.","start":399.107,"stop":407.153,"duration":8.05},{"text":"Now at the trial there were two, they were charged of the violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and the plaintiff withdrew that.","start":407.153,"stop":410.004,"duration":2.85},{"text":"There was a charge of the violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and this is important because that the Judge in charging the jury took up every bit of evidence of what was called behavioral evidence that the plaintiffs offered every shred of it, and gave it to the jury and said this is for the Section 2 Sherman Act charge and if you find these things are true, then you give a verdict to the defendant, to the plaintiffs and the jury brought in a verdict for the defendant on the Section 2, Sherman Act.","start":410.004,"stop":454.765,"duration":44.76},{"text":"Now, when it came to the Clayton Act, Section 7, there the charge the Court restrict of its charge to a structural charge.","start":454.765,"stop":465.323,"duration":10.56},{"text":"He said the defendant admits that it's number one in bowling.","start":465.323,"stop":470.208,"duration":4.89},{"text":"It's a largest manufacturer in bowling and it serves as a banker for those to whom it sales and finally the Court said that the percentage of bowling center facilities in a local market that Brunswick obtained by the mere act of taking over a bowling center, you find that that was more than insubstantial share, were the Trial Court’s words, if you find that was more than an insubstantial share, say beyond ten percent or fifteen percent, then you may find a verdict for the plaintiffs.","start":470.208,"stop":507.787,"duration":37.58},{"text":"Now, that was the only thing that was -- that’s before this court, the only thing on question one, the only thing that was given to the jury.","start":507.787,"stop":517.73,"duration":9.94},{"text":"When everything else had found for the defendant, my
