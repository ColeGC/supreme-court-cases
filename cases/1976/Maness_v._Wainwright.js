Brummer","textObjs":[{"text":"The petitioner has based his constitutional claim on Sixth Amendment grounds as well as fundamental fairness.","start":24.27,"stop":31.374,"duration":7.1},{"text":"On the basis that the Voucher Rule had been applied to sanctify the testimony of Linda Maness, although Linda was clearly adverse within the definition of adverse set forth in Chambers, the petitioner was unable to cross examine her or to contradict her.","start":31.374,"stop":50.734,"duration":19.36},{"text":"This left her denial of guilt intact before the jury.","start":50.734,"stop":55.053,"duration":4.32},{"text":"Her denial pointed the finger at the petitioner because he was the only other suspect.","start":55.053,"stop":61.421,"duration":6.37},{"text":"The petitioner was also unable to get Linda to admit her guilt on the stand.","start":61.421,"stop":67.491,"duration":6.07},{"text":"There was a reasonable prospect of doing this because Linda had previously made admissions against her penal interest with regard to this case on a number of occasions.","start":67.491,"stop":78.401,"duration":10.91},{"text":"But defense counsel was unable to ask Linda, whether she knew in fact that the petitioner did not do it, because the Trial Court applied the Voucher Rule to preclude this enquiry.","start":78.401,"stop":91.288,"duration":12.89},{"text":"Even if defense counsel would only have elicited from Linda that she had previously stated that the petitioner did not do it, this evidence would have had a dramatic impact upon the jury.","start":91.288,"stop":104.96,"duration":13.67},{"text":"This is especially true in light of the fact that she had testified on the stand that the petitioner was alone at the time, along with the baby at the time that the baby was injured and that she had gone to the store.","start":104.96,"stop":120.335,"duration":15.38},{"text":"It is very important to note that Linda’s testimony is the only evidence which would point the finger of guilt at the petitioner rather than at Linda except for the confession given by the petitioner which he recanted on the stand and attempted to explain away.","start":120.335,"stop":142.623,"duration":22.29},{"text":"His inability to extract the evidence from Linda also hurt his ability to support the recantation of his confession.","start":142.623,"stop":151.017,"duration":8.39},{"text":"Under Washington versus Texas, the petitioner was entitled to use the testimony of the witnesses he had called to the stand.","start":151.017,"stop":158.425,"duration":7.41},{"text":"The situation here is very similar to the situation that this Court condemned in Davis versus Alaska.","start":158.425,"stop":165.738,"duration":7.31},{"text":"It is a deprivation of the right to confrontation and compulsory process.","start":165.738,"stop":170.422,"duration":4.68},{"text":"If you restrict a party to a single question suggesting bias or interest, when an adverse witness answers with a general denial and the party is seeking to adduce relevant and material evidence which is prohibitive in his defense.","start":170.422,"stop":188.752,"duration":18.33},{"text":"Such restriction deprive the petitioner here form revealing the falsehood and bias in Linda’s testimony.","start":188.752,"stop":196.315,"duration":7.56},{"text":"Also it may have appeared to the jury that the defense was engaged in a baseless attack on Linda and this may have hurt the petitioner as well.","start":196.315,"stop":206.433,"duration":10.12},{"text":"We would call the Court’s attention to the opinion of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States versus Torres which is based on this Court’s decision in Chambers.","start":206.433,"stop":217.399,"duration":10.97},{"text":"The situation there paralleled of the situation in Davis.","start":217.399,"stop":222.019,"duration":4.62},{"text":"We would submit that the rights to confrontation and compulsory process are clearly applicable without regard to whether a third-party confession appears in the record.","start":222.019,"stop":235.31,"duration":13.29},{"text":"We based this submission on the cases of Washington, Davis and Torres in edition to this Court’s decision in Chambers.","start":235.31,"stop":246.866,"duration":11.56},{"text":"As early as you direct appeal, the petitioner has argued that the Voucher Rule has been applied to limit the right of the petitioner to use the testimony of Linda and Dana Maness in violation of the Sixth Amendment principles set forth in Washington versus Texas.","start":246.866,"stop":264.876,"duration":18.01},{"text":"In Chambers, this Court set forth a balancing test for evaluation of the constitutionality of a clash between the Sixth Amendment and state evidentiary rules.","start":264.876,"stop":275.704,"duration":10.83},{"text":"The two components are the value and validity of the rule in question, and the second is the impact on the petitioner’s ability to present a defense.","start":275.704,"stop":286.829,"duration":11.13},{"text":"With regard to the first component in this case the Voucher Rule is an irrational rule.","start":286.829,"stop":294.224,"duration":7.39},{"text":"It promotes no state interest whatsoever.","start":294.224,"stop":298.912,"duration":4.69},{"text":"Certainly the respondent has not come forward with any defense or explanation of the rationale for the Rule, or the rationale for the application of the Rule in this particular case.","start":298.912,"stop":311.696,"duration":12.78},{"text":"With regard to the impact of the Rule on the petitioners’ ability to present a defense, we would refer this Court through the findings of the court below to the effect that the Voucher Rule undoubtedly worked to the detriment of the petitioner, and that some evidence suggesting his innocence was excluded.","start":311.696,"stop":333.98,"duration":22.28},{"text":"It is also important to notice that the Court said that the fact finding process had been impaired due to the inability of the petitioner to cross-examine Linda Maness.","start":333.98,"stop":346.984,"duration":13},{"text":"Because there is no legitimate state interest to be a countervailing weight in the balancing test we submit that in the light of the findings of the Fifth Circuit, the conclusion is inexorable, that the record reflects a constitutional violation of the petitioner’s right to fundamental fairness, as well as the Sixth Amendment guarantees incorporated in the Due Process Clause.","start":346.984,"stop":374.367,"duration":27.38},{"text":"In conclusion I would like to briefly address myself to an additional question which the respondent has attempted to smuggle before this Court in his brief on the merits.","start":374.367,"stop":383.447,"duration":9.08},{"text":"The additional question relates to the exhaustion of the state remedies.","start":383.447,"stop":388.03,"duration":4.58},{"text":"We would submit to the Court that this case reflects no reason whatsoever, for this Court to depart from his normal policy to disregard a question when it is not properly before this Court, it was not presented to the court below, and if accepted by this Court would alter rather than affirm the judgment of the court below.","start":388.03,"stop":410.099,"duration":22.07},{"text":"Additionally, substantively the argument is without merit.","start":410.099,"stop":414.993,"duration":4.89},{"text":"The petitioner has presented to the State Courts a claim substantially equivalent to the claim presented to the Federal District Court.","start":414.993,"stop":423.278,"duration":8.29},{"text":"This is the test set forth in the respondent’s brief and in the Fifth Circuit case in Lamberti v. Wainwright, clearly under the exhaustion doctrine repeated application to the State Courts are not necessary and the mere possibility of success in State Court in light of the facts of Chambers v. Mississippi is no bar to federal relief in this case under this Court’s decision in Wilverding.","start":423.278,"stop":448.736,"duration":25.46}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"But it was raised in the Fifth Circuit, wasn’t it?","start":448.736,"stop":451.791,"duration":3.06}]},{"speakerName":"Bennett H.
