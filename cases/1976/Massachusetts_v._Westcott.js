contends that he is also interested in the fisheries of Massachusetts.","start":287.103,"stop":292.454,"duration":5.35},{"text":"However, the fisheries of Massachusetts, I think, account for a way of

primary factor underlying the state’s continuing vitality.","start":314.813,"stop":321.624,"duration":6.81},{"text":"However, just as they are an important resource, the fisheries of Massachusetts are a fragile one.","start":321.624,"stop":327.718,"duration":6.09},{"text":"They are therefore worthy of special protection by the state.","start":327.718,"stop":333.198,"duration":5.48},{"text":"It is our position that this court has set forth a framework, which gives recognition to the unique interest, which the state possesses in its natural resources.","start":333.198,"stop":343.193,"duration":10},{"text":"In the past it has used that framework to answer challenges brought under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.","start":343.193,"stop":349.3,"duration":6.11},{"text":"Specifically, in cases such as McCready v. Virginia, Geer v. Connecticut, and Patsone v. Pennsylvania, the court has ruled that the citizens of a state possess in a collective capacity a property interest in the state’s resources.","start":349.3,"stop":366.923,"duration":17.62},{"text":"The court has further ruled that accordingly, the right of those citizens to use the state’s resources is not a right derived from the citizenship per se but rather a right derived from their citizenship and their property combined.","start":366.923,"stop":381.323,"duration":14.4},{"text":"It is therefore not a privilege or immunity of citizenship guaranteed to the citizens of other states under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.","start":381.323,"stop":390.286,"duration":8.96},{"text":"On only one occasion has the court departed from this analysis, that was in Toomer v. Whitsel decided in 1948.","start":390.286,"stop":399.511,"duration":9.23},{"text":"In Toomer, the court held that the right of the citizens of South Carolina to take migratory shrimp from the three-mile marginal belt located off of that state’s coastline was not a property right but rather was a privilege or immunity of citizenship.","start":399.511,"stop":414.857,"duration":15.35},{"text":"As such it was not a right which could be denied to the citizens of other states.","start":414.857,"stop":419.521,"duration":4.66},{"text":"Massachusetts concedes that if Toomer controls here, Chapter 35 must be held unconstitutional.","start":419.521,"stop":426.041,"duration":6.52},{"text":"However, we contend that Toomer, no longer serves as valid precedent.","start":426.041,"stop":431.882,"duration":5.84},{"text":"The court in Toomer declared that South Carolina did not posses an ownership interest in the shrimp for two reasons.","start":431.882,"stop":439.155,"duration":7.27},{"text":"First, it was the court’s view that migratory animals are by their nature inherently incapable of being owned.","start":439.155,"stop":447.184,"duration":8.03},{"text":"Second, a prior decision of the court had held that that Federal Government possesses paramount control of the resources of the marginal sea such that none of those resources is susceptible to state ownership.","start":447.184,"stop":462.828,"duration":15.64},{"text":"The second basis of the court’s decision in Toomer , namely that the resources of the three-mile belt and one of the paramount control of the federal government has been completely undermined by the passage of this Submerged Lands Act in 1953.","start":462.828,"stop":477.58,"duration":14.75},{"text":"By that legislation, Congress expressly conveyed to the states both title two and ownership in all the resources of the marginal sea.","start":477.58,"stop":486.877,"duration":9.3},{"text":"Accordingly, the states now possess the same rights of ownership in those resources as this court had held them to possess with respect to human resources.","start":486.877,"stop":495.9,"duration":9.02},{"text":"Thus, if Toomer has to control at all in this case, it must be on the first ground articulated by the court, namely that migratory animals are by their nature inherently incapable of being owned.","start":495.9,"stop":508.877,"duration":12.98},{"text":"That ground finds no support in prior Supreme Court adjudication.","start":508.877,"stop":513.828,"duration":4.95},{"text":"This court had never before held that a state’s ownership in migratory animals differed from its ownership in stationary animals.","start":513.828,"stop":522.645,"duration":8.82},{"text":"Even more significantly, the congresses, when it passed the Submerged Lands Act to know such distinction.","start":522.645,"stop":529.358,"duration":6.71},{"text":"In its conveyance, it conveyed title and ownership to all the resources of the marginal sea, specifically all fish.","start":529.358,"stop":538.477,"duration":9.12},{"text":"We submit that the relative mobility of the given species is an illusive concept.","start":538.477,"stop":545.426,"duration":6.95},{"text":"That being true, the appropriateness of the distinction based upon that concept is a matter best left to congressional analysis.","start":545.426,"stop":553.835,"duration":8.41},{"text":"In this instance, Congress has determined that mobility is not the criteria and upon which important right should turn and that being the case, this court should respect this judgment.","start":553.835,"stop":564.141,"duration":10.31},{"text":"We submit that the court should now find that migratory fish located in the
