reversed, although there were several opinions, all of the justices who participated agreed that whether or not warnings were required, a witness could not commit perjury and thereafter claim that the privilege self incrimination was a protection from prosecution for perjury.","start":431.075,"stop":449.78,"duration":18.7},{"text":"And indeed, all of the justices were in agreement that on the facts of the case in Mandujano, there was no due process violation.","start":449.78,"stop":457.572,"duration":7.79},{"text":"The facts here are in all relevant respects the same and we believe the results should be as well.","start":457.572,"stop":465.996,"duration":8.42},{"text":"Now, although the Court of Appeals' rule that its result could not be sustained under the Self Incrimination Clause, respondent has argued that indeed, her position is supported by the Self Incrimination Clause and accordingly, I will take that matter up first.","start":465.996,"stop":481.494,"duration":15.5},{"text":"It is well settled that that constitutional provision does not protect against the crime of perjury.","start":481.494,"stop":488.081,"duration":6.59},{"text":"The opinions in Mandujano to that effect did not state a new doctrine.","start":488.081,"stop":492.104,"duration":4.02},{"text":"In the Glickstein case and the Knox case and the Bryson case, this Court said that coercion may not avoided by perjury.","start":492.104,"stop":500.483,"duration":8.38},{"text":"One central rational behind those cases applies squarely here.","start":500.483,"stop":507.03,"duration":6.55},{"text":"In making the statements that are the subject of the indictment in this case, the respondent was not indeed incriminating herself in regard to a past crime.","start":507.03,"stop":515.159,"duration":8.13},{"text":"She was instead committing a new crime.","start":515.159,"stop":518.692,"duration":3.53},{"text":"However, broad the protection afforded by the privilege, it is not a license to commit perjury.","start":518.692,"stop":527.526,"duration":8.83},{"text":"The respondent argues that this case is not the same as Mandujano, and that the use of her testimony in the prosecution for perjury would violate her privilege.","start":527.526,"stop":537.561,"duration":10.04},{"text":"She says that it was important to the result in Mandujano that in that case, the witness had received warnings and understood warnings apparently, and that she not having understood them and having been in the position therefore of one who had not received warnings will somehow compelled against her will to lie in response to the questions put by the government attorney.","start":537.561,"stop":562.016,"duration":24.45},{"text":"In our view, it was entirely irrelevant in Mandujano that the witness there had received warnings.","start":562.016,"stop":568.941,"duration":6.93},{"text":"And the reason that it was irrelevant is because even if the witness had been compelled to testify in Mandujano, that would not have protected him from a prosecution for perjury.","start":568.941,"stop":581.32,"duration":12.38},{"text":"In support of this proposition, I rely upon the cases that the Court in Mandujano relied upon.","start":581.32,"stop":588.174,"duration":6.85},{"text":"The first of those was the Glickstein case.","start":588.174,"stop":591.34,"duration":3.17},{"text":"There, the defendant testified under the compulsion of the statute that granted him immunity.","start":591.34,"stop":597.485,"duration":6.14},{"text":"This Court said that as a constitutional matter, the privilege against self incrimination could be overborne and the government could compel testimony, even incriminating testimony, provided that it granted an immunity co-extensive with the privilege.","start":597.485,"stop":613.434,"duration":15.95},{"text":"The Court then said that as a corollary to the power, to the government’s power to compel testimony, it must also have the power to assure that whatever the testimony is given in response to that compulsion would be truthful.","start":613.434,"stop":627.591,"duration":14.16},{"text":"In that case, the statute in question was held to confer an immunity no broader than the constitution and the use of the defendant’s testimony was upheld not withstanding that he had given it under compulsion.","start":627.591,"stop":642.026,"duration":14.43},{"text":"The Knox case and the Bryson cases are both much the same.","start":642.026,"stop":645.959,"duration":3.93},{"text":"In Knox, the federal statute made it criminal for certain persons to fail to file a certain form.","start":645.959,"stop":653.033,"duration":7.07},{"text":"In response to this compulsion, Knox filed a form that contained falsehoods, and he was then prosecuted under another statute forbidding false statements.","start":653.033,"stop":662.556,"duration":9.52},{"text":"Even though under Marchetti and Grosso, under those subsequent cases, Knox would have been protected by his privilege from filing any form at all, his filing of a false form was held unprotected.","start":662.556,"stop":675.529,"duration":12.97},{"text":"The court noted that the prosecution was not based on any incriminatory information that was given in submission to compulsion.","start":675.529,"stop":682.701,"duration":7.17},{"text":"Neither was the prosecution in Mandujano, neither is the prosecution here.","start":682.701,"stop":688.143,"duration":5.44},{"text":"When each of these witnesses responded to any pressure that they may have felt that they were under by giving false testimony, that as the court said in Knox was simply not testimonial compulsion.","start":688.143,"stop":700.738,"duration":12.6},{"text":"In Bryson, the Court put the matter quite simply.","start":700.738,"stop":703.367,"duration":2.63},{"text":"There is no privilege to answer fraudulently a question that the government should not have asked.","start":703.367,"stop":709.398,"duration":6.03},{"text":"There is therefore no meaningful difference between this case and Knox, and Bryson and Glickstein, whether or not the witnesses in those case knew that they had a privilege was whether or not they knew that they had a privilege was not important since they cannot realistically have exercised it anyway.","start":709.398,"stop":728.436,"duration":19.04},{"text":"Whether or not the respondent here knew that she had a privilege also did not matter.","start":728.436,"stop":732.563,"duration":4.13},{"text":"Even assuming then that somehow, her failure to know of her privilege resulted in a situation where the government was compelling her to give answers against her will.","start":732.563,"stop":744.072,"duration":11.51},{"text":"There is nothing in the Self Incrimination Clause that requires that her false testimony be suppressed in the prosecution for perjury.","start":744.072,"stop":753.978,"duration":9.91},{"text":"We turn now to the Due Process Clause which was relied upon by the court below.","start":753.978,"stop":757.791,"duration":3.81}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"May I just ask you this before you proceed to that
