case, to petition this court for certiorari from a Supreme Court decision in North Carolina against him.","start":63.026,"stop":73.575,"duration":10.55},{"text":"The question we content and present it here is where the Supreme Court of North Carolina erred in not applying Mullaney retroactively.","start":73.575,"stop":80.883,"duration":7.31},{"text":"Since the doctrine of Mullaney as relates to petitioner?s case greatly affected the fact finding process, the reliability of the fact finding process.","start":80.883,"stop":90.235,"duration":9.35},{"text":"The State Court held that by raising the decision of Mullaney, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the use of their long standing rules in homicide cases, that a defendant in order to rebut the presumption of malice must prove to the satisfaction of the jury that he killed in the heat of sudden passion and to rebut the presumption of unlawfulness that he killed in self defense.","start":90.235,"stop":116.299,"duration":26.06},{"text":"They held that those instructions as they were given in our case violated the concept to Due Process announced by this court in Mullaney.","start":116.299,"stop":125.248,"duration":8.95},{"text":"However, they decline without further guidance from this court to apply it retroactively.","start":125.248,"stop":132.559,"duration":7.31},{"text":"The petitioner contends that the main determination to be made by this court in whether or not to give Mullaney retroactivity is whether or not the major purpose of the new constitutional doctrine as to over come an aspect of a criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth finding function.","start":132.559,"stop":151.461,"duration":18.9},{"text":"The petitioner contends that in order to do that this court must closely scrutinize the major purpose which it held Mullaney to serve.","start":151.461,"stop":161.72,"duration":10.26},{"text":"This court in its opinion on Mullaney relied heavily on Winship.","start":161.72,"stop":169.646,"duration":7.93},{"text":"This court further, in Ivan held Winship to be retroactive.","start":169.646,"stop":174.066,"duration":4.42},{"text":"However, the petitioner contends that this court in its own language in Mullaney, said that the rule that -- whether the major purposes of Mullaney was to protect the integrity of the requirements of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt being carried by the prosecution in criminal cases.","start":174.066,"stop":196.285,"duration":22.22},{"text":"It went on further to say that this major purpose to be served by this rule was at even greater purpose than that which was set forth in Winship and I quote from Mr. Justice Powell?s opinion at Page 700.","start":196.285,"stop":212.37,"duration":16.09},{"text":"?Not only are the interests underlying Winship implicated to a greater degree in this case, but in one respect the protection afforded those interests less here\".","start":212.37,"stop":222.606,"duration":10.24},{"text":"In Winship the ultimate burden of persuasion remained with the prosecution although the standard had been reduced to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.","start":222.606,"stop":231.793,"duration":9.19},{"text":"In this case, that is in the Mullaney case, by contrast that state has affirmatively shifted the burden of proof to defendant.","start":231.793,"stop":240.109,"duration":8.32},{"text":"The result in a case such as this one where the defendant is required to prove the critical fact in dispute is to increase further the likelihood of an erroneous murder conviction.","start":240.109,"stop":253.268,"duration":13.16},{"text":"Therefore, the petitioner contends that this Court has already held in its decision of Mullaney that the major purpose to be served by that rule was to correct an error in the fact finding process, because they have stated this to increase further likelihood and rated as to do away with the increase of the further likelihood of an erroneous murder conviction.","start":253.268,"stop":278.354,"duration":25.09},{"text":"Of necessity in determining whether or not to apply any of these new constitutional rules retroactively, the court must look at prior decisions and whether or not they have given those decisions perspective only or retroactive applications.","start":278.354,"stop":293.972,"duration":15.62},{"text":"However, the petitioner in this case contends that you need only look to Ivan as far as it relates to the case of the bar, because of the fact that Mullaney says that the interest to be protected in Mullaney itself are greater than those on Winship.","start":293.972,"stop":313.852,"duration":19.88},{"text":"That, here, it is not only proof beyond a reasonable doubt to be protected but further that it places the burden solely on the state to carry this burden.","start":313.852,"stop":326.385,"duration":12.53},{"text":"That is to say in the Winship case it was proved by a preponderance of the evidence but at all time that proof rested solely upon the prosecution.","start":326.385,"stop":337.293,"duration":10.91},{"text":"In Mullaney, it removes that burden of proof or the main rule which was corrected by this court in Mullaney, move that burden of proof or shift to that burden of proof to the defendant.","start":337.293,"stop":350.791,"duration":13.5},{"text":"In the main case, or the Mullaney case, this court stated that in main itself, the prosecution was required to prove the absence of self defense beyond a reasonable doubt.","start":350.791,"stop":365.502,"duration":14.71},{"text":"Now, in North Carolina until the Hankerson decision, that is the case which is at the bar, the defendant himself had to satisfy the jury that he did act in self defense.","start":365.502,"stop":377.167,"duration":11.66},{"text":"That is to say that the burden of proof was shifted from the state to the defendant to come forward and satisfy the jury of the four things necessary for them to return the verdict of acquittal on the grounds of self defense.","start":377.167,"stop":391.886,"duration":14.72},{"text":"So, the petitioner honestly contends that while a review of all of the other cases involving retroactivity and being applied perspectively is important.","start":391.886,"stop":404,"duration":12.11},{"text":"This court need look no further than the language of Mullaney and applying it with Ivan and
