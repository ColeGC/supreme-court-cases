Schilder, where the Court through it would have required a strain to read the finality language as other than the exhaustion of remedies provision and if refused to strain the language in order to reach a constitutional issue.","start":316.612,"stop":335.633,"duration":19.02},{"text":"I think this can be made clear if you ask yourself, what would congress do?","start":335.633,"stop":341.337,"duration":5.7},{"text":"If it meant this to be a denial of jurisdiction, what would it do after the Court of Appeals’ decision in order to make that fact clear.","start":341.337,"stop":352.075,"duration":10.74},{"text":"I cannot think of anything, that will make it clear unless it italicize that language in the code, and then said, we really mean the italicized language.","start":352.075,"stop":362.261,"duration":10.19},{"text":"It is done as much as it can to make this point.","start":362.261,"stop":366.285,"duration":4.02},{"text":"Now, there is much argument about the legislative history in this case.","start":366.285,"stop":369.471,"duration":3.19},{"text":"The truth is there is very little legislative history in this case; it is very enlightened.","start":369.471,"stop":375.753,"duration":6.28},{"text":"But, the Court of Appeals to some extent responded, used an argument which is a wide variety of arguments none of which from the legislative history really go to overturn the language in the text, but we do know two things.","start":375.753,"stop":394.16,"duration":18.41},{"text":"We do know that Congress intended to remove local matters from the Federal District Courts.","start":394.16,"stop":403.64,"duration":9.48},{"text":"We know that the statute does that as we read it, and that supports it, but more importantly is the fact that Section 110 (g) is model.","start":403.64,"stop":412.662,"duration":9.02},{"text":"The Congress said, it was using as a model 28 U.S.C. 2255 and indeed the language is almost identical.","start":412.662,"stop":423.823,"duration":11.16},{"text":"We know that 2255 the post conviction relief statute is not an exhaustion of remedy statute, it is a jurisdictional statute.","start":423.823,"stop":433.409,"duration":9.59},{"text":"It says that you must go back to the sentencing court to get your post conviction relief, you may go and replace else and that tends to remove the jurisdiction from all other courts, but the sentencing court.","start":433.409,"stop":446.113,"duration":12.7},{"text":"110 (g) copies that language and removes jurisdiction from any court other than the sentencing court, which in this case is the Superior Court.","start":446.113,"stop":457.241,"duration":11.13},{"text":"I suppose if there is any difference between the two and there is, it is that 110 (g) is even clear, because whereas 2255 simply says that the motion shall not be entertained, language was added to 110 (g) in the District Court and say the motion shall not be entertained by the Superior Court or by any Federal or State Court which (Inaudible).","start":457.241,"stop":483.512,"duration":26.27},{"text":"Now, against all of this the Court of Appeals replaces reliance one, two points, the first one is that the local court system of District of Columbia, the Article I court system was intended to be in many respects analogous to a state court system, and that is quite true, but an analogy is by no means of identity.","start":483.512,"stop":502.682,"duration":19.17},{"text":"This system differs in many respects, and one of them is the respect, which is plainly before us here.","start":502.682,"stop":509.233,"duration":6.55},{"text":"The second part of reliance was the Congress could not have meant what it plainly said because that would have provoked heated constitutional debate, and there was none.","start":509.233,"stop":521.078,"duration":11.84},{"text":"The answer to that is that there was no constitutional excitement, because Congress had done the same thing 20 years before, and there had been no constitutional excitement about that and it probably could completely do the same thing again.","start":521.078,"stop":538.805,"duration":17.73},{"text":"Under 2255 collateral attacks, upon sentences imposed by territorial courts organized in the Article IV of the constitution, and non Article III court must be brought exclusively by motion in those courts, which is parallel to situation here.","start":538.805,"stop":555.811,"duration":17.01},{"text":"No court has suggested that the unconstitutional will send those is unconstitutional to require a person convicted in the territorial court to go back for his post-conviction relief under 2255 to that sentencing court.","start":555.811,"stop":568.389,"duration":12.58},{"text":"So there was no occasion for Congress to think that there was anything unique or exciting or troublesome about what it was doing in the statute.","start":568.389,"stop":581.569,"duration":13.18},{"text":"I think the statutory argument is clear, so I turn to the constitutional argument.","start":581.569,"stop":587.02,"duration":5.45},{"text":"Now, the constitutional objection really is that although respondent maybe constitutionally convicted and sentenced in an Article I court created for the District Court of Columbia.","start":587.02,"stop":602.59,"duration":15.57},{"text":"He may not be required to seek his post-conviction relief in that same court.","start":602.59,"stop":608.723,"duration":6.13},{"text":"I think this court’s decision in United States against Palmore affectively disposes of that contention is implausible that a person who can be tried initially, constitutionally in such a court may not have his post-conviction relief motion determined by such a court.","start":608.723,"stop":630.571,"duration":21.85},{"text":"I think that is not with the case, but the argument is dressed up here by a statement that to require a convict to go back to the Superior Court is to spend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, which contravenes Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 of the constitution and also the Court of Appeals suggested contravenes the protection concept of the Due Process clause.","start":630.571,"stop":662.182,"duration":31.61},{"text":"Neither of those claims I think is plausible after Palmore and I will say a few words.","start":662.182,"stop":668.339,"duration":6.16},{"text":"The suggestion that 110 (g) violates the suspension clause is dispose quite quickly I think.","start":668.339,"stop":675.124,"duration":6.78},{"text":"It is our position expressed in our brief that history shows that the guarantee of the suspension clause was not intended to apply to any post-conviction applications for habeas corpus.","start":675.124,"stop":689.685,"duration":14.56},{"text":"At the time the constitution was drafted and adopted, the common law rule was that the post-conviction application for habeas corpus could be defeated by showing that there was a judgment in conviction by a criminal court of general jurisdiction, and that is our position so the Congress would be free to wish to suspend the writ entirely, but we don’t rest upon that.","start":689.685,"stop":713.598,"duration":23.91},{"text":"Our main point, we may not reach that historical point because our main point is clear that what was done here was in no sense a suspension of the privilege of the writ.","start":713.598,"stop":723.624,"duration":10.03},{"text":"It’s exactly the motion under 110 (g) or under 110 is exactly commensurate with the writ of habeas corpus as is exactly commensurate with 2255, so there is no suspension of the writ in this case.","start":723.624,"stop":744.476,"duration":20.85},{"text":"The nature of the relief is the same.","start":744.476,"stop":746.225,"duration":1.75},{"text":"The grounds upon which it can be cited are the same, the procedure is the same, and the only difference that is pointed to is that the court considered the motion is to create under Article I rather than the Article III because I say I think Palmore answers that contention, because if Article I court given the special powers of Congress or the District of Columbia is capable of providing a legitimate constitutional trial, and I think is capable of providing a legitimate constitutional post-conviction review.","start":746.225,"stop":786.652,"duration":40.43},{"text":"Besides, it is clear that we are dealing that the purpose of the suspension clause was to prevent the effective denial of the writ altogether and was not to regulate -- prohibit Congress from regulating the details, its procedural details.","start":786.652,"stop":806.747,"duration":20.09},{"text":"Otherwise, if that is not true we are going to get in the questions about whether the new rules which allow the dismissal of a motion one of the latest filing prejudices the government was that is a suspension or the privilege of the writ or as the rules were originally promulgated, I understand that they required, is that an application under 2255(b) sworn to during oath.","start":806.747,"stop":831.721,"duration":24.97},{"text":"Let us suppose we have an argument about whether that is a suspension of the writ.","start":831.721,"stop":835.506,"duration":3.78},{"text":"I think it is quite clear that those procedural details are not -- would beyond Congress’s power by this suspension clause, and certainly here when you have federal judges appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, 15-year terms and with a post-conviction procedure, which is specified by the Congress and is as broad as the writ of habeas corpus.","start":835.506,"stop":866.586,"duration":31.08},{"text":"It seems to me that it is impossible to say that there is any suspension of the writ.","start":866.586,"stop":874.289,"duration":7.7},{"text":"The Court of Appeals had attained some speculations about the equal protection concept, which respondent has not pressed here particularly, but I think I should mention him any of them because they are in the opinion below.","start":874.289,"stop":888.702,"duration":14.41},{"text":"The theory apparently is that equal protection maybe in question, because under 28 U.S.C. 2254, a person convicted in the state court may petition an Article III Court for post-conviction collateral attack.","start":888.702,"stop":908.352,"duration":19.65},{"text":"While a Superior Court found that the District of Columbia must petition in Article I court.","start":908.352,"stop":914.205,"duration":5.85},{"text":"It seems to me that this is nothing more than the Suspension Clause argument all over again, ends up once more in for that reason it’s answered by the Palmore decision.","start":914.205,"stop":923.701,"duration":9.5},{"text":"The argument whether it is a suspension clause or whether it is placed in the equal protection context is always contains the hidden assumption that the Superior Court is less legitimate in some way than an Article III court is, and if that assumption is rejected as it was in Palmore then I think there is no equal protection issue here just as there is no Suspension Clause issue here, and I think that is the end of the matter but I suppose there are two other or few other points that should be mentioned.","start":923.701,"stop":955.629,"duration":31.93},{"text":"The equal protection concept obviously does not encompass the right to deprive the particular tribunal.","start":955.629,"stop":963.048,"duration":7.42},{"text":"If the remedies available are equal then I think there is no problem.","start":963.048,"stop":968.83,"duration":5.78}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
