the General Mills case which involves packaged wheat flower.","start":186.568,"stop":201.011,"duration":14.44},{"text":"Although, there were a number of issues that were decided by the lower courts the principle holding of both United States District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is that the California Statute and its interpreter regulation are preempted by federal law, more specifically, the Federal Wholesome Meat Act of 1967 in the Rath Packing Company case and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act in the General Mills case.","start":201.011,"stop":242.63,"duration":41.62},{"text":"The issue of preemption is the only issue that petitioner has raised in the petition to this

“Lot.”","start":271.043,"stop":274.953,"duration":3.91},{"text":"A lot maybe defined as a group of apparently identical packages found at the same place and at the same

followed by the inspection officers in California does not involve inspection of each package in a lot.","start":302.733,"stop":315.249,"duration":12.52},{"text":"Obviously, that would be too expensive and too time consuming.","start":315.249,"stop":321.734,"duration":6.48},{"text":"Instead, under the California System in Article 5 is how we ordinarily refer to the California Regulation, provides for lot averaging and this is done through random sampling.","start":321.734,"stop":339.176,"duration":17.44},{"text":"For example, in the example that I gave in the lot of 500 packages, the inspection officer would select 25 samples and he would take them from various parts of this lot so that he would get a group of representative samples of the lot.","start":339.176,"stop":365.933,"duration":26.76},{"text":"These are taken at random.","start":365.933,"stop":368.495,"duration":2.56},{"text":"These packages are weighed and the net weight of

approved.","start":377.581,"stop":388.151,"duration":10.57},{"text":"If the lot average net weight is less than the labeled weight, then the entire lot is ordered off sale.","start":388.151,"stop":400.033,"duration":11.88},{"text":"Now, this system that’s followed in California is a statically valid system and it has so been held by United State District Court.","start":400.033,"stop":412.44,"duration":12.41},{"text":"One of the basic defenses that has been raised by the respondents is that the California System does not provide for reasonable variations, that is variations cause by discrepancies in manufacturing processes or gain or loss of moisture during the course of good distribution practices.","start":412.44,"stop":445.151,"duration":32.71},{"text":"However, we wish to respond to this argument and that is that the California System does provide for reasonable variations and that these variations are taken into account through the lot averaging system.","start":445.151,"stop":462.534,"duration":17.38},{"text":"In other words, variations are inherent by the very use of the lot averaging system.","start":462.534,"stop":472.655,"duration":10.12},{"text":"Although, there is no specific mention in the California Regulation as to variations caused by loss or gain of moisture, variations under the state system can be for any reason or for all reasons.","start":472.655,"stop":493.651,"duration":21},{"text":"We must emphasize that contrary to what the respondents would have the Court believe, reasonable variations do not mean shortages below the lot average.","start":493.651,"stop":510.067,"duration":16.42},{"text":"This warning was clearly set out in handbook 67,

errors.","start":531.697,"stop":539.449,"duration":7.75},{"text":"To the extent the time permits, I will discuss one of the errors and Mr. Goodman will discuss the other two.","start":539.449,"stop":548.709,"duration":9.26},{"text":"The first one or the first error is the determination by the court with regard to the time when accuracy of weights and measures is to be determined.","start":548.709,"stop":565.05,"duration":16.34},{"text":"The second error is in the court’s interpretation of the concurrent jurisdiction provisions in Section 408 of the Wholesome Meat Act which maybe found in Title XXI, Section 678.","start":565.05,"stop":579.566,"duration":14.52},{"text":"And thirdly, the error by the court in its interpretation of the provisions of the Fair
