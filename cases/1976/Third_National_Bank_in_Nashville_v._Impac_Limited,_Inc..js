bank.","start":605.159,"stop":626.428,"duration":21.27},{"text":"The Court clearly rejected the argument that the anti-injunction proviso of Section 91 is somehow limited by its preceding provisions

collateral.","start":736.93,"stop":752.048,"duration":15.12},{"text":"The final decision was in 1905 in Van Reed versus People's National Bank, which reaffirmed the holding of Mixter again in an
