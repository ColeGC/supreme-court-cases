essentially provides that Christiana is to turn over all its assets, consisting almost entirely of its Du Pont stock and will then

that Du Pont is putting back.","start":259.591,"stop":277.031,"duration":17.44},{"text":"So under the effect of the transaction is really a liquidation of Christiana that will cost its shareholders approximately 1.8% of its assets.","start":277.031,"stop":290.729,"duration":13.7},{"text":"Now, that comes to less than 2.5% of the difference, because of course the same Christiana stockholders will

stockholders.","start":290.729,"stop":324.194,"duration":33.47},{"text":"The great advantage of course to the, or one of the advantages to the Christiana’s stockholders by this kind of a merger is

holders.","start":415.097,"stop":435.67,"duration":20.57},{"text":"The merger is subject to the Commission approval because 17(a) of the Act provides that an affiliate of an investment company, which

consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching”.","start":435.67,"stop":475.082,"duration":39.41},{"text":"The Commission made this fairness finding on

injured.","start":512.299,"stop":520.378,"duration":8.08},{"text":"They would be benefited in fact to the extent that each share would represent a somewhat greater interest in Du Pont, there being 188,500 fewer Du Pont shares outstanding after the merger than before.","start":520.378,"stop":539.204,"duration":18.83},{"text":"In addition, the Du Pont Company would get some $34 million of the

findings.","start":552.437,"stop":562.495,"duration":10.06},{"text":"There is no public interest consideration that is spelled into the statute at this point, but the Commission did indicate that the elimination of the unnecessary holding Company was sound and salutary, pointing to the provisions of Section 11(b) of the Holding Company Act, where the Commission of course has been instructed to get rid of, and has over the years done so, of many of the unnecessary holding companies in the Electric and Gas Holding Company systems.","start":562.495,"stop":598.876,"duration":36.38},{"text":"The

along.","start":639.228,"stop":663.017,"duration":23.79},{"text":"I propose to deal in the rest of my time with the justification of the Commission’s use of asset value, essentially the value of
