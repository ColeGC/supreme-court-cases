of the case.","start":108.175,"stop":112.687,"duration":4.51},{"text":"I didn't raise the issue of whether the material was obscene or not because as I understand Miller, the only question asked to the content of the material is whether or not it is the type that is -- that could be found by properly instructed jury to be obscene.","start":112.687,"stop":129.019,"duration":16.33},{"text":"The two films here graphically display ultimate sexual acts, they are not simulated.","start":129.019,"stop":133.294,"duration":4.28},{"text":"And therefore, they are the type that could be found obscene if the jury were properly instructed.","start":133.294,"stop":138.545,"duration":5.25},{"text":"In this case, we claim that evidence was improperly introduced and that the jury was not properly instructed and that's why there was a conviction, but it's because of the holding in Miller that we have not raised at this point a claim as to the content for the material.","start":138.545,"stop":153.858,"duration":15.31},{"text":"I might also point out that the term hardcore as used in this case by the participants was not a concession that the material was obscene but only that the material graphically displayed ultimate sex acts.","start":153.858,"stop":167.665,"duration":13.81},{"text":"In other words, in 1969 and 1970, the state of the art was what was publicly for sale was simulated.","start":167.665,"stop":174.941,"duration":7.28},{"text":"That is borne out by the record and I would refer you to pages 515 through 517, 574, 619, 683 and 684 and 762 in which all of the people who had anything to do with the store and Mr. Drivon, the policeman, indicated that they were talking about material which actually showed sex acts rather than which showed simulated sexual acts.","start":174.941,"stop":200.816,"duration":25.88},{"text":"In any event, Drivon in order to accomplish the test of acquiring some hardcore material, some material which graphically displayed sexual behavior which require to make six contexts with the store, only one of those contexts was with the petitioner, Mr. Splawn, and I think it is significant that at that context, the petitioner told Mr. Drivon that he could go to San Francisco and get these films himself if he wish and Mr. Drivon begged off from that invitation.","start":200.816,"stop":231.076,"duration":30.26},{"text":"Finally, then after six contexts, Drivon purchased two films for $70 for which petitioner was convicted.","start":231.076,"stop":239.283,"duration":8.21},{"text":"He had been tried not only for the crime of displaying and distributing obscene material but also on the felony conspiracy charge

issue arises because the pandering law of California which was incorporated into instructions was not in effect at the time that the defendant or the petitioner sold films for which he was subsequently convicted.","start":276.989,"stop":293.47,"duration":16.48}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Wells, let me just ask you primarily

questions.","start":308.874,"stop":315.381,"duration":6.51},{"text":"Because the law was not none in effect at the time, an ex post facto which it was raised.Similarly, the California Supreme Court less than two years before the sale which is the subject matter to this lawsuit had ruled that pandering was not part of California law, and therefore, a question arises under the Due Process Clause and Bouie versus Columbia as to whether there was a new and novel and unfair application of state law to this defendant such that he was denied due process.","start":315.381,"stop":350.611,"duration":35.23},{"text":"The behavior engaged in by the -- by the petitioner in this case displays no more than a simple sale and the Court of Appeals opinion which is here in question, refers to no behavior by the petitioner except that of a simple sale.","start":350.611,"stop":364.166,"duration":13.56},{"text":"Under the circumstances, the question is raised about whether the pandering instructions both based on the law and as given by the Court in this case should have been given at all because in the petitioner's view, these instructions are lopsided.","start":364.166,"stop":379.13,"duration":14.96},{"text":"They do not fairly represent the proposition for which they supposed to support instead they represent only a prosecution view.","start":379.13,"stop":388.763,"duration":9.63},{"text":"Third, on the assumption that it was properly give instructions on the subject of the contexts in the behavior rather than just on the subject matter of the material, of course, it is presented as to whether these instructions are proper.","start":388.763,"stop":401.741,"duration":12.98},{"text":"Now, I would like to discuss these matters in reverse order.","start":401.741,"stop":407.274,"duration":5.53},{"text":"I think Miller, if it teaches us one thing, says that local juries and local jurisdictions are going to have a lot more to say about what is and what is not obscene.","start":407.274,"stop":419.954,"duration":12.68},{"text":"This Court sits not to find what is obscene but just as it check to determine what is not obscene.","start":419.954,"stop":426.76,"duration":6.81},{"text":"I think if you are going to have rules which say that you're going to have a not completely defined local community as the community by which the judge was obscene.","start":426.76,"stop":436.593,"duration":9.83},{"text":"And if you're going to have a rule that requires no evidence at all except the material itself, they introduce to support a conviction in what you have to insists on is properly instructed jury.","start":436.593,"stop":449.306,"duration":12.71},{"text":"I urge this Court to elaborate on and adopt its recent remarks in Footnote 11 of Marks versus U.S. which is to the effect that there is no substitute for properly instructed jury.","start":449.306,"stop":461.281,"duration":11.98},{"text":"I think this especially important in a case like this because what we're talking about is the content of books and movies and other material, which by the way is pure speech, this isn't picketing case, this isn't an O'Brien situations, this isn't anything but pure speech.","start":461.281,"stop":479.84,"duration":18.56},{"text":"And I think what we're talking about is questions of aesthetics, questions of taste and questions of social value and we're trying to convey to a group of layman what it is that they have to do to make a judgment which can rise to a level of constitutional judgment.","start":479.84,"stop":497.117,"duration":17.28},{"text":"Now, I think then that what we need is as much clarity and precision as we can get.","start":497.117,"stop":501.531,"duration":4.41},{"text":"Otherwise, we have no insurance, the jury is located someplace else and without the necessary guidance of any evidence with the material itself and applying a local community is going to do what you nine people wanted to do or what -- a larger group than that wanted to do.","start":501.531,"stop":519.259,"duration":17.73},{"text":"Therefore, I think it's very important to stick to what we have if that's what we have to live with.","start":519.259,"stop":527.317,"duration":8.06},{"text":"Now, the worst, the most glaring example of error I think are the instructions as given is the instruction that says that the jury is permitted to look to the sexually provocative aspects of the matter to determine if the material lacks value.","start":527.317,"stop":545.24,"duration":17.92},{"text":"Now if they find the material is sexually provocative, that fact alone is enough to find that the material lacked value.","start":545.24,"stop":553.861,"duration":8.62},{"text":"This to me is an extremely insidious instruction for the following reason.","start":553.861,"stop":558.387,"duration":4.53},{"text":"The core thing in the obscenity field, the thing that has been with us since Roth is the notion of prurience.","start":558.387,"stop":566.411,"duration":8.02},{"text":"If there is any governmental interest at all in -- in this field, if there is any reason for the States to be in it at all, it is only because this material on some theory or supported by some set of facts is harmful, is unhealthy and that's what prurience means.","start":566.411,"stop":583.78,"duration":17.37},{"text":"Prurience indicates this obsessive compulsion with the unhealthy aspects of sex.","start":583.78,"stop":592.544,"duration":8.76},{"text":"Provocativeness is an entirely different thing.","start":592.544,"stop":596.077,"duration":3.53},{"text":"Provocativeness has to do with arousal, being aroused, being excited, being provoke and that is not necessarily unhealthy.","start":596.077,"stop":606.023,"duration":9.95},{"text":"Now, what happens is this.","start":606.023,"stop":608.054,"duration":2.03},{"text":"Prurience, as far as, I can see is a difficult concept.","start":608.054,"stop":613.044,"duration":4.99},{"text":"It's a difficult term because you're dealing of health and lack of health in a large community of people who you have to judge it by.","start":613.044,"stop":620.969,"duration":7.93},{"text":"And I don't think that the layman, the common juror is acquainted with the term prurience, uses it or things in terms of those notions.","start":620.969,"stop":627.844,"duration":6.88},{"text":"On the other hand, provocativeness especially sexual provocativeness is something that we all grow up with.","start":627.844,"stop":633.354,"duration":5.51},{"text":"Chewing gum, cars, there is nothing that is not sold partially on the basis of provocativeness and usually sexual provocativeness.","start":633.354,"stop":642.875,"duration":9.52},{"text":"Cigarettes for years were sold with implied -- and still are in billboards but not on television, implied sexual attractiveness from smoking.","start":642.875,"stop":651.82,"duration":8.95},{"text":"I therefore think that what happens if you permit the type of instruction given here and what indeed probably did happen here is that the jury says to itself, but we're supposed to deal with this notion of prurience but I'm not too sure what it is.","start":651.82,"stop":664.193,"duration":12.37},{"text":"And under Miller, maybe we don't have any evidence regarding it but the judge said something about provocativeness, maybe I'll look at it and see if I think it's provocative.","start":664.193,"stop":673.392,"duration":9.2},{"text":"If it's provocative, then I don't have to worry about the rest and so they substitute provocativeness or a judgment about whether the material is provocative for a judgment about whether the material is prurient.","start":673.392,"stop":684.914,"duration":11.52},{"text":"And that is the worst possible thing that can be done in this field for the reason that the only reason for having the rules about obscenity if there are any reasons is that the material is unhealthy.","start":684.914,"stop":696.975,"duration":12.06},{"text":"And if the judgment is made on the basis of provocativeness rather than prurience, then you're not making the judgment on the basis of the material is unhealthy but just that it excites or arouses somebody.","start":696.975,"stop":708.289,"duration":11.31},{"text":"And the fact -- the fact that something arouses or excites somebody is probably one of the reasons why it should have First Amendment protection, not one of the reasons that it shouldn't.","start":708.289,"stop":716.868,"duration":8.58},{"text":"And of course the other thing about the term sexual provocativeness is that it's vague.","start":716.868,"stop":721.263,"duration":4.39},{"text":"Vague in both the senses that it's not final enough that we can draw a line so that we can protect -- protected speech and not protect -- not protected speech and vague in the sense that you are using the term can't tell me what I'm supposed to do and so I don't have any real notice about what I'm supposed to do and the jury has no real notice about what its supposed to do.","start":721.263,"stop":745.908,"duration":24.64},{"text":"The other fundamental area in the instruction -- and the instructions in this case was the instruction which permitted the jury to look again at the material after it supposedly applied the three tests which at that time we have to pull a memoir's test and judge it in terms of the intent of the creator.","start":745.908,"stop":766.011,"duration":20.1},{"text":"Whatever maybe the value of such a test, it has never been applied by this Court in the case of a retail seller.","start":766.011,"stop":773.775,"duration":7.76},{"text":"Hamling was a producer, Ginzburg was a producer, Rebhuhn, who in 1940 was the person about whom Learned Hand wrote the opinion which you said was a good opinion in Ginzburg, was the man who mailed out -- made and mailed out the flyers in that case and its never been applied to a person in any event, the man isn't on trial.","start":773.775,"stop":796.404,"duration":22.63},{"text":"That is to say the -- the publisher is not on trial.","start":796.404,"stop":801.004,"duration":4.6},{"text":"So what you do is you look again at the material and you say, “Well, what is the intent of the person who made this material?”","start":801.004,"stop":810.211,"duration":9.21},{"text":"Now, that should never be the judgment about whether the material is obscene or not because what we're trying to do is get to an objective standard.","start":810.211,"stop":817.773,"duration":7.56},{"text":"We are trying to apply a standard which is a standard of lack of health, unhealthiness, and the motives of the creator are not what we're talking about when we're talking about prurience.","start":817.773,"stop":830.442,"duration":12.67},{"text":"If you want to get the creator of the material, then you use the investigative facilities to go arrest him and -- on this type of theory.","start":830.442,"stop":841.089,"duration":10.65},{"text":"I supposed you're trying for something like attempt to make a dirty book or attempt to make obscene books, then you're talking solely about his -- his motives.","start":841.089,"stop":850.495,"duration":9.41},{"text":"Under this, you have a subjective standard instead of an objective standard and once again, it redefines any of the tests laid down by this Court and because it's easier for the jury to apply that kind of a test, just look at the -- we know what he was trying to do, then they're going to substitute that test for the law.","start":850.495,"stop":873.441,"duration":22.95},{"text":"Now, the next point is a question about whether these instructions should have been given at all.","start":873.441,"stop":880.358,"duration":6.92},{"text":"To this extent, I think Ginzburg is a confusing case.","start":880.358,"stop":884.89,"duration":4.53},{"text":"What happen in Ginzburg is that, there was a holding that context was important, but the context to that case was that a publisher exploited his materials.","start":884.89,"stop":900.011,"duration":15.12},{"text":"And the question is, whether you're going to have a rule which permits the context to be considered or not.","start":900.011,"stop":908.956,"duration":8.95},{"text":"In this case, what -- what California did, is first of all, would pass a statute, they didn't say consider the whole context.","start":908.956,"stop":915.639,"duration":6.68},{"text":"It said, see if the guy is misusing the material, and I admit that was part of Ginzburg verus United States, but that's only because of the facts of Ginzburg which were entirely different from the facts here, mainly because you have a publisher and control there and you don't have one here.","start":915.639,"stop":930.453,"duration":14.81},{"text":"Here, what you have is a retailer and if you don't limit the rules somehow and let him know what he can do and not do, there is no way he is going to have any idea and I think its really going to leave to a self--censorship thing, merely putting --","start":930.453,"stop":946.524,"duration":16.07}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

introduced on a pandering theory show the inside of the store and they show magazines displayed in their covers.","start":961.693,"stop":980.949,"duration":19.26},{"text":"I would urge, I am reading over my brief, I see that -- well, I complained a lot that the conviction was improper.","start":980.949,"stop":986.525,"duration":5.58},{"text":"I did not suggest what would be an appropriate rule and I think the object -- the court's opinion, if its reaches this issue, should be to limit the application of this rule if you're going to have it at all to a very finite definite set of circumstances because otherwise in a field where I feel that you're at your limits of possible use of words to be able to convey ideas, you just can't go any further.","start":986.525,"stop":1018.975,"duration":32.45},{"text":"Now, I would point out that Ginzburg permitted the use of this doctrine as a rebuttal tool, quickly -- strictly a question in that

with this material and it wasn't a material itself, he was exploiting it, okay.","start":1033.172,"stop":1046.063,"duration":12.89},{"text":"And then he run into Court and said, “Oh, this is really pure stuff.”","start":1046.063,"stop":1049.938,"duration":3.88},{"text":"Now, as a mere factual rebuttal to that, the Government said, wait minute, you said one thing out there just to show that

that.","start":1049.938,"stop":1067.902,"duration":17.96},{"text":"If you're not going to do that, if you're going to go further, then I would say that you should limit a behavior which is unambiguous exploitation because what you have to do is draw the distinction between commercial exploitation and commercial behavior.","start":1067.902,"stop":1085.026,"duration":17.12},{"text":"If you don't
