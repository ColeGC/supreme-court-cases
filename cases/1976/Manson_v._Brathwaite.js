during the trial, through Officer Glover, the State offered testimonial evidence of the photographic identification and the photo itself, and Officer Glover made a positive in-court identification of Brathwaite.","start":461.25,"stop":482.307,"duration":21.06},{"text":"Now the principal issue before this Court, as I understand it, is whether the case of Stovall and Denno, which this Court decided in June 1967, established a strict exclusionary rules, such that the admission of evidence of a pretrial identification, an unnecessary and suggestive pretrial identification, renders a criminal accuse, conviction and violation of due process standards.","start":482.307,"stop":515.206,"duration":32.9},{"text":"That is what the Federal Appeals Court said in reversing the decision of the United States District Court that Stovall did establish such a rule and that the rule was violated by the State.","start":515.206,"stop":529.339,"duration":14.13},{"text":"Now the petitioner has conceded that the procedure which the police used was suggestive and that it did consist of one photo show up, and we’ve also considered that the procedure used by the police was unnecessary, because there really was no emergency that existed and no exigent circumstances that would have prohibited the police from restoring to some more reliable technique.","start":529.339,"stop":564.723,"duration":35.38},{"text":"We dispute the fact, however, that the suggestiveness was in anyway pronounced or aggravated or even remotely like that, which existed in the Foster case, Foster and California, which was decided after Stovall, I believe, in 1969.","start":564.723,"stop":581.557,"duration":16.83},{"text":"And I emphasize in making that point that it detective D’Onofrio knew Brathwaite by sight, that he had seen him on a number of prior occasions, and that he recognized the description which Glover gave him.","start":581.557,"stop":597.307,"duration":15.75},{"text":"And I also stress that D’Onofrio was not present when Glover made his identification from the photograph and exerted no verbal influence upon him.","start":597.307,"stop":611.637,"duration":14.33},{"text":"What we are saying is that although the pretrial photo identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, there was no great likelihood of any misidentification under all of the facts.","start":611.637,"stop":629.881,"duration":18.24},{"text":"Now with respect to the issue before Your Honors, the existence or nonexistence of a strict rule of exclusion, nowhere in the language of Mr. Justice Brennan’s opinion in the Stovall case, and I am referring to Part 2 of that opinion, nowhere did the words ‘exclusionary rule’ or ‘strict exclusionary rule’ appear.","start":629.881,"stop":655.619,"duration":25.74},{"text":"What the Court said on Page 302 of that opinion is that, “A claimed violation of due process of law or the conduct of a confrontation depends on the totality of the circumstances which surrounded.”","start":655.619,"stop":672.351,"duration":16.73},{"text":"And the same overriding principle was restated about a year after Stovall, in the Simmons case recorded in 390 U.S. and in that case, Mr. Justice Harlan said, “We hold that each case must be considered on its own facts”, and he went on later in the opinion to say that convictions will be set aside, only if the procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.","start":672.351,"stop":707.676,"duration":35.33},{"text":"Now in April of 1969, the Foster case to which I have alluded, Foster against California, adopted the same language residing that identification procedure should be judged “in the totality of the circumstances”, and Your Honors I am sure will recall that in that case there were repeated procedures used by the police which the Court said violated due process, and that conviction, I believe, was reversed.","start":707.676,"stop":734.563,"duration":26.89}]},{"speakerName":"Potter
