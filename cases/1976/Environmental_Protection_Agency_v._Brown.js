Court.","start":98.698,"stop":103.405,"duration":4.71},{"text":"These cases are here on writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth, Ninth and District of Columbia Circuits.","start":103.405,"stop":111.234,"duration":7.83},{"text":"At issue are the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 and regulations promulgated by EPA requiring respondents to take certain actions to control motor-vehicle air pollution.","start":111.234,"stop":121.689,"duration":10.45},{"text":"Two of the Courts below, the Ninth and Fourth Circuits, decided the case on statutory grounds, holding EPA’s regulations invalid insofar as they required States to comply with them.","start":121.689,"stop":132.274,"duration":10.59},{"text":"District of Columbia Circuit’s decision is more difficult to summarize.","start":132.274,"stop":135.83,"duration":3.56},{"text":"Basically, it agreed with the EPA that the State as owner of a pollution source -- the highways -- could be required under the Act to reduce pollution, the State, the Court held, could be required to refuse registration to vehicles exceeding Federal pollution standards; but inspection must be done by the Federal Government.","start":135.83,"stop":153.963,"duration":18.13},{"text":"We petitioned in all three cases, raising the issue whether inspection and maintenance could be required.","start":153.963,"stop":158.999,"duration":5.04},{"text":"The Commonwealth of Virginia cross-petitioned in the District of Columbia case, raising the issue of bus lanes and purchases.","start":158.999,"stop":165.734,"duration":6.74},{"text":"In a decision not being reviewed here, the Third Circuit sustained EPA’s transportation-control regulations against both a statutory and a constitutional challenge.","start":165.734,"stop":175.843,"duration":10.11},{"text":"Before I describe the Act and the regulations and focus the issues somewhat, I'd like to talk a little bit more about what particular subject is involved here, which is air pollution, a topic that this Court referred to in Washington versus General Motors as one of the most notorious types of public nuisance in modern experience.","start":175.843,"stop":193.98,"duration":18.14},{"text":"The chief culprit, or one of the chief culprits, is the automobile, spewing vast amounts of assorted poisons into the air and accounting for by weight, by tonnage, nearly half of all air pollution in the country.","start":193.98,"stop":205.988,"duration":12.01},{"text":"Because of incomplete combustion and evaporation, the internal combustion engine produces carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons.","start":205.988,"stop":214.227,"duration":8.24},{"text":"Because of high temperatures, it oxidizes nitrogen in the air.","start":214.227,"stop":219.387,"duration":5.16},{"text":"In the presence of sunlight, several of these pollutants react in complex ways, producing photochemical oxidants, or what is commonly called smog.","start":219.387,"stop":227.39,"duration":8},{"text":"The result is thousands of deaths yearly, millions of days of illness and billions of dollars in health costs and property damage throughout the United States.","start":227.39,"stop":237.918,"duration":10.53},{"text":"One more fact, and I think this is very important to our case, air pollution travels, it moves.","start":237.918,"stop":243.186,"duration":5.27},{"text":"It does not respect State boundaries, it does not stay located in one place.","start":243.186,"stop":246.472,"duration":3.29},{"text":"The Court may have seen an article -- I don't know the truth of it, but it illustrates my point -- in last month’s New York Times where it was reported that the vineyards in western New York were being destroyed by air pollution from automobiles in Gary, Indiana.","start":246.472,"stop":260.055,"duration":13.58},{"text":"I think that's as vivid an illustration as possible; whether it is true or not, I don't know.","start":260.055,"stop":264.955,"duration":4.9},{"text":"One other fact, in Section 101 of the Act that is in issue here, Congress found that the predominant part of the nation’s population -- this is the very first finding in the Act -- is located in the rapidly expanding metropolitan areas of the country, which generally cross State borders or are very near State borders.","start":264.955,"stop":282.811,"duration":17.86},{"text":"Now, I don't think I exaggerate, before I talk about the Act, to say that when Congress legislated in the Clean Air Act, it was doing so and acting for many of the very reasons that the founders met in Philadelphia in 1877 and established the Constitution of the United States.","start":282.811,"stop":300.231,"duration":17.42},{"text":"Let me be explicit.","start":300.231,"stop":301.87,"duration":1.64},{"text":"One of the framers’ main objectives was to create a national system of government whereby one State could not pursue its own selfish interests to the injury and detriment of its sister states and the citizens of its sister states.","start":301.87,"stop":315.372,"duration":13.5},{"text":"I think you all recall one of the most famous statements about why the Constitution met was made by Madison.","start":315.372,"stop":320.807,"duration":5.44},{"text":"He likened New Jersey, sitting between Philadelphia and New York, as a keg tapped at both ends; or North Carolina, sitting between South Carolina and Virginia, as a patient bleeding from both arms.","start":320.807,"stop":332.224,"duration":11.42},{"text":"My point is that in arguing here against national action, because of compulsion on the States, the respondents have to confront the Commerce Clause at its very core.","start":332.224,"stop":343.91,"duration":11.69},{"text":"The air is a national resource; air pollution travels and as I hope to demonstrate in this argument, it is no part of our federalism that the health, the welfare and the property of the citizens of one state have to suffer because surrounding states refuse to take action to combat air pollution stemming from the use of their highways.","start":343.91,"stop":367.478,"duration":23.57},{"text":"Now, in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, Congress recognized that control of air pollution was the primary responsibility of the States.","start":367.478,"stop":376.029,"duration":8.55},{"text":"But strong national action was demanded.","start":376.029,"stop":378.613,"duration":2.58},{"text":"Previous efforts, federal efforts, to combat the mounting crisis had failed.","start":378.613,"stop":384.866,"duration":6.25},{"text":"The history as recounted in the Court’s opinion in Train versus NRDC, suffice it to say here that despite offers of technical and financial assistance to the States, the States had made little progress in meeting their responsibility.","start":384.866,"stop":402.541,"duration":17.68},{"text":"The 1970 Amendments, if I can describe them quickly -- the Court had two cases last term dealing with the Clean Air Act, and I will be rather brief in the description -- in the 1970 Amendments, the EPA Administrator was required to set air-quality standards at a level that protects against the adverse effects on health and welfare.","start":402.541,"stop":426.12,"duration":23.58},{"text":"Section 110 of the Act sets forth the process for establishing State programs to achieve and maintain these air-quality standards.","start":426.12,"stop":435.435,"duration":9.31},{"text":"Now, exactly how air pollution was to be controlled within a State was left initially to the State itself.","start":435.435,"stop":443.879,"duration":8.44},{"text":"The State was to submit a plan to EPA, which EPA was required to accept if the plan met the broad outline set forth in Section 110 of the Act.","start":443.879,"stop":454.845,"duration":10.97},{"text":"Two of those requirements set forth in 110 are that the State plan contained, where necessary, transportation controls and an inspection and maintenance program.","start":454.845,"stop":464.63,"duration":9.78},{"text":"If the State plan was deficient, EPA would issue a substitute, at least for those parts of the State plan that were deficient.","start":464.63,"stop":472.32,"duration":7.69},{"text":"Although the State plans were due by January of 1972, EPA gave an extension to all the States where transportation controls would be required to meet ambient air-quality standards.","start":472.32,"stop":481.983,"duration":9.66},{"text":"It did this because EPA realized, just like everyone else did, that we had very little experience with transportation controls.","start":481.983,"stop":489.256,"duration":7.27},{"text":"As a matter of fact, that was why we had a problem; however, a Federal Court of Appeals sitting at the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Act did not permit this delay and ordered that the extension of time be rescinded, and EPA complied.","start":489.256,"stop":504.988,"duration":15.73},{"text":"By late 1973, the process of formulating State plans had been completed.","start":504.988,"stop":510.11,"duration":5.12},{"text":"Some of EPA’s final regulations, which in many instances, I might add, reflected State choices -- and by that, I mean reflected the choices of the States when they submitted proposals or proposed plans.","start":510.11,"stop":522.041,"duration":11.93},{"text":"Imposed duties on the States with respect to State-owned highways and required the establishment of an emission inspection and maintenance program for vehicles registered by the State.","start":522.041,"stop":533.976,"duration":11.93},{"text":"Now, respondents' statutory argument in this case is that the 1970 Amendments do not allow compulsion on a State to act to reduce motor-vehicle air pollution; in other words, to put it bluntly, a State can never be in violation of an implementation plan designed to meet air-quality standards.","start":533.976,"stop":552.209,"duration":18.23}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, your argument doesn't quite go that far, does it?","start":552.209,"stop":555.03,"duration":2.82}]},{"speakerName":"Randolph","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that's the problem with it.","start":555.03,"stop":556.252,"duration":1.22}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"I mean, don’t they concede that a State can be in violation insofar as municipally owned incinerators or...","start":556.252,"stop":563.319,"duration":7.07}]},{"speakerName":"Randolph","textObjs":[{"text":"That was the point I was about to

that.","start":570.078,"stop":570.924,"duration":0.85}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Therefore, they do not make the broad argument that you just

argument.","start":574.454,"stop":577.495,"duration":3.04},{"text":"A State can be a violator, and I would say the respondents admit it can.","start":577.495,"stop":583.044,"duration":5.55},{"text":"The question then is whether a State, by owning the highways, can be a source of pollution, an owner of a source of pollution which has to comply, like anyone else, with the Clean Air Act’s requirements.","start":583.044,"stop":597.846,"duration":14.8},{"text":"Certainly if the State owns a municipal incinerator, it is clear it is a source of pollution, and it has to comply.","start":597.846,"stop":606.53,"duration":8.68},{"text":"I think that is their position, and the EPA’s position, I think, is clearly set out in our brief and I think it is fundamental to our argument.","start":606.53,"stop":613.994,"duration":7.46},{"text":"The EPA Administrator determined early on before any constitutional issue was raised -- this was purely a matter dealing with statute, dealing with legislative histories, the judgment by Administrator, and I don't think it is open to reasonable doubt -- that the States, by owning the highways, own a pollution source and can be required to take action, just like a private source owner can.","start":613.994,"stop":634.36,"duration":20.37}]},{"speakerName":"Potter
