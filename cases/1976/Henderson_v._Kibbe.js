and may it please the Court.","start":44.947,"stop":48.073,"duration":3.13},{"text":"The question presented by this case is whether a State Court criminal conviction should be set aside as fundamentally unfair, because the Trial Judge did not explain the issue of causation to the jury.","start":48.073,"stop":61.646,"duration":13.57},{"text":"The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit answered this question in the affirmative “on the limited and singular facts of this case”.","start":61.646,"stop":70.882,"duration":9.24},{"text":"The court held that in this case the jury may not have been aware that they had to decide the issue of causation and alternatively that if the jury was aware of this element the instruction was not detailed enough.","start":70.882,"stop":84.504,"duration":13.62},{"text":"Petitioner believes that the decision below is erroneous.","start":84.504,"stop":88.374,"duration":3.87},{"text":"First, because the issue of causation was focused for the jury throughout the trial by the prosecution and by both defense lawyers.","start":88.374,"stop":96.755,"duration":8.38},{"text":"Second, because the record controverts respondent’s assumption that it would have been to his advantage to if had a detailed instruction on the issue of causation, and third, because the ultimate question that was decided by the court below and upon which its decision rests to wit whether the jury instruction was adequate was essentially a question of state law and not a matter for habeas corpus review.","start":96.755,"stop":123.046,"duration":26.29},{"text":"Respondent and his codefendant were convicted of the crime of murder in the second degree under a section of the New York Penal Law,

the evening respondent Kibbe and his codefendant Roy Krall met a man named George Stafford in a bar in Rochester, New York.","start":165.496,"stop":176.181,"duration":10.69},{"text":"At that point, Stafford had already been refused service in the bar, because he had had so much to drink.","start":176.181,"stop":181.826,"duration":5.64},{"text":"Kibbe and Krall agreed to give Stafford a ride home when Stafford indicated that he was afraid to drive his own car.","start":181.826,"stop":189.937,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The defendants later admitted that they had already formed the intent to take the money, which Stafford had been flashing in the bar.","start":189.937,"stop":195.796,"duration":5.86},{"text":"First however, the three men went to two more bars, one of which refused Stafford service again.","start":195.796,"stop":203.325,"duration":7.53},{"text":"Kibbe and Krall then drove Stafford to a rural area outside of Rochester.","start":203.325,"stop":207.113,"duration":3.79},{"text":"They took his money.","start":207.113,"stop":208.587,"duration":1.47},{"text":"According to the defendants, Stafford lowered his trousers and took off his boots to show them that he had no more money.","start":208.587,"stop":216.479,"duration":7.89},{"text":"Stafford’s girlfriend testified at the trial however that in fact because of an injury to his leg he could not remove his right boot.","start":216.479,"stop":224.041,"duration":7.56},{"text":"However, Stafford’s state of undress is accounted for.","start":224.041,"stop":228.439,"duration":4.4},{"text":"The fact is that he was left essentially undressed at the side of a two-lane unlit road, which was banked on both sides by snow.","start":228.439,"stop":239.049,"duration":10.61},{"text":"The record establishes that it was four degrees outside.","start":239.049,"stop":241.426,"duration":2.38},{"text":"Stafford was not wearing his jacket or his boots.","start":241.426,"stop":244.766,"duration":3.34},{"text":"These were handed to him by respondent Kibbe with the advice that Stafford get inside so that he not freeze to death.","start":244.766,"stop":255.234,"duration":10.47},{"text":"One essential fact remains, and that is that at this point Kibbe and Krall drove off leaving Stafford on the side of the road having fallen into a snow bank, and they took with them his eyeglasses.","start":255.234,"stop":266.463,"duration":11.23},{"text":"Now there is no

statement he later gave to the police said that they left Stafford 75 feet away from this gas station.","start":286.952,"stop":294.231,"duration":7.28},{"text":"The prosecution introduced physical

acknowledged that they knew this.","start":303.487,"stop":308.234,"duration":4.75},{"text":"So, when they told him to get inside some place, and they knew that the gas station was on the other side of the road, they realized he had to cross the road.","start":308.234,"stop":315.231,"duration":7},{"text":"Moreover, Krall acknowledged, at least Krall acknowledged that there was in fact at that time

here.","start":365.504,"stop":372.866,"duration":7.36}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"But I was wondering about how much traffic there was on?","start":372.866,"stop":375.036,"duration":2.17}]},{"speakerName":"Lillian Zeisel Cohen","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, there is testimony on traffic, although respondent disputes the amount of traffic.","start":375.036,"stop":381.476,"duration":6.44},{"text":"As I say, Krall himself admitted that there were cars going in both directions at the time that they abandoned Stafford.","start":381.476,"stop":387.953,"duration":6.48},{"text":"At the time of the accident, which took place a half an hour later at least three cars converged on that point.","start":387.953,"stop":392.763,"duration":4.81},{"text":"And as we point out in the reply brief, the driver of the car which ultimately struck Stafford indicated that passersby as they came

responsibility for what happened to the driver of the truck, Michael Blake.","start":532.745,"stop":543.635,"duration":10.89},{"text":"They did this in several ways.","start":543.635,"stop":545.478,"duration":1.84},{"text":"First, they cross-examined Michael Blake extensively about the circumstances under which he struck Stafford.","start":545.478,"stop":551.695,"duration":6.22},{"text":"They cross-examined the medical examiner to show that there was no chance that death was caused by anything except the impact from

actually said to the jury that if anyone in this case was depraved, and if anyone in this case caused Stafford’s death, it was Michael Blake, and interestingly, the officials had taken no action against him for his wrongdoing.","start":564.85,"stop":579.338,"duration":14.49},{"text":"At the same time they both pointedly disputed the forseeability of Stafford’s

death.","start":615.544,"stop":618.593,"duration":3.05},{"text":"Now, in short as the court below itself found the issue of causation was constantly being placed before the jury by the defense, and I might add the prosecutor responded in kind arguing that even though these defendants were not the sole cause of death, even though they were not the immediate cause of death, nevertheless they were responsible, and they were approximate cause of death.","start":618.593,"stop":640.983,"duration":22.39},{"text":"Now, not withstanding, the fact that the theory of the defense was to deny that Kibbe

that the issue of causation had been focused for the jury.","start":688.119,"stop":692.85,"duration":4.73},{"text":"The second is that they realized that under New York Law, an explicit charge on causation would have effectively deprived them of the opportunity of arguing to the jury that it was the negligence of the driver that was to blame, and in that way attempting to sway the jury away from the responsibility of the defendants.","start":692.85,"stop":712.122,"duration":19.27}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

glasses.","start":735.543,"stop":743.032,"duration":7.49},{"text":"This was hammered out constantly, and that was hammered up by the prosecution to show responsibility, and it was disputed by the defense who said it simply was not foreseeable.","start":743.032,"stop":756.229,"duration":13.2},{"text":"With respect to counsel’s likely satisfaction that the issue was properly before the jury, I point to the statement by counsel for Krall who even before the charge to the jury said in summation, “You probably have the accounts well in mind since we have all gone over it.”","start":756.229,"stop":772.631,"duration":16.4},{"text":"Now at that point, in the trial, the indictment had been read to the jury by Kibbe’s counsel in

the indictment to the jury, and the Judge at the beginning of his charge read the indictment to the jury.","start":788.18,"stop":795.457,"duration":7.28},{"text":"The Judge also read the provisions of the statute after emphasizing that every element of the crime had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and ultimately while the jury was deliberating the indictment was given to them so that they could track the charges.","start":795.457,"stop":809.274,"duration":13.82},{"text":"Despite these repeated statements of the law to the jury and despite the fact the causation was argued so graphically to the jury by both defense counsels, the court below questioned whether the jury was aware that it had to decide the issue of causation.","start":809.274,"stop":825.948,"duration":16.67},{"text":"This conclusion in my opinion cannot be sustained on the record in this case, and we believe that the explanation for the court's
