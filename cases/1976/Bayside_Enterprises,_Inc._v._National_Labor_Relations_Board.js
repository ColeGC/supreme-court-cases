Inc.","start":77.074,"stop":81.837,"duration":4.76},{"text":"Bayside is a poultry industry located in Waldo County up in Belfast, near Belfast, Maine.","start":81.837,"stop":89.535,"duration":7.7},{"text":"The contention of Bayside and this involves six feed drivers, the drive poultry trucks, which are these specialized trucks that deliver grain.","start":89.535,"stop":100.807,"duration":11.27},{"text":"These poultry drivers are exempt from the National Labor Relation Act as agricultural labors.","start":100.807,"stop":108.202,"duration":7.39},{"text":"The National Labor Relations Act and Agricultural Labors makes reference to -- because of an act of Congress in 1946 and the Appropriations Act it is referenced to 3F of the Fair Labor Standards Act.","start":108.202,"stop":126.995,"duration":18.79},{"text":"In my brief, I have set out 3F and all of this discussion today is on page three and all of this discussion today revolves around 3F.","start":126.995,"stop":139.168,"duration":12.17},{"text":"Now, this 3F has been discussed many times before this court, particularly in Farmers Agricultural Company and what it says is that to be exempt, you have to either fall into a primary classification or a secondary classification of farming.","start":139.168,"stop":159.334,"duration":20.17},{"text":"Now, in the poultry industry, it makes specific reference to the question of raising poultry.","start":159.334,"stop":165.619,"duration":6.28},{"text":"So, when I talk about the primary definition of agriculture here, I will be talking about raising poultry.","start":165.619,"stop":172.244,"duration":6.63},{"text":"The secondary definition talks about incidental tour conjunction with farming when performed by a farmer or on a farm.","start":172.244,"stop":180.676,"duration":8.43},{"text":"So, I will have to be talking about farmer or on a farm an incidental conjunction with farming.","start":180.676,"stop":185.858,"duration":5.18},{"text":"There is also a phrase preparation from market, which is in the 3F which also has some consideration and some courts have hints to exemption on that point.","start":185.858,"stop":199.295,"duration":13.44},{"text":"The outline of my argument is that Bayside itself being a vertically integrated poultry organization comes within the definition of primary agriculture because it is a producer and that the feed delivery drivers are within the secondary definition of agriculture because of their work being incidental to in conjunction with farming.","start":199.295,"stop":222.695,"duration":23.4},{"text":"I will also talk in terms of a possible alternative argument that the feed poultry drivers are on the farm within the meaning of that, those words.","start":222.695,"stop":233.565,"duration":10.87},{"text":"To summarize the arguments, the choice here, the feed poultry drivers are either one, directly in farming.","start":233.565,"stop":241.465,"duration":7.9},{"text":"Two, incidentally to connected with farming or three, not connected with farming at all.","start":241.465,"stop":246.699,"duration":5.23},{"text":"I will be talking about the first two choices and I will leave the third choice to my opponent.","start":246.699,"stop":253.061,"duration":6.36},{"text":"Briefly, I will like to talk to you about the facts of the case and just a little bit of sketch about the poultry industry.","start":253.061,"stop":260.471,"duration":7.41},{"text":"Bayside is a singular enterprise.","start":260.471,"stop":263.177,"duration":2.71},{"text":"It produces and markets poultry up in Waldo County Maine.","start":263.177,"stop":268.716,"duration":5.54},{"text":"Although, there are two Corporations, there is a central management that makes all the decisions of the poultry company from one what is called from the cradle to the grave to raising poultry.","start":268.716,"stop":280.485,"duration":11.77},{"text":"The company is made up of several components.","start":280.485,"stop":283.357,"duration":2.87},{"text":"There is, besides the main office, there is a breeding hatchery with the several farms connected to it, a commercial hatchery with eleven farms connected to it, there is a feed mill, there is the feed delivery operation which we are talking about here.","start":283.357,"stop":298.371,"duration":15.01},{"text":"There is a 119 contract farms which I will go into the contract later.","start":298.371,"stop":303.555,"duration":5.18},{"text":"Bayside itself owns seven farms.","start":303.555,"stop":306.396,"duration":2.84},{"text":"There is a processing plant with trucks to pick up the poultry from the farms and deliver it to the processing plant.","start":306.396,"stop":314.523,"duration":8.13},{"text":"Briefly, this is how it works out.","start":314.523,"stop":317.377,"duration":2.85},{"text":"The company has a Geneticist who makes the decisions as to what type of poultry they should grow.","start":317.377,"stop":326.1,"duration":8.72},{"text":"They have been very successful because they have reduced the time it takes to grow from a broiler from 16 weeks to about 9 weeks and they make such decisions as how to grow a chicken with white meat or how to speed up its maturity and things like that.","start":326.1,"stop":343.288,"duration":17.19},{"text":"You see, it’s a very valuable, integrate part of the business of raising chickens.","start":343.288,"stop":348.18,"duration":4.89},{"text":"Well, after they decide that, they may breed flocks to produce the eggs.","start":348.18,"stop":352.93,"duration":4.75},{"text":"Then, they take the eggs and they hatch them till they are one day old.","start":352.93,"stop":357.988,"duration":5.06},{"text":"Then, they take and they place these one day old broilers on these contract farms.","start":357.988,"stop":364.517,"duration":6.53},{"text":"While they are doing that, they have a feed mill and they are making feed for the broilers which changes according to age.","start":364.517,"stop":371.627,"duration":7.11},{"text":"They change it at least four times and if the flock is unhealthy, then they change it more times than that.","start":371.627,"stop":377.868,"duration":6.24},{"text":"Then they have this feed delivery system which I will talk about later that delivers the feed from the feed mill to the processing plant, no, from the feed from the feed mill to the contract farms.","start":377.868,"stop":391.176,"duration":13.31},{"text":"Then, while the poultry is on the farms and the poultry stays on the farm for about nine weeks when they take it off.","start":391.176,"stop":399.276,"duration":8.1},{"text":"They have these feed crews that go on to the farm and they vaccinate, blood test, debeak and all the things that you do to keep up the health and well-being of the poultry.","start":399.276,"stop":411.28,"duration":12},{"text":"After the flock leaves, the farm crews go and they clean the poultry farms of the contract farmers and while this is all going on, this is all being directed by a Broiler Department Manager who directs the Supervisors, the forest farm Supervisors that check the farmers and then there is a farm crew.","start":411.28,"stop":431.552,"duration":20.27},{"text":"He decides what age to market the flock and what sizes of the birds are marketable and then he sends out the crew from the processing plant who catches, coops and loads the birds for transport to the processing plant.","start":431.552,"stop":446.717,"duration":15.16},{"text":"The processing plant processes the birds and markets them to a dealer or a chain or some intermediate third party.","start":446.717,"stop":454.915,"duration":8.2},{"text":"Now, all of this that Bayside is doing is typical of what's going on in the poultry industry.","start":454.915,"stop":460.57,"duration":5.65},{"text":"It’s a typically integrated broiler producing marketing firm.","start":460.57,"stop":464.265,"duration":3.69}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E. Burger","textObjs":[{"text":"When you say this typical of this particular industry, do you -- would you distinguish that from large commercial farming operations generally, as they have changed from the old traditional patterns?","start":464.265,"stop":476.187,"duration":11.92}]},{"speakerName":"Alan J. Levenson","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I am going to be very cautious here about talking about any other industry than poultry.","start":476.187,"stop":481.309,"duration":5.12},{"text":"I can talk about the poultry industry that this is all of the evidence and the marketing reports that are filed with this court talks about poultry and they say that 95% of the chickens that are eaten today are coming from a vertically integrated producer of one kind or another and that’s what I say, I cant talk about cattle or anything else.","start":481.309,"stop":504.883,"duration":23.57},{"text":"Now, the other point I would like to make is that nearly all the broilers today are produced by integrated broiler firms and that this development has gradually arisen.","start":504.883,"stop":520.179,"duration":15.3},{"text":"Now, what used to happen in the past, there used to be individual processing plants and individual feed mills and then there was individual delivery systems and as the farm and the poultry industry gradually evolved, each of these firms developed so that gradually, it became a concentration so that each one of these took in all the attributes of one firm.","start":520.179,"stop":547.373,"duration":27.19},{"text":"What I am saying is that basically, there are four elements; I mean big substantial components of -- this type of vertically integrated.","start":547.373,"stop":555.321,"duration":7.95},{"text":"They are the feed mill, the processing plant, the hatcheries and the producers, the contract growers.","start":555.321,"stop":565.289,"duration":9.97},{"text":"Gradually, they all came together under one management and basically, they are all interdependent on each other and the management is like a bundle of sticks and they are all held together and the thing that holds them together is the management that’s making all the decisions as to what's going to happen.","start":565.289,"stop":582.92,"duration":17.63},{"text":"Well, as a result of this development, the fact that is important to me it seems that there really is no significant live broiler market today.","start":582.92,"stop":593.137,"duration":10.22},{"text":"You can’t go and raise chickens and sell them to anyone.","start":593.137,"stop":595.197,"duration":2.06},{"text":"All of these farmers are connected to some type of broiler organization.","start":595.197,"stop":601.613,"duration":6.42},{"text":"Now that becomes critical when I talk about the part of the processing plant to this whole operation.","start":601.613,"stop":607.679,"duration":6.07},{"text":"They are all marketed as ready to cook broilers by an integrated company.","start":607.679,"stop":612.332,"duration":4.65},{"text":"Now, the argument of Bayside is because of this type of operation, that it is Bayside and vertically integrated operators like Bayside, that are in effect the operators, the producers within the contemplation of the statutes, they are the farmers and basically that argument breaks down into four elements.","start":612.332,"stop":632.102,"duration":19.77},{"text":"First of all, the company is the one that initiates the production process, it is the one that invests in both production and marketing of poultry, it is the one that controls all the marketing, production and poultrying and fourthly, it is the one that actively participates in the management of the flock and the poultry husbandry.","start":632.102,"stop":653.521,"duration":21.42},{"text":"Now, this position is sustained by two major cases in the poultry industry and one is Tyson poultrying and the other is NLRB versus Strain.","start":653.521,"stop":663.749,"duration":10.23},{"text":"Now, there are other cases that sustain my position, but the discussion, the rational is set out in those two cases.","start":663.749,"stop":673.795,"duration":10.05},{"text":"Tyson was an egg producer and Strain was a chicken, poultry farmer like this one.","start":673.795,"stop":680.444,"duration":6.65},{"text":"The contrary argument is that it is the contract farmers that are raising the poultry and that they should be considered the farmer and that has a ring of simplicity in it because the chickens are on the contract farms.","start":680.444,"stop":694.466,"duration":14.02},{"text":"When the Court in Strain took this under consideration, they framed the issue this way, does the fact that the integrator uses independent growers, destroy its claim to having raise the bird or is the integrator more akin to the purchaser of the bird.","start":694.466,"stop":712.313,"duration":17.85},{"text":"The court then reviewed the same factual type of situation that I have described and said, “Even though the raising of the birds was shared with independent growers, Strain’s activity were more nearly that of one engaged in raising poultry than a purchaser or a jobber.”","start":712.313,"stop":731.102,"duration":18.79},{"text":"When Tyson took up the same situation, it said, “We are here concerned with the single completely integrated farming operation.”","start":731.102,"stop":738.365,"duration":7.26},{"text":"Tyson is the farmers and they are the ones who initiated the farming operations here in (Inaudible) without the appellees that is Tyson, the independent growers arguably would never have undertaken the initial and continuing cost of acquiring the birds and producing the eggs, the contract growers merely aid the appellees who are the farmers.","start":738.365,"stop":758.478,"duration":20.11},{"text":"So, the issue drawn is, is a company like Bayside, a middle man, is it somebody that is kind of buying the chickens from the farms, is it somebody that is a purchaser, a distributor or something like that and the argument has been made many times and the rational and Strain really talked about are Rosebush case, they said, no, it was not -- I mean the Rosebush case that they decided was more of a middle man because they were buying it, they were only buying things that were marketable or a purchaser or something like that.","start":758.478,"stop":797.127,"duration":38.65},{"text":"Well, all of this gets down to the core of the question or what some people feel the core is, the risk of loss.","start":797.127,"stop":805.478,"duration":8.35},{"text":"Who is taking the risk of this type of operation between the farmers on the farm and the vertically integrator that is supervising all of this?","start":805.478,"stop":814.692,"duration":9.21},{"text":"Well, that involves the contract itself; the contract guarantees the farmer a specific rate per week depending upon the size of the house.","start":814.692,"stop":826.188,"duration":11.5},{"text":"He then gives it an additional bonus depending on his production as compared to other Bayside contract farmers.","start":826.188,"stop":833.207,"duration":7.02},{"text":"Bear in mind that Bayside owns the flocks at all time and that the chickens are a perishable commodity.","start":833.207,"stop":841.499,"duration":8.29},{"text":"The point that I would like to make, is that the payments to the grower have no relationship to the market price that Bayside eventually gets from it.","start":841.499,"stop":851.887,"duration":10.39},{"text":"Whatever happens, the farmer gets a certain guarantee payment and then he does participate in a bonus depending on anybody else.","start":851.887,"stop":862.387,"duration":10.5},{"text":"Now, this can work out several ways because bear in mind there are two markets involved, one is the feed market, the grain that you have to buy and the other is the large market, I mean the process market that you have to sell.","start":862.387,"stop":875.823,"duration":13.44},{"text":"So, it is quite conceivable that the man, who is the farmer can receive a profit from his operation and then that same chicken can go out, be processed and sent to market and the vertically integrator can lose money and the reason for that is because the cost of grain can be more expensive than the cost of selling the bird.","start":875.823,"stop":896.577,"duration":20.75},{"text":"It seems to me that some what critical.","start":896.577,"stop":898.844,"duration":2.27},{"text":"On the discussion of this at the trial level, we talked a lot about who has the risk of loss and I was trying to prove that we had all the risk of loss, but there is no question it seems to me that some of the risk of loss, are if a man has -- well, if a man is employing other people, he would invest some money, so he would make less money then he would otherwise, but there is a case on this that has been pointed out to me about ducks.","start":898.844,"stop":926.87,"duration":28.03},{"text":"In the Tax Court, and it is called Maple Leaf Farms 64, 438, Tax Court What they say there is that the risk is really unequal, in other words, a man who is a farmer, in this type of situation with a contract can really gage the kind of loss he is going to -- if there is going to be a loss, he is kind of gage what kind of money he is going to get in advance.","start":926.87,"stop":951.075,"duration":24.21},{"text":"While, the person who is the vertically integrator has to deal with markets that are unveiled that you never know what you going to get and that kind of is a critical factor in talking about who is really running the farm and who is not running the farm.","start":951.075,"stop":966.975,"duration":15.9}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"The Tax Court decision, that is not in your
