Kalmus","textObjs":[{"text":"Your honor there was only one objection taken in the course of the prosecutor McDaniel’s argument and that was rather far along in it and at that point defense counsel stood up and objected to one of McDaniel’s statements that he wished the defendant had been maimed, that his head has been blown off or he had been cut his own throat of which there were a good many such statements.","start":187.668,"stop":214.94,"duration":27.27},{"text":"That was the only objection taken the trial judge simply without any discussion said overruled, proceed Mr. McDaniel.","start":214.94,"stop":231.498,"duration":16.56},{"text":"Returning to the question of the evidence as it stood at the close of the defense case, there were only three significant items of evidence supporting the prosecutions claimed that Mr. Darden had committed this robbery murder of the man name Terman.","start":231.498,"stop":253.795,"duration":22.3},{"text":"Two of the items of evidence were identifications, those by Mrs. Terman who was working in the furniture store when the assailant came in and that of a young man name Mr. Arnold the 16 year old boy who kind of happened in the backdoor while the crime was in progress and was also shot and injured by the assailant.","start":253.795,"stop":280.021,"duration":26.23},{"text":"Both of those identifications were shortly challenged at the trial, and both of them I think would put insubstantial doubt.","start":280.021,"stop":290.33,"duration":10.31},{"text":"That subject was one in which we dealt at lenghts in our brief because at the time we submitted our brief the identification issue was also one upon which the court had granted cert, I may recall that in early January, so it was limited to the first question presented that at the prosecutorial misconduct.","start":290.33,"stop":310.937,"duration":20.61},{"text":"One can judge Mrs. Terman’s identification of the assailant in a few fashions.","start":310.937,"stop":318,"duration":7.06},{"text":"Number one, she gave a description to the Deputy Sherif right after the crime that bore no resemblance to the petitioner.","start":318,"stop":325.914,"duration":7.91},{"text":"Number two, she described the assailant is wearing clothing that different markedly from that what petitioner was described is wearing by somebody who had seen him at the seen him scene of his automobile accident which according to the prosecution happened as he was fleeing the crime.","start":325.914,"stop":344.166,"duration":18.25},{"text":"Number three, Mrs. Terman never was asked to or in fact identify the petitioner of any kind of a formal line up be it photo or live.","start":344.166,"stop":354.404,"duration":10.24},{"text":"Number four, her only pretrial identification in this came into evidence on the direct testimony at trial occurred at the preliminary hearing when the petitioner was the only black man in the court room seated with counsel of the defense table and was -- Mrs. Thurman was asked to point him out and she did and one can judge the reliability of that identification by what she said when she was asked by the court in effect are you sure?","start":354.404,"stop":384.275,"duration":29.87},{"text":"And she responded why when I walked into the court room and was seated in the back and I saw him from the rear I knew this was the man who had killed my husband, this was somebody she had seen for a few minutes during the robbery and she claimed of knowing him since she walked in from his back.","start":384.275,"stop":401.173,"duration":16.9},{"text":"Mr. Arnold’s identification, this is the 16 year old boy, he was subject to substantial infirmity as well.","start":401.173,"stop":409.616,"duration":8.44},{"text":"First of all he testified a trial that he had seen the assailant for only 20 to 25 seconds and in part of that time he was looking down at Mr. Terman who had been shot and laid in the doorway and was trying to give aid to him.","start":409.616,"stop":425.097,"duration":15.48},{"text":"Number two, he said his mind went blank during that 20-25 seconds.","start":425.097,"stop":429.472,"duration":4.38},{"text":"Number three, he was never, the subject of a lying up be it photo or otherwise.","start":429.472,"stop":435.99,"duration":6.52},{"text":"He did while in the hospital identify the petitioner’s photo in the group shown to him but his testimony was at the trial that four or the six photos shown to him which looked nothing like the petitioner and that the one that he did see and identify lo and behold petitioner’s name across it Darden across the chest and the date 09/09/73 of the date of the crime, and Mr. Arnold testified that he had read about the crime before he was asked to make this photo identification.","start":435.99,"stop":473.727,"duration":37.74},{"text":"The final piece of evidence that the state had that amounted to anything was a gun and the gun was indisputably of the caliber used in the crime a 38 and it was found some 40 feet from the highway and a roughly the same distance from the place at which the petitioner had his automobile accident, no dispute that he had the accident a few miles from the scene of the crime at around the same time and that gun was found a day later, not very far from the automobile accident and not very far from the highway and indeed there was no dispute that anybody might tossed it out passing the car.","start":473.727,"stop":514.227,"duration":40.5},{"text":"So, that was the states case as the case went to the jury.","start":514.227,"stop":518.553,"duration":4.33},{"text":"On the defendant side the defendant had taken the stand in his own behalf, he was the only witness in his own behalf.","start":518.553,"stop":523.857,"duration":5.3},{"text":"He had told what I believe the record demonstrates to be a coherent and plausible story not in consistent with the prosecution story but to the identifications, not in itself inherently and implausible story and that was the case for the defense.","start":523.857,"stop":547.635,"duration":23.78},{"text":"So, in sum the case as it reached the summations stage was a close one and we think the prosecution summation itself impart demonstrates that.","start":547.635,"stop":560.403,"duration":12.77},{"text":"I think one can ask rhetorical question quite appropriately, would any sensible prosecutor have carried on when McDaniel did hear if he though he had an easy winner.","start":560.403,"stop":571.853,"duration":11.45},{"text":"Is this the kind of thing that any experience and this was not experience prosecutor would do, if he was comfortable with his case and we think the answer to that is an obvious one and did McDaniel’s conduct itself demonstrates that he thought his case was shaky one.","start":571.853,"stop":590.027,"duration":18.17},{"text":"As to the merits of the summation the demerits of the summation, the character of the McDaniel’s conduct I do not think the one need past beyond the brief of the respondent and the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida to know how it should be characterized.","start":590.027,"stop":607.706,"duration":17.68},{"text":"The respondent’s brief what is it called the summation by McDaniel here.","start":607.706,"stop":612.486,"duration":4.78},{"text":"Utterly irrelevant is one phrase, without rational relationships that question of quilt or innocence is a second, inflammatory and irrelevancy state says, improper appeals to the jury’s emotion.","start":612.486,"stop":626.459,"duration":13.97},{"text":"Finally, the ravings of the prosecution that is the state’s characterization, not ours of the summation by McDaniel.","start":626.459,"stop":638.204,"duration":11.75},{"text":"I think if you read the state’s brief, it is only real argument in the defense of the summation depart from the procedural points that has raised is that the summation was so bad that no sensible juries would have paid any attention to anything that McDaniel said.","start":638.204,"stop":655.947,"duration":17.74},{"text":"Now the majority in the Supreme Court of Florida this was the conviction and death sentence were affirmed by 5-to-2.","start":655.947,"stop":663.118,"duration":7.17},{"text":"The majority opinion also recognized we think that the closing argument was not improper one.","start":663.118,"stop":669.615,"duration":6.5},{"text":"What have they said?","start":669.615,"stop":671.273,"duration":1.66},{"text":"They said although the prosecutions remarks under ordinary circumstances would constitute a violation of the code of professional responsibility.","start":671.273,"stop":679.623,"duration":8.35},{"text":"In this particular case they amounted to harmless era when the totality of the record is considered.","start":679.623,"stop":685.888,"duration":6.26},{"text":"Again the language used by the prosecution Justice Boyd wrote for the majority would possibly have been reversal error if it had been used regarding a less heinous set of crimes.","start":685.888,"stop":699.559,"duration":13.67},{"text":"Illogically however the Supreme Court of Florida said
