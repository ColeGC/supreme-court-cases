B. Fortner, a successful Louisville realtor.","start":167.811,"stop":176.397,"duration":8.59},{"text":"The defendants are US Steel, which through its Homes Division sold prefabricated houses and it is wholly owned finance subsidiary, US Steel Homes Credit Corporation which confined its financing services to promoting the sale of Homes Division Houses.","start":176.397,"stop":195.003,"duration":18.61},{"text":"By written agreements executed in the first instance in October 1960, and again in August 1961, Mr. Fortner negotiated with the credit corporation, certain land loans covering the acquisition and development of two neighboring parcels of land and a subdivision owned by another of Mr. Fortner’s corporations Viroqua (ph) Development.","start":195.003,"stop":221.098,"duration":26.1},{"text":"This financing was conditioned upon the agreement by the plaintiff to buy and construct a Homes Division, prefabricated house on each of the lots unless the underlying loans were repaid.","start":221.098,"stop":234.878,"duration":13.78},{"text":"The amount committed under these loan agreements was 100% of the cost at which Mr. Fortner transferred the lots from one corporation to the other, plus the cost of development of some 150 lots which were involved in the first transaction and which were not fully developed at that time.","start":234.878,"stop":254.127,"duration":19.25},{"text":"Mr. Fortner testified that he would not have purchased the defendant’s houses without this land financing which is the challenged subject in this lawsuit.","start":254.127,"stop":264.082,"duration":9.95},{"text":"Mr. Fortner also testified that only when the defendants had finally accepted his terms during extensive negotiations, did he agree to enter into this arrangement.","start":264.082,"stop":275.994,"duration":11.91},{"text":"Fortner contends both below and here that this land financing, conditioned upon the purchase of the prefabricated houses was a per se time violation in that the loans were allegedly unique, because 100% loans on equally favorable, equally cheap terms were not available at that time from traditional Louisville lending sources.","start":275.994,"stop":300.838,"duration":24.84},{"text":"More specifically, Mr. Fortner and other witnesses testified that to the best of their knowledge, 100% loans were not available from conventional lenders in Louisville at the particular time they entered into these two transactions with the defendants.","start":300.838,"stop":316.753,"duration":15.91},{"text":"But as the Court of Appeals noted, soon after the plaintiff had negotiated its 100% terms with the defendants, conventional Louisville lending agencies did in fact begin to grant 100% land loans.","start":316.753,"stop":331.24,"duration":14.49},{"text":"In fact, it is undisputed on this record that within less than a year of the second loan agreement, in response not only to the alleged terms which the Credit Corporation granted to the plaintiff here, but also in response to 100% loans by other prefabricated house manufacturers, the traditional Louisville lending agencies were indeed making 100% land loans.","start":331.24,"stop":356.354,"duration":25.11},{"text":"We contend that Fortner has failed to make out a prima facie case of the requisite economic power over credit in order to establish a per se time violation.","start":356.354,"stop":367.655,"duration":11.3},{"text":"In holding to the contrary, we respectfully submit that the courts below have failed to follow the mandate laid down by this Court.","start":367.655,"stop":376.438,"duration":8.78},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, on the most recent appeal, held that even though Fortner had failed to prove that other lenders were in anyway prevented from making equally favorable or cheap loans, none the less the requisite economic power over credit could be and was held to be in this case established by solely three elements of proof.","start":376.438,"stop":398.46,"duration":22.02},{"text":"First, that the loans were allegedly cheaper or more favorable than available at that time from other sources in Louisville.","start":398.46,"stop":406.202,"duration":7.74},{"text":"Second, based upon the opinion testimony of Fortner’s construction superintendent that the tied product price, the price of the houses charged by the defendants was allegedly higher than the price for a comparable conventional house, and finally mere acceptance of this tying condition in those circumstances.","start":406.202,"stop":430.545,"duration":24.34},{"text":"I would turn now to what the petitioners believe this Court held was necessary to establish economic power over credit.","start":430.545,"stop":438.769,"duration":8.22}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Flinn, before you do that, is it not correct that there was also at least representing opinion to an additional item approved, namely the fact that there were other times between your credit division and other purchases of Homes?","start":438.769,"stop":456.066,"duration":17.3}]},{"speakerName":"Macdonald Flinn","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe that as correct.","start":456.066,"stop":458.634,"duration":2.57},{"text":"I intended to subsume that holding by the Court in my statement of the third element, customer acceptance.","start":458.634,"stop":464.552,"duration":5.92},{"text":"The plaintiff has contended that uniquely favorable loans were extended by the Credit Corporation to other borrowers.","start":464.552,"stop":472.05,"duration":7.5},{"text":"We urge that there are absolutely no evidences or the records of the terms or conditions on which loans were made by the Credit Corporation to any other borrower.","start":472.05,"stop":481.185,"duration":9.13},{"text":"We contended that there is nothing that shows that loans to any other borrower on land financing were especially unique in the sense, that equally favorable terms were not available from other conventional…","start":481.185,"stop":493.449,"duration":12.26}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Is there not evidence that a certain percentage and I do not remember the figure now of your credit company’s loans did have a tie-in feature with it?","start":493.449,"stop":501.809,"duration":8.36}]},{"speakerName":"Macdonald Flinn","textObjs":[{"text":"The plaintiff has I think taken the evidence out of record.","start":501.809,"stop":504.837,"duration":3.03},{"text":"We have treated this point in some detail in the Appendix and the reason that we have put it in the Appendix to our reply brief Mr. Justice, is because we are prepared to stand on our argument today whether or not other customers acquiesced in tie-in arrangements under uniquely favorable loan terms.","start":504.837,"stop":523.426,"duration":18.59},{"text":"Our argument is as a matter of law, that the result is the same for reasons which I will go into in my argument, but we do take factual issue with the state of the record and have detailed the record in that.","start":523.426,"stop":535.112,"duration":11.69}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Your point, just so I have clear mind, the customer acceptance feature of the proof is the same whether it is this customer or this customer is?","start":535.112,"stop":542.229,"duration":7.12}]},{"speakerName":"Macdonald Flinn","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Justice Stevens, that is my argument today, yes sir.","start":542.229,"stop":548.081,"duration":5.85},{"text":"Unlike a tie-in product which is unique or distinctive and commands a higher price or a premium price thereby yielding an abnormally high profit to the seller, credit or financing by contrasts is the most fungible of all commodities.","start":548.081,"stop":568.053,"duration":19.97},{"text":"$1 is no different than any other dollar and no lender can long command a higher price or more owners or costly terms for selling his credit or his financing services than other lenders are asking.","start":568.053,"stop":582.256,"duration":14.2},{"text":"In recognition to that fact, this Court, both the majority and the dissenting Justices stated that the only thing that can be unique about a loan or financing is that it is offered on cheaper or more favorable terms than other lenders are offering at the particular moment.","start":582.256,"stop":599.341,"duration":17.09},{"text":"Indeed, such cheaper offering of terms is the very crux, the very essence of competition among lenders.","start":599.341,"stop":608.462,"duration":9.12},{"text":"In recognition to that fact and in keeping with that desirable competitive objective, again, both the majority and dissenting Justices of this Court rejected Fortner’s argument that economic power over credit can be established solely by the fact that the terms offered are cheaper or more favorable than available elsewhere.","start":608.462,"stop":631.889,"duration":23.43},{"text":"In fact, both the majority and dissenting Justices recognized that without any economic power over credit, a lender can decide to offer more favorable terms in order to promote the sale of an ancillary or tied product.","start":631.889,"stop":649.385,"duration":17.5},{"text":"Such a lender may simply decide to give up some or all of the profit which other lenders are making on the terms that they ask.","start":649.385,"stop":657.928,"duration":8.54},{"text":"As Justice Black stated for the majority, a seller who lacks economic power in the credit market can lawfully offer advantageous terms on credit as a means of promoting the sale of his tied product, thereby in effect reducing the price of the tied product, engaging in price competition in the tied product market.","start":657.928,"stop":679.503,"duration":21.58},{"text":"In short, this Court concluded that cheaper, more favorable terms for credit neither prove nor disprove the existence of economic power.","start":679.503,"stop":690.517,"duration":11.01},{"text":"They merely pose the decisive question which must then be answered if in fact, the loan terms were cheaper or more favorable than available elsewhere, were they cheaper because the defendants had some unique economic ability, some unique competitive advantage which precluded other lenders from offering equally favorable terms on a profitable basis.","start":690.517,"stop":716.502,"duration":25.98},{"text":"The issue mandated by this Court, therefore, was not whether equally cheap financing was merely unavailable from other lenders at that particular time.","start":716.502,"stop":727.171,"duration":10.67},{"text":"Rather as the majority held, unless other lenders were legally barred from offering 100% loan terms, the issue then is whether in the words of Justice Black, the defendants had a unique economic ability to provide 100% financing at cheap rates because they had some cost advantage or economies of scale in their credit operations, so that other lenders could not profitably lend money on the risks involved.","start":727.171,"stop":756.687,"duration":29.52},{"text":"The Court of Appeals addressed itself to these factual issues.","start":756.687,"stop":761.04,"duration":4.35},{"text":"It correctly concluded that there was no such proof in this trial record.","start":761.04,"stop":765.485,"duration":4.45},{"text":"Many lenders were legally free not subject to any probations upon making 100% land loans.","start":765.485,"stop":772.826,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Similarly, Fortner offered no evidence that the defendants had any cost advantage or economies of scale arising out of their operations in the credit market.","start":772.826,"stop":782.869,"duration":10.04},{"text":"Instead, the record shows affirmatively that the defendants operated at a cost disadvantage and realized a lower rate of profit than conventional lenders did.","start":782.869,"stop":794.135,"duration":11.27},{"text":"In fact, what the courts below found was that conventional lenders were not making 100% loans at the time of these transactions only because they were unwilling to take the risk of lower profits.","start":794.135,"stop":809.324,"duration":15.19},{"text":"Now, as proof of economic power as I indicated a moment ago, both of the lower courts relied upon the evidence of the allegedly cheaper more favorable loan terms which are challenged here, coupled with the allegedly higher price for the tied product, the houses and customer acceptance of that tie-in arrangement in those circumstances.","start":809.324,"stop":830.636,"duration":21.31},{"text":"We urge that even if these facts were submitted or supported by the record, they are not proof of power over credit.","start":830.636,"stop":839.91,"duration":9.27},{"text":"Reduced to their lowest common denominator, they are at most consistent with or tend to support the claim that the terms on which the loans were offered were in fact cheaper or more favorable.","start":839.91,"stop":853.718,"duration":13.81},{"text":"Proof of cheaper terms, however, as this Court held does not prove that the defendants had any unique ability to offer loans on such terms.","start":853.718,"stop":862.905,"duration":9.19},{"text":"It does not prove that other lenders were precluded in any way in matching those terms.","start":862.905,"stop":869.258,"duration":6.35},{"text":"Where the tie-in element is offered at a cheaper price, buyers will inevitably be attracted by that fact, particularly is that true where the tie-in element is fungible, such as money because no borrower, as we have noted, will pay other lenders a high price than he can obtain from some other lender.","start":869.258,"stop":889.489,"duration":20.23},{"text":"In those circumstances, we urge that acceptance of the tie-in condition, even by numerous customers, attracted by the allegedly lower price of the financing, is at most evidence that the credit terms were in fact cheaper or more favorable.","start":889.489,"stop":905.791,"duration":16.3},{"text":"It is not evidence of economic power.","start":905.791,"stop":909.116,"duration":3.32},{"text":"Similarly, I assume that Mr. Fortner had believed that defendant’s houses were over priced or otherwise non competitive at the time he negotiated the loan arrangements which are now challenged.","start":909.116,"stop":921.987,"duration":12.87},{"text":"I would note that the evidence is to the contrary.","start":921.987,"stop":924.544,"duration":2.56},{"text":"Mr. Fortner’s disenchantment with the houses appears to have occurred many months after he had negotiated, requested and entered into the second loan arrangement but…","start":924.544,"stop":933.677,"duration":9.13}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Flinn, let me just interrupt.","start":933.677,"stop":934.339,"duration":0.66},{"text":"Did you said the evidence is the contrary, but did not the judge find that they are $455 more expensive and the witness so testified, so we got its evidence?","start":934.339,"stop":942.968,"duration":8.63}]},{"speakerName":"Macdonald Flinn","textObjs":[{"text":"I agree, I did not mean to say that there was not a finding that the houses were higher priced.","start":942.968,"stop":947.427,"duration":4.46},{"text":"I meant to say there is no evidence that Mr. Fortner was in anyway disenchanted with the houses, deem them higher price...","start":947.427,"stop":956.202,"duration":8.77}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"But not the (Inaudible) that many.","start":956.202,"stop":957.467,"duration":1.26}]},{"speakerName":"Macdonald Flinn","textObjs":[{"text":"It makes a great deal with difference Mr. Justice Stevens.","start":957.467,"stop":959.755,"duration":2.29},{"text":"I believe that if at the time a buyer who enters into a tie-in arrangement, knowingly takes a product which he does not want, knowingly takes a product which is he believes is over priced, knowingly takes a product which he deems non competitive on any other basis, it can then be urged that on an inference that he has been economically coerced by some uniquely attractive singularly compelling aspect to the tie-in element and an inference of the economic power might be drawn from that.","start":959.755,"stop":989.76,"duration":30},{"text":"Now, I am saying first of all in this case, the evidence shows affirmatively though no finding was made on this one way or the other that at the time, Mr. Fortner solicited and negotiated not one but two financing arrangements.","start":989.76,"stop":1005.671,"duration":15.91},{"text":"He was in no way convinced that the houses were anything other than supportive, indeed as much as six months after the second loan arrangement, he stated in a letter that his principal competitor, Mr. Swindler, who had houses comparable to his, he was sure anybody who would look at the two houses would conclude that his US Steel Houses were both cheaper and better.","start":1005.671,"stop":1027.992,"duration":22.32},{"text":"I submit Mr. Swindler in order to survive in the real estate business notwithstanding that unhappy name, must have had very good houses at very low prices, and I think that Mr. Fortner’s own characterization suggests that it was not until long after he had negotiated the loan agreements that he deemed these houses to be in anyway defective or overpriced.","start":1027.992,"stop":1047.763,"duration":19.77},{"text":"My point is solely that no inference of economic power can be drawn from any disenchantment with the houses, since that disenchantment did not arise until after the loan arrangements had been negotiated but in…","start":1047.763,"stop":1060.916,"duration":13.15}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"I must have misunderstood your argument, because I thought you were saying that even if he paid more for the houses and knew it, it really would not make any difference as long as the total package was what the free market would dictate.","start":1060.916,"stop":1071.936,"duration":11.02}]},{"speakerName":"Macdonald Flinn","textObjs":[{"text":"That is the second part of my argument, Mr. Justice Stevens that even if, at the time, he entered into the loan arrangements, Mr. Fortner deemed the house overpriced or in any other way noncompetitive, he would in the circumstances of this kind of tie-in situations, have agreed to accept that burden of the tied product only if he concluded that the saving on the allegedly cheaper more favorable tie-in element, the loans at least compensated for that burden that he was assuming.","start":1071.936,"stop":1104.605,"duration":32.67},{"text":"Now, alternatively where the tie-in element is allegedly unique because offered on more favorable or cheaper terms than available elsewhere, the only way that a customer knowingly accepting the tie-in arrangement and knowingly accepting a higher priced tied product could evidence economic power would be if the premium or the over charge on the tied product, the houses exceeded the saving on the tie-in element and the evidence is devoid of any such evidence.","start":1104.605,"stop":1137.582,"duration":32.98},{"text":"It is directly devoid of any such evidence and I believe that the plaintiff makes no claims along those lines.","start":1137.582,"stop":1142.41,"duration":4.83}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Putting your point a little differently, Fortner could afford to pay more, but he has not, as
