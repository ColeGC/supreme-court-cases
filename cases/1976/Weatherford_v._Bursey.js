two principles in this case And when I say the two principles, I am speaking of Weatherford and Bursey, although of course Strom is a defendant and was the South Carolina Law Enforcement Chief.","start":61.486,"stop":90.313,"duration":28.83},{"text":"These events occurred, the events leading up to this litigation occurred in 1970, approximately at the end of a period of several years

important.","start":116.977,"stop":125.165,"duration":8.19},{"text":"He has been referred to in the case as a paid informer and I guess in the broad sense, he was, but nevertheless, he was a hired,

Carolina.","start":210.685,"stop":225.095,"duration":14.41},{"text":"The record would show further, I think, that Weatherford later married a very close friend, a roommate of Mr. Bursey’s wife.","start":225.095,"stop":236.103,"duration":11.01},{"text":"So, they were much closer than mere acquaintances and we think that that is important in this case.","start":236.103,"stop":246.223,"duration":10.12},{"text":"This association went on and of course, Bursey was completely without any knowledge that Weatherford was an undercover agent and the two, together with two other persons, who do not really enter this case except that they participated in the event in March of 1970 In order to demonstrate their opposition to the Vietnam War afflicted considerable damage to the personal property and the real property of the Selective Service Office, the Draft Board in Columbia, South Carolina.","start":246.223,"stop":288.983,"duration":42.76},{"text":"Admittedly, Strom, the police chief had been given prior notice of this crime by Weatherford.","start":288.983,"stop":299.877,"duration":10.89},{"text":"Weatherford did participate with Bursey and two others in the crime and although there were police agents in the building, who had been placed there in order to either stop the crime or capture the criminals, were unable to do so and the four persons escaped.","start":299.877,"stop":326.504,"duration":26.63},{"text":"That was early in the morning hours, I believe, of March 20, 1970.","start":326.504,"stop":330.384,"duration":3.88},{"text":"Later that same day, from information furnished to Chief Strom by his undercover

crime under the Law of South Carolina.","start":330.384,"stop":355.435,"duration":25.05},{"text":"Both were jailed on the same charge and Weatherford soon thereafter was released through an

release.","start":355.435,"stop":378.049,"duration":22.61},{"text":"Thereafter, and I think the record is clear on this with certain testimonials, although there was not a specific finding of fact by the trial judge on this particular point.","start":378.049,"stop":390.357,"duration":12.31},{"text":"It was decided and it was desirable from the State’s viewpoint to have the undercover agent, Weatherford continue as an undercover agent on the University of South Carolina Campus as long as he could because he was a valuable man according to the testimony and at that time, I believe, the testimony is that he was the only agent, only undercover agent on the University of South Carolina campus in the employ of SLED.","start":390.357,"stop":425.102,"duration":34.74},{"text":"It would have been impossible with the very close relationship between Weatherford and Bursey, for Bursey to have been -- to reveal himself it would have been impossible for him to do anything unusual without raising very great suspicion.","start":425.102,"stop":446.835,"duration":21.73},{"text":"And in order to see that Weatherford was not forced to deal with Bursey’s lawyer or he was not forced to make an explanation as to why he did not wish to be represented by Bursey’s lawyer, an explanation that would hardly have been plausible, the State Solicitor John W. Ford arranged which was admittedly a false arrangement for one before a local attorney, Frank Taylor, in Columbia a well-known attorney to pose as Weatherford’s attorney in this particular charge.","start":446.835,"stop":494.385,"duration":47.55}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"The State Solicitor that was here, a county or state official?","start":494.385,"stop":499.08,"duration":4.69}]},{"speakerName":"J.
