this lawsuit as I said, I think focuses upon the allowance of the reasonableness of the Secretary’s disallowance of an itemized deduction.","start":650.173,"stop":661.549,"duration":11.38},{"text":"I think the reasonableness of that regulation rests upon two general propositions.","start":661.549,"stop":667.999,"duration":6.45},{"text":"One, the disallowance of ordinary expenses such as transportation costs is fully consistent with the Act and is an effective and efficient method of administering the food stamp program.","start":667.999,"stop":680.639,"duration":12.64},{"text":"The second proposition, assuming that that general approach to transportation cost is reasonable, is that there is nothing in the Act or the constitution which requires the Secretary to treat appellees' training costs, any differently from the analogous expenditures and other households.","start":680.639,"stop":697.931,"duration":17.29},{"text":"With the first of these propositions, I think we can start with the Act itself.","start":697.931,"stop":701.635,"duration":3.7},{"text":"As I mentioned, Congress provided explicitly that it was income that was to determine the amount that a household is required to pay for food stamps.","start":701.635,"stop":711.16,"duration":9.52},{"text":"The Congress provided explicitly that the amount of the household be required to pay is a reasonable investment, but in no event more than 30% of household income.","start":711.16,"stop":722.225,"duration":11.07},{"text":"Now, that left 70% of household income that the Congress anticipated would be used for the households other non-food expenses.","start":722.225,"stop":730.331,"duration":8.11},{"text":"And thus it seems plainly consistent as a general matter for the Secretary to disallow itemized deductions for non-food expenses.","start":730.331,"stop":739.012,"duration":8.68},{"text":"I know by the way that the food stamp program in this regard is different from other programs such as AFDC for example, which seems to be based on actually available income.","start":739.012,"stop":749.107,"duration":10.1},{"text":"It’s not actually available income that is to key here whereas I pointed out it’s Congress anticipated that much of the income would not be actually available for food or would be not considered as part of the -- but nonetheless would be considered in the Secretary’s determination of income.","start":749.107,"stop":768.453,"duration":19.35},{"text":"I think an income standard in addition to being consistent with the Act is also an effective and efficient to way of administering the food stamp program.","start":768.453,"stop":779.505,"duration":11.05},{"text":"We have described this at length in our brief and I use the terms effective and efficient purposely here because those are the exact terms that Congress used in instructing the Secretary on how to administer the food stamp program.","start":779.505,"stop":793.977,"duration":14.47},{"text":"An income standard, again as we describe in our brief is certainly more effective and efficient than a standard which requires the Secretary to determine each month the amount of food or the amount of household income actually available for food.","start":793.977,"stop":809.257,"duration":15.28},{"text":"That is the standard which requires the Secretary to allow a deduction for all expenses that reduced food purchasing power and it seems to be the approach that is implicit in much of what District Court said in this case.","start":809.257,"stop":826.069,"duration":16.81},{"text":"Transportation costs are a prime candidate for disallowance under these general principles that I have talked about.","start":826.069,"stop":833.771,"duration":7.7},{"text":"Transportation costs are incurred by many households in the pursuit of a wide variety of endeavors.","start":833.771,"stop":839.627,"duration":5.86},{"text":"At the same time such costs are -- could be reasonably expected to vary widely among households and to depend to a large extent on personal consumption choices.","start":839.627,"stop":849.335,"duration":9.71},{"text":"For these reasons, it seems especially appropriate that the -- for the Secretary to simply let these expenses fall where they lie and to disallow an itemized deduction for such transportation costs.","start":849.335,"stop":861.485,"duration":12.15},{"text":"Appellees in their brief did not appear to express serious disagreement with the forgoing.","start":861.485,"stop":866.672,"duration":5.19},{"text":"They do not suggest that non-food expenses generally or even commutation costs should be deducted from household income.","start":866.672,"stop":874.725,"duration":8.05},{"text":"Instead, the principle burden of appellees brief appears to be that their transportation cost should be treated differently.","start":874.725,"stop":883.099,"duration":8.37},{"text":"But as I stated earlier, I think the second proposition under which the reasonableness of the Secretary’s regulation rests is that there was nothing in the Act and certainly nothing in the constitution which requires the Secretary to treat these transportation costs indifferently.","start":883.099,"stop":898.729,"duration":15.63},{"text":"Certainly, a concept of food purchasing power which so occupied the District Court in this case does not sustain that distinction.","start":898.729,"stop":906.095,"duration":7.37},{"text":"Appellee Karen Hein, we know from the record traveled from Muscatine to Davenport, Iowa to attend a training program.","start":906.095,"stop":913.886,"duration":7.79},{"text":"But certainly, there was nothing in the concept of food purchasing power which required that she -- those expenses be treated any

this respect, the court read the Act for far more than it was worth in this regard.","start":950.271,"stop":956.548,"duration":6.28},{"text":"The regulation -- the provision that the Secretary relies upon or that the court relied upon does nothing more than require as a criterion for eligibility that able bodied individuals be either employed, be ready and willing to find employment, to be a mother or caretaker of children or be a student.","start":956.548,"stop":977.231,"duration":20.68},{"text":"Able bodied individuals in any of those categories are equally eligible under the food stamp
