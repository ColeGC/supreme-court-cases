authorized state taxation of federal associations.","start":162.549,"stop":173.834,"duration":11.28},{"text":"In 1966, Massachusetts elected to tax federal associations.","start":173.834,"stop":179.69,"duration":5.86},{"text":"The tax as imposed was measured by a deposit element and by an income element.","start":179.69,"stop":186.395,"duration":6.71},{"text":"The statute is now challenged on the grounds that it conflicts with 1464 (h) because it discriminates against federal associations and also because it violates federal constitutional provisions.","start":186.395,"stop":199.763,"duration":13.37},{"text":"I propose to address four issues presented in our brief.","start":199.763,"stop":204.92,"duration":5.16},{"text":"The first is that the state statute exempts entirely all Massachusetts Credit Unions from the tax.","start":204.92,"stop":213.966,"duration":9.05},{"text":"The exemption is discriminatory if State Credit Unions are similar to federal associations within the meaning of 1464 (h).","start":213.966,"stop":224.862,"duration":10.9},{"text":"The largest Credit Unions in Massachusetts are functionally similar, though not identical in both powers and purposes and in operations to federal associations.","start":224.862,"stop":236.801,"duration":11.94},{"text":"The next two issues, which I would like to address, is whether the tax is a franchise tax or whether the commerce clause is violated.","start":236.801,"stop":246.072,"duration":9.27},{"text":"Both arise from one statutory defect and that is, that the statute has no apportionment provision.","start":246.072,"stop":253.38,"duration":7.31},{"text":"As a result, all income earned outside the Massachusetts by federal associations, is taxed by Commonwealth.","start":253.38,"stop":262.65,"duration":9.27},{"text":"Federal associations have earned during years that we have statistics about a third of their income from states other than Massachusetts.","start":262.65,"stop":272.353,"duration":9.7},{"text":"The associations are a part of a National Housing Program and necessarily do a large out-of-state

that.","start":297.165,"stop":307.999,"duration":10.83},{"text":"It fails to limit is tax based in any way.","start":307.999,"stop":312.92,"duration":4.92},{"text":"The commerce cause parallels to franchise tax issue.","start":312.92,"stop":317.489,"duration":4.57},{"text":"Again, no apportionment is provided where income earned outside the Commonwealth.","start":317.489,"stop":323.573,"duration":6.08},{"text":"The risk here is one of double taxation on the federal associations, which ought to be prohibited by the commerce clause.","start":323.573,"stop":333.869,"duration":10.3},{"text":"The final and perhaps most important issue is that the State Court found that the income measure of the tax discriminates against federal associations.","start":333.869,"stop":344.172,"duration":10.3},{"text":"The discrimination is caused by the deduction from income for required additions to surplus.","start":344.172,"stop":352.128,"duration":7.96},{"text":"All Thrift institutions have that kind of requirement.","start":352.128,"stop":356.985,"duration":4.86},{"text":"The terminology may vary from institution to institution, but they are called guarantee fund surplus or something equivalent to that.","start":356.985,"stop":366.483,"duration":9.5},{"text":"The State Court finding discrimination is clearly accurate, it should be dispositive of the case.","start":366.483,"stop":373.073,"duration":6.59},{"text":"However, the State Court excused the discrimination on the grounds that its source was a Federal Regulatory Agency, which regulates the amount of the reserve requirements for federal associations.","start":373.073,"stop":386.714,"duration":13.64},{"text":"The court also said that the associations have failed to show a substantial competitive disadvantage, neither justification is valid.","start":386.714,"stop":399.18,"duration":12.47},{"text":"This case arises as a result of a declaratory judgment by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.","start":399.18,"stop":408.141,"duration":8.96},{"text":"The record consists of a stipulated facts and an affidavit.","start":408.141,"stop":413.52,"duration":5.38},{"text":"The Court upheld the state’s statute against all challenges presented.","start":413.52,"stop":418.585,"duration":5.06},{"text":"It

elements of the tax to be invalid as against the federal associations on the grounds that it was discriminatory against them on the 1464 (h).","start":423.633,"stop":438.784,"duration":15.15},{"text":"The basis of the holding was that in general the mortgage deduction loans, which were a deduction from the deposits element, were applicable solely to them state institutions.

Commissioner, the character of an institution has been determined by its powers, not by what is does not in fact, but by what it might do.","start":510.404,"stop":526.329,"duration":15.92},{"text":"The basis of the holding is an institution may exercise the powers granted to it fully at any time.","start":526.329,"stop":534.016,"duration":7.69},{"text":"In the National Bank taxing cases, involving a statute related 1464 (h), the test is also based upon powers.","start":534.016,"stop":545.016,"duration":11},{"text":"For example, in Mercantile Bank v.

again, limited to their members.","start":2351.708,"stop":2374.157,"duration":22.45},{"text":"Credit Union simply cannot go out on a general market and seek to compete with other institutions, who lack the kind of limits that Credit Unions have.","start":2374.157,"stop":2384.623,"duration":10.47},{"text":"The facts, in short, are against the arguments that appellant are making and they do not support excusing appellants all together from state tax as they would have this Court do.","start":2384.623,"stop":2401.192,"duration":16.57},{"text":"At bottom, the argument here that the appellants present is one on tax policy.","start":2401.192,"stop":2406.472,"duration":5.28},{"text":"The fact is, as appellants have suggested with quoting a statement from President Carter, it is a policy debate that is now going on between the legislative and executive branches and Massachusetts believes that this Court should resist an attempt to draw the judiciary into the debate.","start":2406.472,"stop":2430.428,"duration":23.96},{"text":"I would like to set an out turn just briefly because appellant has not raised this issue in their oral argument to the question of discrimination between Federal Associations on the one hand and the state's treatment of those state entities which they do tax under Section 1464 (h), these are State Saving Banks and State Cooperative Banks.","start":2430.428,"stop":2455.674,"duration":25.25},{"text":"The question is whether Massachusetts has unfairly favored local savings institutions somehow at the expense of the Federal Associations.","start":2455.674,"stop":2464.948,"duration":9.27},{"text":"The vital facts are these.","start":2464.948,"stop":2468.375,"duration":3.43},{"text":"The statute, Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 63 Section 11, is neutral on its face.","start":2468.375,"stop":2476.349,"duration":7.97},{"text":"The rate of the tax is the same for the federal and state institutions.","start":2476.349,"stop":2480.407,"duration":4.06},{"text":"The types of deductions are identical and the appellants offer nothing apart from the face of the statute to suggest that it was past enacted as a hostile or unfriendly act towards the federal institution and these are the words that this Court has used in assessing the question of discrimination.","start":2480.407,"stop":2500.912,"duration":20.5},{"text":"As far as the appellant’s factual proof goes, they have made no showing of discrimination or disproportion in result between in taxing of federal state and institutions.","start":2500.912,"stop":2516.434,"duration":15.52},{"text":"Chiefly, they have made no showing that their actual tax burden in dollars and cents is any heavier proportionally than the tax burden of state institutions and under the decisions of this Court, the failure to show a difference in practical impact on account of the state tax is fatal to their case.","start":2516.434,"stop":2539.357,"duration":22.92},{"text":"The appellants, while they do not present evidence of actual tax impact do present some evidence about the amount of their deductions under the state tax as compared with their total assets.","start":2539.357,"stop":2552.484,"duration":13.13},{"text":"They present ratios comparing the amount of their deductions with total assets and compare that ratio to the ratio for state institutions.","start":2552.484,"stop":2561.161,"duration":8.68},{"text":"That ratio has no proximate relationship to actual tax burden about which the record is silent, but even looking at the ratios which are presented, there is no clear pattern this favoring the federal institutions.","start":2561.161,"stop":2578.392,"duration":17.23},{"text":"What those ratios of federal and state institution show is that in some years, the state’s institutions did enjoy a proportionally or comparatively a greater deduction than the federal institutions, but in other years, the reverse is the case.","start":2578.392,"stop":2594.983,"duration":16.59},{"text":"In three of the years presented by the appellants it was the federal institutions which enjoyed a greater benefit from the deduction, using the ratio evidence that they present and rely on.","start":2594.983,"stop":2612.006,"duration":17.02},{"text":"Finally, on this question of discrimination, this Court’s decisions under Section 1464 (h) and the companion provision permitting state tax on National Banks 12 U.S.C. 548, this Court’s decisions under both of those Sections leave no doubt in our view that the state tax is valid.","start":2612.006,"stop":2634.959,"duration":22.95},{"text":"Those decisions require fairness and even handedness from the states.","start":2634.959,"stop":2640.012,"duration":5.05},{"text":"Appellants have shied away from these principles and instead their argument demands rigid, mathematical equality between state and federal institutions.","start":2640.012,"stop":2650.895,"duration":10.88},{"text":"Following their analysis, no deduction which had a disparate result or even the potential for a disparate result, no matter how small could stand under the principle of discrimination which they advance.","start":2650.895,"stop":2666.689,"duration":15.79},{"text":"In our view, following this Court’s more practical standard of fairness, the appellants claim of discrimination falls short.","start":2666.689,"stop":2678.562,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Finally, I would like to turn to the question of whether or not the state tax intrudes impermissibly on interstate commerce under the principles lay down by this Court under the commerce clause.","start":2678.562,"stop":2695.184,"duration":16.62},{"text":"We believe that on this issue, appellants do not law or evidence on their side.","start":2695.184,"stop":2700.738,"duration":5.55},{"text":"There is no direct evidence whatsoever of the extent of income that the appellants derive from interstate commerce.","start":2700.738,"stop":2708.393,"duration":7.66},{"text":"The record is bare on how many borrowers, real estate mortgage borrowers, live out of state and there is no evidence on how many these loans were culminated out of state, however, we do know this.","start":2708.393,"stop":2723.806,"duration":15.41},{"text":"We do know that everyone of appellants have all their offices in Massachusetts, and therefore, all of the processing of the loans, all the monitoring of the loans and all the receiving of the loans, goes on in Massachusetts.","start":2723.806,"stop":2743.38,"duration":19.57},{"text":"Well, we believe the record thus establishes two independent bases, under the commerce clause principles for the tax that Massachusetts has imposed.","start":2743.38,"stop":2752.596,"duration":9.22},{"text":"The first relies on the fact that Massachusetts is the state of domicile for the Appellant Associations and under this Court’s decision, a strong presumption exists in favor of a state’s right to demand a support in contribution in the costs of government, when that demand is made by the home state of the corporation.","start":2752.596,"stop":2776.449,"duration":23.85},{"text":"Then second, quite apart from domicile, putting domicile aside, the record shows in this case a close connection between the taxing State Massachusetts and the activities and income upon which the Massachusetts tax has levied.","start":2776.449,"stop":2794.409,"duration":17.96},{"text":"As a final point under commerce clause, appellants raise the specter of multiple taxation, but they simply have no foundation in our view for arguing that interstate commerce is in jeopardy of multiple taxation and the burden that would flow there from.","start":2794.409,"stop":2812.343,"duration":17.93},{"text":"There is no overlapping tax that exists right now and it would be a strange, we believe, to strike down this current justified tax on the basis that in the future, some state with a lesser claim and a lesser right might impose some tax burden or might stake a claim to a tax burden on some portion of appellant’s income.","start":2812.343,"stop":2838.981,"duration":26.64},{"text":"In our view, this is a “thin ice” for a constitutional challenge to a state tax.","start":2838.981,"stop":2846.131,"duration":7.15},{"text":"We believe, therefore, and for this reason and other reasons are presented, the reasons the Commonwealth has presented in its brief that the state tax should stand and the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.","start":2846.131,"stop":2861.016,"duration":14.89},{"text":"Thank you very
