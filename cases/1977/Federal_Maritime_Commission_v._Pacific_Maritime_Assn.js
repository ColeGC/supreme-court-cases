to file with the Federal Maritime Commission, a category, seven different categories of agreements.","start":16.767,"stop":28.912,"duration":12.15},{"text":"One of which is every agreement controlling regulating preventing or destroying competition.","start":28.912,"stop":35.056,"duration":6.14},{"text":"Now the commission is instructed by the statute to disapprove agreements that fail to meet certain statutory criteria and to approve all others.","start":35.056,"stop":45.289,"duration":10.23},{"text":"It is illegal either to carry out either an agreement of that the commission has not approved subject to the Act or one that has been disapproved, and any agreement approved by the commission, thereby obtains antitrust immunity.","start":45.289,"stop":62.292,"duration":17},{"text":"There are two questions in this case which is here on a writ of Certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.","start":62.292,"stop":68.964,"duration":6.67},{"text":"The first one is whether Section Fifteen covers any provision of collective-bargaining agreements, and the second is if that question is answered affirmatively whether the Federal Maritime Commission in this case, properly denied to the particular provisions here involved a labor exemption and exemption that the commission has recognized as appropriate under section 15 for collective-bargaining in certain circumstances.","start":68.964,"stop":96.967,"duration":28},{"text":"The respondent, the Pacific Maritime Association is an employers association comprised of most of the employees in the west coast Maritime Industry, steam ship companies terminal operators and stevedores.","start":96.967,"stop":111.449,"duration":14.48},{"text":"The respondent International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union is the collective-bargaining represented of the employees in that industry and bargaining on the Pacific West Coast generally take place on an areawide basis.","start":111.449,"stop":127.151,"duration":15.7},{"text":"There are however a small number of employers operating on the west coast who are not members of Pacific Maritime Industry including a number of ports on the pacific west coast, that operate their own terminal facilities.","start":127.151,"stop":142.345,"duration":15.19},{"text":"Since 1935, PMA and its predecessors in the Union have operated under a collective-bargaining agreement that provided detail arrangements governing the operation of the waterfront on the west cost.","start":142.345,"stop":157.858,"duration":15.51},{"text":"The most important aspects of this is that together they have organized in control a joint registered workforce, a force which is registered and which is dispatched under Union hiring halls that are jointly administrated to particular employers on a job basis, the men are rotated, you do not have a particular crew working full time for a particular employer.","start":157.858,"stop":183.485,"duration":25.63},{"text":"The men are rotated from job to job as the jobs come up.","start":183.485,"stop":189.305,"duration":5.82},{"text":"The PMA has a very elaborate system of central record keeping and payroll records, everyone is paid centrally even though they work for one employer for two days and another employer for three days of the week, and in addition there is a very extensive jointly operated fringe-benefit program under which they have a guaranteed annual wage, pension plans, welfare plans, vacations plans and so on and all members of PMA are required to contribute to the fund that sustains these fringe-benefits.","start":189.305,"stop":224.272,"duration":34.97},{"text":"Now prior to 1972 which was when the agreement involved in this case was negotiated.","start":224.272,"stop":232.099,"duration":7.83},{"text":"Employers who are not members of PMA could obtain men from registered workforce, Union members by negotiating directly with the local Unions involved in their particular areas and this happened frequently separate contracts were negotiated between many of the ports involved in this case and the local Union.","start":232.099,"stop":252.365,"duration":20.27},{"text":"And in addition the individual ports were able to negotiate for the fringe-benefits provided under the master contract by a participation agreement that they negotiated with PMA and the Union.","start":252.365,"stop":267.271,"duration":14.91},{"text":"And under this arrangement, the Union permitted some of the nonmembers employers to use what they called steady gangs or steady men that is men who worked full time for one employer rather being rotated from individual to individual.","start":267.271,"stop":284.434,"duration":17.16},{"text":"PMA was of the view of that the nonmembers use of the registered work force has it functioned put its members the PMA members under what they described as an obvious competitive disadvantage as against the nonmembers.","start":284.434,"stop":300.865,"duration":16.43},{"text":"And a major reason, PMA's President indicated, page 90 of the record was that under this arrangement if PMA members will close down as result of a labor dispute, the members of the ports who are not members could continue to operate because they were not bound by the arrangements, they were not members of PMA and as result of this cargo and business was diverted from the members of PMA during these periods of labor disturbance to the nonmembers, which they thought was gave the nonmembers, an unfair competitive advantage.","start":300.865,"stop":337.053,"duration":36.19},{"text":"They also believed that the use of the steady men gave them an advantage and finally they thought that it gave the nonmembers an advantage that they were not required to pay their full share of the fringe-benefits, in the same way the PMA members were, and after extensive bargaining in 1972, PMA and the union agreed upon something called the Nonmember Participation Agreement.","start":337.053,"stop":362.961,"duration":25.91},{"text":"An arrangement that was made a part of the collective-bargaining agreement, and the provisions provides that nonmembers must agree to be bound by the terms of the nonmembers participation agreement as a condition to using the registered work force.","start":362.961,"stop":379.654,"duration":16.69},{"text":"Now, we set forth in our brief, a number of provisions at pages 10 and 11 of a brief a number provisions of this nonmember participation agreement, that had an impact upon the nonmembers but there are two of them that I would like to stress at this argument because those are the ones we think that probably have the greatest impact in terms of competition.","start":379.654,"stop":401.679,"duration":22.02},{"text":"The first thing was that the nonmembers must use the registered workforce upon the same terms as the members which included drawing them off course from the hiring halls which they had been doing in the past and a limited use of them in the case there were Union works stoppages against PMA to the same extent that members of PMA were limited and the non-member participation agreement stated the essence of the this requirement was the acceptance by nonmembers participants of the principle that a work stoppage ILWU against PMA members is a work stoppage against nonmember participants.","start":401.679,"stop":445.284,"duration":43.61},{"text":"In other words, if there was a work stoppage against PMA the nonmembers of PMA nevertheless would be bound not to use the work force at the time PMA members were barred from it.","start":445.284,"stop":459.832,"duration":14.55},{"text":"The second thing is that the nonmembers who wished to use the registered workforce had to participate in the fringe-benefit plan on the same terms and conditions as PMA members, that is they had to same payments to the fringe-benefit program that PMA members would make.","start":459.832,"stop":481.231,"duration":21.4},{"text":"After the union and PMA agreed upon this nonmember participation agreement, they endeavored to get the nonmember ports to sign the agreement and they pointed out to the nonmember ports that unless they sign this agreement they would not be able to use the registered workforce and that is set forth at pages 65 and 77 of the appendix.","start":481.231,"stop":506.365,"duration":25.13}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Friedman, you referred to nonmember ports and that my understanding is that the PMA
