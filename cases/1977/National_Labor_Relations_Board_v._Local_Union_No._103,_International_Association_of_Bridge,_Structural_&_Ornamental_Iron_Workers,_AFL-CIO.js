representative.","start":506.418,"stop":528.809,"duration":22.39},{"text":"Now, the basic question that we come down to here is whether the 8 (f) agreement removes the picketing from the reach of 8

already been resolved.","start":528.809,"stop":556.855,"duration":28.05},{"text":"In the board's view, and 8 (f) agreement does not without more establish that the union is the majority

picketing.","start":576.395,"stop":602.731,"duration":26.34},{"text":"Now, the board's position rests upon the following considerations.","start":602.731,"stop":607.246,"duration":4.51},{"text":"In the first place, we start with the language of the statute which is set forth at page three of the board's brief.","start":607.246,"stop":617.375,"duration":10.13},{"text":"It provides that it shall not be an unfair labor practice for employers or unions in the construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged or who upon their employment will be engaged in that industry because the majority status of such labor organization has not been established under the provisions of Section 9, prior to the making of such agreement.","start":617.375,"stop":644.344,"duration":26.97},{"text":"Now, nothing in that language suggests that it was intended to confer upon a union that is a party to a pre-hire agreement.","start":644.344,"stop":653.003,"duration":8.66},{"text":"The status of a Section 9 (a) or majority representative.","start":653.003,"stop":657.413,"duration":4.41},{"text":"Congress did not in Section 8 (f) or elsewhere modify Sections 8 (a)(5) or 9 (a).","start":657.413,"stop":665.647,"duration":8.23},{"text":"The former as I have indicated obligates the employer to bargain with the representative of his employees subject to the provisions of 9 (a) and 9 (a) defines the bargaining representative as the representative selected by the majority of the employees in an appropriate unit.","start":665.647,"stop":684.28,"duration":18.63},{"text":"Moreover, while the board's well established contract bar rules would preclude the board from entertaining a representation petition during the life of a collective – an ordinary collective bargaining agreement.","start":684.28,"stop":701.55,"duration":17.27},{"text":"The last proviso of the Section 8 (f) which is on page four of the brief provides that any agreement which would be invalid but for clause one which permits without the majority being established, shall not be a bar to a petition filed pursuant to Section 9 (c)

clause.","start":701.55,"stop":737.945,"duration":36.4},{"text":"Now, the legislative history, we believe confirms that Congress in authorizing pre-hire agreements intended to do nothing more, because of the peculiar characteristics of the building and construction industry to relieve them from what would otherwise be a clear violation of the National Labor Relations Act.","start":737.945,"stop":775.286,"duration":37.34},{"text":"I have mentioned earlier that --and this court so held in the Garment Workers case a number of years ago, that in the ordinary case, an

agreement.","start":775.286,"stop":804.866,"duration":29.58},{"text":"This did not work for the building and construction industry because of the short term nature of most construction projects, and the fact that the employers ordinarily lacked a steady complement of employees, is necessary for employers to enter into labor agreements before the job is started or the workers are hired.","start":804.866,"stop":833.457,"duration":28.59},{"text":"So, 8 (f) was enacted to relieve them of having to comply with what would otherwise be an impossible rule for the building and
