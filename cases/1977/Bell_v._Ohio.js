think it would be helpful to delineate the issues briefly and to go into the Ohio statute, both as the legislative history has developed it and as it is operational at the present time.","start":60.047,"stop":76.974,"duration":16.93},{"text":"The basic issues that we see in the challenge of the constitutionality of the statute, are, first is the Ohio statute place unconstitutional limitations upon the meaningful consideration of mitigating factors.","start":76.974,"stop":91.481,"duration":14.51},{"text":"Secondly, whether the Ohio capital mitigation set forth in the statute, so narrowly -- is so narrowly circumscribed by the statutes and further by the judicial clause put on it by the Ohio Supreme Court that it precludes consideration of these important factors, and therefore, is virtually a mandatory, and therefore, unconstitutional capital system.","start":91.481,"stop":114.849,"duration":23.37},{"text":"Finally does the Ohio statute permit a sentence or even require a death sentence which is grossly disproportionate to such as to violate the constitution and we claim that the answer to those issues are affirmative in all three instances.","start":114.849,"stop":134.138,"duration":19.29},{"text":"The Ohio capital statute presently in affect had its genesis before the decision of this Court in Furman as part of an overhaul of all of Ohio's criminal statutes.","start":134.138,"stop":148.504,"duration":14.37},{"text":"When it was first introduced and passed by the Ohio House, it was a model of constitutionality as we have come to see from the Gregg cases.","start":148.504,"stop":158.412,"duration":9.91},{"text":"It had open ended, broad mitigating factors included.","start":158.412,"stop":163.082,"duration":4.67},{"text":"It had jury participation in the sentencing process guaranteed.","start":163.082,"stop":168.332,"duration":5.25},{"text":"It had a broad roster of aggravating circumstances and the statutes provided for a bifurcated proceedings.","start":168.332,"stop":177.932,"duration":9.6},{"text":"While that bill had passed the house and was presently or was at time in the Senate of Ohio, this Court decided the Furman case and the Ohio Senate felt required by Furman, due to its own legislative service committee's recommendations which are cited in the Amicus Brief that to permit discretion even though there were specific mitigating factors enumerated to permit any discretion might be to resolve in the statutes being declared unconstitutional under Furman.","start":177.932,"stop":215.145,"duration":37.21},{"text":"So the final bill as it was passed, retained the bifurcated proceedings, retained all of the, I believe eight aggravating circumstances.","start":215.145,"stop":227.669,"duration":12.52},{"text":"The mitigating circumstances which were open ended were illuminated eliminated and, but three narrow mitigating circumstances were put into the statute.","start":227.669,"stop":237.233,"duration":9.56},{"text":"Also omitted from the final version was jury participation in sentencing.","start":237.233,"stop":247.566,"duration":10.33},{"text":"We feel that the Ohio Legislature has did the legislatures in Louisiana and North Carolina, misconstrued from it.","start":247.566,"stop":259.452,"duration":11.89},{"text":"They felt I think that Furman was -- stood for the position that any discretion in the part of sentencing would be unconstitutional.","start":259.452,"stop":273.771,"duration":14.32},{"text":"In the present statutes, two statutes within the same group, specifically remove discretion from the Trial Court in sentencing.","start":273.771,"stop":289.424,"duration":15.65},{"text":"2929.03(E) which we have cited on page 5 of our brief, indicates that if the Court finds that none of the mitigating circumstances listed in Division B of 2929.04, the revise code, is established by preponderance of the evidence, it shall impose sentence of death on the offender, otherwise it shall impose sentence of life imprisonment on the offender.","start":289.424,"stop":315.986,"duration":26.56},{"text":"Now, it is fairly clear in itself, but they go on, on page 6 of our brief it is cited, they repeat this and this is 2929.04(B) down at the bottom of the page where the three mitigating circumstances which we will discuss in a moment are listed.","start":315.986,"stop":333.839,"duration":17.85},{"text":"Again, it states that death penalty is precluded when considering the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history character or condition of the offender, one or more of the following is established by a preponderance of the evidence is precluded.","start":333.839,"stop":346.797,"duration":12.96},{"text":"So the sentencing really has no discretion at all under the Ohio statute.","start":346.797,"stop":351.884,"duration":5.09},{"text":"If the facts are -- as found to constitute a mitigating circumstance, then the offender will live.","start":351.884,"stop":359.568,"duration":7.68},{"text":"If the facts do not constitute one of the three statutory mitigating factors, he will die. So there is no sentencing discretion whatsoever.","start":359.568,"stop":373.289,"duration":13.72},{"text":"Even more significant change that the Ohio Senate made in the statute in response to Furman was the narrowing of the mitigating factors.","start":373.289,"stop":385.389,"duration":12.1},{"text":"The broad open ended mitigating factor was eliminated, but three remained.","start":385.389,"stop":391.657,"duration":6.27},{"text":"I would distinguish that from I believe eight in Florida and the open ended statutes in the Texas and Georgia statutes.","start":391.657,"stop":401.109,"duration":9.45},{"text":"The most important of the mitigating circumstances because it is the only mitigating circumstance that has anything at all to do with the personality and the individual offender is the third and that provides that the death penalty is precluded if the offense was primarily the product of the offender's psychosis or mental deficiency, though such condition is insufficient to establish the defense of insanity.","start":401.109,"stop":430.925,"duration":29.82},{"text":"Psychosis has been defined as a major severe form of mental disorder or disease that is Random House Dictionary's definition and Webster as the aggitive profound mental disease.","start":430.925,"stop":445.629,"duration":14.7},{"text":"So, either a person who is --","start":445.629,"stop":448.004,"duration":2.38}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

Bailus.","start":491.237,"stop":497.111,"duration":5.87},{"text":"They cited two medical dictionaries, case law and the court psychiatrist in that particular case.","start":497.111,"stop":503.115,"duration":6},{"text":"In the medical dictionaries they cite -- indicate to further characterize what retardation is, is that a moron is the highest retard in intelligence and an idiot is the lowest in an imbecile is in between.","start":503.115,"stop":521.568,"duration":18.45},{"text":"The authorities, psychiatric authorities cited in our brief indicated that a moron is someone with an IQ of 70 or less, a mental age of 12 or less and the other two are below that.","start":521.568,"stop":534.662,"duration":13.09},{"text":"Therefore, under the Ohio statute, under this third mitigating circumstance, the only one dealing with the offender himself, only a psychotic, a moron, an imbecile or an idiot has a reasonable chance of surviving the sentencing process and then only if that condition, that mental condition caused the offense.","start":534.662,"stop":560.717,"duration":26.05},{"text":"The other statutory factors --","start":560.717,"stop":562.47,"duration":1.75}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

death.","start":567.272,"stop":581.344,"duration":14.07},{"text":"If one of the judges finds a circumstance present then the sentence is life, even though the other two may feel that the death penalty is warned.","start":581.344,"stop":590.941,"duration":9.6},{"text":"The first of these three mitigating circumstances as it appears in the statute is victim inducement, that the victim induced or facilitated his own death.","start":590.941,"stop":600.214,"duration":9.27},{"text":"If this can be shown to a preponderance, then the offender will escape with his life.","start":600.214,"stop":605.647,"duration":5.43},{"text":"However, we must remember that we are talking about an aggravated murder situation.","start":605.647,"stop":611.307,"duration":5.66},{"text":"Not all taking of life is aggravated murder.","start":611.307,"stop":614.097,"duration":2.79},{"text":"One of the aggravating circumstances must be present.","start":614.097,"stop":619.369,"duration":5.27},{"text":"The only one that I could conceive would be murder for hire, because that would involve the victim hiring his own killer.","start":619.369,"stop":628.971,"duration":9.6},{"text":"I suppose if a case like that ever comes along, perhaps the victim inducement mitigation will have some significance, but we feel that it is basically illusory.","start":628.971,"stop":638.192,"duration":9.22},{"text":"Although, there was one Northern Ohio appellate case where the court did find victim inducement where the victim was armed and it involved a narcotics purchase.","start":638.192,"stop":649.479,"duration":11.29},{"text":"However, that unreported appellate case, added another element.","start":649.479,"stop":653.616,"duration":4.14},{"text":"They said, that the only time you can even consider using victim inducement is mitigation as if the victim himself is acting unlawfully and that condition is not even in the statute.","start":653.616,"stop":667.56,"duration":13.94},{"text":"The final mitigating circumstance is that it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed, but for the fact that the offender was under a duress, coercion or strong provocation.","start":667.56,"stop":680.317,"duration":12.76},{"text":"Duress and coercion though has been interpreted in Ohio's capital context by the Ohio Supreme Court is such compulsion that will overcome the mind or volition of the defendant, so that he acted other than he would ordinarily have acted in those circumstances which we feel at least more as the distinction if any between mitigating duress and coercion and the duress and coercion which is a defense to any crime.","start":680.317,"stop":707.615,"duration":27.3},{"text":"In our own case, they have further blurred that distinction by applying the doctrine of withdrawal, on page 142 of the Appendix.","start":707.615,"stop":723.62,"duration":16},{"text":"The court said, even if it were believe that appellant, that is Bell, was apprehensive of Hall and was forced to go along with the crimes, the hard fact remains that appellant could very easily have quit the scheme when following in another car.","start":723.62,"stop":737.539,"duration":13.92},{"text":"And in the other case, the Woods case that we have referred to in our brief, the Ohio Supreme Court has in discussing the doctrine of withdrawal, withdrawal as applied to the defensive of duress, really blurred the distinction between the two.","start":737.539,"stop":754.029,"duration":16.49},{"text":"There really is no distinction.","start":754.029,"stop":755.976,"duration":1.95},{"text":"If a defendant is acting of his own free mind or will, then he is under such duress or coercion that makes him not guilty of the offense at all and he will not even have to worry about getting to a penalty trial, because he will be found not guilty at the close of the trial.","start":755.976,"stop":775.802,"duration":19.83},{"text":"Now, it is important to note here, extremely important that these are three exclusive mitigating factors.","start":775.802,"stop":783.805,"duration":8},{"text":"There are no other mitigating factors in Ohio, either in the statute, or in the interpretation.","start":783.805,"stop":790.565,"duration":6.76},{"text":"There is a lot of talk about some other factors in some of the cases, but there are no other mitigating factors.","start":790.565,"stop":800.782,"duration":10.22},{"text":"In our particular case, where we have alleged several mitigating factors which this Court has held to be constitutionally significant which we will discuss in a moment that basically they are the youth of the offender, his non participation in the offense, his cooperation with police, his drug involvement, his emotional disturbance, his domination by someone else, none of these factors were considered at least independently.","start":800.782,"stop":825.981,"duration":25.2},{"text":"The Ohio Supreme Court said and
