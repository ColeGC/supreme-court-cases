believe that both the clear language of the statute as well as the legislative history indicate a Congressional intent to circumscribe the private right of action and to have the 180 day period not modified, except perhaps in very egregious circumstances certainly not present in the record here.","start":120.202,"stop":143.043,"duration":22.84},{"text":"We believe that the legislative history for instance indicates that the 180 day period was not initially contained in the House Pass.","start":143.043,"stop":156.632,"duration":13.59},{"text":"The senate included the 180 day requirement and then the house receded to the senate's request for the 180 day requirement.","start":156.632,"stop":168.867,"duration":12.23},{"text":"The 180 day requirement was lobbied extensively for by management in order to circumscribe the right of action of individuals and in order to give we believe the Department of Labor close to exclusive jurisdiction of age discrimination cases.","start":168.867,"stop":189.628,"duration":20.76},{"text":"Employers did not want, we believe the Congressional and legislative history says, employers did not want any private right of action to be maintained, because they could see the possibility of frivolous lawsuits being brought and frivolous lawsuits are of course expensive and it is clear that the employers clearly preferred that there would be a limited right for private action only in the first 180 day period, only if notice to the intent of sue was given in the 180 day period.","start":189.628,"stop":227.937,"duration":38.31},{"text":"We believe also that clear statutory language which is of course the best evidence of what Congress intended sets forth that such a notice shall be filed within 180 day.","start":227.937,"stop":241.27,"duration":13.33},{"text":"Mrs. Dartt contends, I believe alternatively, that either her oral complaint to the Department of Labor within the 180-day period satisfied or it tolled the time for her to meet the notice of intent to sue requirement within clearly her oral complaint which she stipulated and included no evidence of suing or of an intent to sue Shell.","start":241.27,"stop":267.972,"duration":26.7},{"text":"We believe her oral complaint clearly did not satisfy the 180 day notice requirement and that Court of Appeals so found.","start":267.972,"stop":277.509,"duration":9.54},{"text":"The Court of Appeals found, however, that the 180 day period was analogous to a statute of limitations, and therefore, could be tolled on certain equitable grounds.","start":277.509,"stop":291.277,"duration":13.77},{"text":"We believe that even assuming that the Court of Appeals was correct in it is holding that the 180 day time period is analogous to a statute of limitations, it certainly was incorrect in finding that based upon substantial precedents by this Court that this case is or that the situation here warranted a tolling of that time period.","start":291.277,"stop":315.371,"duration":24.09},{"text":"To recognize equitable grounds for tolling of 180 day requirement or a statute of limitations requirement, that the defendant has acted in some way to mislead or prevent the plaintiff from acting, that the plaintiff was acting under some kind of recognized legal disability or that the plaintiff was prevented by operation of law from acting to preserve their rights.","start":315.371,"stop":343.158,"duration":27.79},{"text":"We believe the fact situation here establishes and the record so shows that all Mrs. Dartt did was she called an attorney, preliminarily after she felt that she had been discharged because of her age, the attorney did not tell her of the notice requirement.","start":343.158,"stop":359.107,"duration":15.95},{"text":"The attorney told her to go to the Department of Labor.","start":359.107,"stop":361.667,"duration":2.56},{"text":"She went to the Department of Labor.","start":361.667,"stop":363.64,"duration":1.97},{"text":"The Department of Labor treated her complaint as being a complaint which could activate the administrative investigative mechanisms, did not, the Department of Labor stated that it did not consider her oral complaint to be notice of intent to sue.","start":363.64,"stop":378.565,"duration":14.93},{"text":"In fact, it advised Shell that no notice of intent to sue had been filed and then proceeded to process a complaint.","start":378.565,"stop":388.068,"duration":9.5},{"text":"We do not believe that these circumstances indicate Mrs. Dartt and I am stepping back just a moment, Mrs. Dartt also stated that when she went to the Department of Labor, she sat down.","start":388.068,"stop":401.685,"duration":13.62},{"text":"I believe, I thought well, as theDepartment of Labor would handle it then why bother with an attorney, why bother with the expensive attorney.","start":401.685,"stop":410.387,"duration":8.7},{"text":"She was asked in the district court whether she made any inquiry as what was necessary to preserve her rights, if she had inquired it any time from the Department of Labor as to what she needed to do and her answer was no that she did not, that she went to them and she thought they would take care of everything, and therefore, she had properly relied upon them to advise her of 180 day notice of intent to sue requirement which the Department of Labor did not do, but which the Court of Appeals found they had statutory obligation to do.","start":410.387,"stop":446.163,"duration":35.78}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Ms. Matthies, I take it there is no

fact argued in the district court, although did not continue to press that in the Court of Appeals to my recollection, that the 180 day requirement was in fact what I believe they termed as directory rather than the mandatory and that would fall into I suppose what you call the third classification of cases.","start":710.29,"stop":731.135,"duration":20.85},{"text":"I do not really think that we can -- that this time limitation, the 180 day time limitation would fall into the third category of cases.","start":731.135,"stop":741.437,"duration":10.3},{"text":"I think the close analogy perhaps of the 180 day requirement here to the 180 day requirement under Title VII indicates that it is in fact a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.","start":741.437,"stop":756.708,"duration":15.27},{"text":"The wording of the statute itself indicates that the filing of the notice for intent to sue within the 180 day period is in fact a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.","start":756.708,"stop":767.389,"duration":10.68},{"text":"I note in the senate report on the new possible amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that the senate when they deleted the 180 day requirement from the notice of intent to sue provision stated that they were deleting the requirement of a notice of intent to sue, which I think kind of tends to indicate that the senate -- that the 180 day requirement was a substantial requirement.","start":767.389,"stop":795.822,"duration":28.43},{"text":"And the legislative history itself indicates that the senate considered it to be a substantial requirement when the house deleted the 180 day requirement when the senate passed bill and the senate put it right back in saying we want there to be a 180 day limitation.","start":795.822,"stop":813.072,"duration":17.25},{"text":"So if we were to take the position here that we were going to allow any kind of tolling, for instance is the 180 day requirement, I think what we get into Your Honor is adapting on approach that the house and the senate ended up specifically rejecting, because the house bill had provided for the allowance of a filling of a notice for intent to sue any time within the statute of limitations period, the two year statue to limitations period.","start":813.072,"stop":846.437,"duration":33.37},{"text":"And the senate said no, we want a notice of intent to suit filed within a 180 days and I think that that indicates very clearly that the Congress considered it to be a substantial requirement.","start":846.437,"stop":859.436,"duration":13},{"text":"So turning back to the decisions by or the decision by the Court of Appeals.","start":859.436,"stop":868.299,"duration":8.86},{"text":"Although the Court of Appeals did not specifically saying so, the Court of Appeals I believe followed what could be characterized as an extension of the tolling principles annunciated by this Court in Burnett v. the New York Central Railroad Company and the rationale behind the tolling allowed by the Tenth Circuit was that in this particular situation they felt that the de facto purposes, the filling of the or the registering of the oral complaint and a subsequent isolated settlement inquiry by the Department of Labor fulfilled the notice and conciliation functions of Section 626 (d), and therefore, there was no particular reason in this situation to not toll the 180 day time limitation.","start":868.299,"stop":929.329,"duration":61.03},{"text":"We do not believe that Burnett is controlling here.","start":929.329,"stop":932.129,"duration":2.8},{"text":"We believe that the rationale of Burnett applies to a very, very limited situations.","start":932.129,"stop":939.571,"duration":7.44},{"text":"In the first place, Burnett dealt with an ordinary statute of limitations.","start":939.571,"stop":945.586,"duration":6.01},{"text":"The Burnett facts were significantly different from the facts present in this particular case.","start":945.586,"stop":952.648,"duration":7.06},{"text":"In Burnett, the defendant received all of the notice contemplated by the statute and otherwise valid complaint was issued.","start":952.648,"stop":962.059,"duration":9.41},{"text":"There was no defect in process or in service of process.","start":962.059,"stop":965.792,"duration":3.73},{"text":"The only defect was in venue.","start":965.792,"stop":970.732,"duration":4.94},{"text":"The fact that there was only a defect in venue was deemed important because Congress had number one, expressed a desire for uniform time limitations by enacting the statute of limitations provisions in Philiff (ph) and to not allow tolling would have caused a substantial non uniformity in time limitations because many states as well as the federal government had savings or venue transfer provisions and that had, if the plaintiff resided in any other part of the country then where he did, in Burnett, there was a good possibility that his cause of action would have been safe.","start":970.732,"stop":1017.439,"duration":46.71},{"text":"And this Court looking at the fact that there was only a defect in venue and the fact that the Congress had indicated its desire for uniform time limitations in Philiff (ph) and also noting that the Congress had indicated a desire for saving improperly venued actions by allowing transfer, having enacted a statute to that precise effect, this court decided that there should be a tolling in Burnett.","start":1017.439,"stop":1045.855,"duration":28.42},{"text":"It is also significant in Burnett that the plaintiff would have lost all means of relief.","start":1045.855,"stop":1052.621,"duration":6.77},{"text":"It is also significant in Burnett that the defendant could have waived according to this Court the defect in venue.","start":1052.621,"stop":1060.672,"duration":8.05},{"text":"If in fact that the Section in 626 (d) requirement is jurisdictional as we can contend then it is clear and I think the decisions of this Courts have so held that a party cannot waive a jurisdictional defect.","start":1060.672,"stop":1076.307,"duration":15.63},{"text":"It cannot be waived even with consent of the parties, whereas the defect of venue in Burnett could.","start":1076.307,"stop":1082.738,"duration":6.43},{"text":"There was also and I think this is probably one of the most important differences, there was a fixed time period in Burnett to which the tolling would apply so that you had clearcut periods from the time of the institution of the action to the time when the action was dismissed where you could say yes a tolling in fact occurred here.","start":1082.738,"stop":1106.959,"duration":24.22},{"text":"I do not believe and I think this would be an interesting question to ask a person, I do not believe that there is any triggering period where you can say that the statute was tolled here and then starts again here, if you allow tolling for oral complaints.","start":1106.959,"stop":1122.333,"duration":15.37},{"text":"You have an oral complaint filed with the Department of Labor then when does the statute to start run again.","start":1122.333,"stop":1125.536,"duration":3.2},{"text":"Does it run when they actual knowledge of the notice requirement?","start":1125.536,"stop":1131.572,"duration":6.04},{"text":"Can this tolling extended definitely and thereby toll the 255 two-year statute of limitations?","start":1131.572,"stop":1139.128,"duration":7.56},{"text":"What is the triggering effect of that?","start":1139.128,"stop":1146.429,"duration":7.3},{"text":"We also believe that the express ruling by this Court and the Unexcelled Chemical Corporation case with respect to the portal, the construction of portal to portal, time limitations indicates quite clearly that no tolling is permissible of the Section 255 two-year statute of limitations during the period of time that the Secretary is engaging in administrative investigation and conciliation functions under the Act.","start":1146.429,"stop":1178.729,"duration":32.3},{"text":"We have here the portal to portal time limitations assuming that we have what could be characterized here as a statute of limitations.
