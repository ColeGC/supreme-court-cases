petitioners.","start":110.236,"stop":116.776,"duration":6.54},{"text":"This case presents another facet of the problem which was before this Court in Florida Power decided in 1974.","start":116.776,"stop":127.247,"duration":10.47},{"text":"There the Court held that the union does not violate Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances by disciplining supervisor members for crossing a picket line to perform rank-and-file struck work during an economic strike against the employer.","start":127.247,"stop":159.254,"duration":32.01},{"text":"The question here is, whether a different conclusion is warranted where the supervisor members are disciplined or threatened with discipline for crossing the picket line to perform their normal supervisory duties, which includes grievance adjustment or collective bargaining.","start":159.254,"stop":178.379,"duration":19.13},{"text":"Now, the relevant facts are these.","start":178.379,"stop":183.223,"duration":4.84},{"text":"Respondent, Writers Guild represents for collective bargaining purposes, writers, who prepare scripts for a motion picture and television firms and who are employed by the major television Net broadcasting companies and by various member firms of the Association of Motion Picture of Producers.","start":183.223,"stop":205.027,"duration":21.8},{"text":"I refer to both of them as the employers.","start":205.027,"stop":209.344,"duration":4.32},{"text":"The employers also employ producers, directors and story editors to manage and carry out the production of the films.","start":209.344,"stop":222.877,"duration":13.53},{"text":"The producers, directors and story editors when acting as such, are supervisors as defined in Section 211 in the Act and they also represent the employers in the adjustment of grievances and in certain situations producers also represent the employers in collective bargaining.","start":222.877,"stop":246.867,"duration":23.99},{"text":"Some producers, directors and story editors, known as hyphenates and those are the people that we are going to be concerned with in this case, have writing capabilities and are at times employed as writers to prepare scripts or perform other creative writing functions.","start":246.867,"stop":268.532,"duration":21.66},{"text":"These hyphenates are members of the Guild.","start":268.532,"stop":272.219,"duration":3.69},{"text":"The Guild represents hyphenates only when they are employed as writers, not when they are employed as producers, directors or story editors.","start":272.219,"stop":285.27,"duration":13.05},{"text":"Most hyphenates have personal service contracts with the employers covering their employment as producers, directors or story editors and indeed, under these contracts, they are often represented by other labor organizations.","start":285.27,"stop":303.617,"duration":18.35},{"text":"Thus the collective bargaining agreements between the Guild and the employers provide that a person is not subject to those agreements when he is employed in a non-writing capacity, for example, as a producer, director or a story editor.","start":303.617,"stop":320.7,"duration":17.08},{"text":"The agreements further provide that producers, directors and story editors can perform certain editorial writing services known as “\"A through H\"” functions without becoming a writer subject to the agreements.","start":320.7,"stop":341.719,"duration":21.02},{"text":"Now, in March of 1973, the Guild began a strike against the employers in furtherance of their demands for new contracts covering writers.","start":341.719,"stop":352.344,"duration":10.63},{"text":"The strike continued against some employers until July of 1973.","start":352.344,"stop":357.8,"duration":5.46},{"text":"A month before the strike started, the Guild distributed strike rules to all union members, including the hyphenates.","start":357.8,"stop":365.562,"duration":7.76},{"text":"In addition to prohibiting writing for struck employers, the rules prohibited all members, regardless of the capacity in which they were working from crossing union picket lines.","start":365.562,"stop":378.999,"duration":13.44},{"text":"The strike rules also prohibited union members from working in the future with members who violated the strike rules.","start":378.999,"stop":387.887,"duration":8.89},{"text":"The Guild through a series of special meeting with hyphenate members and phone calls to particular hyphenates, emphasized that the strike rules would apply to hyphenates working in any capacity and that they would be subject to discipline and black listing if they cross the union’s picket lines.","start":387.887,"stop":410.486,"duration":22.6},{"text":"The Guild also refused to allow any members, including hyphenates to resign from membership before or during the strike.","start":410.486,"stop":421.696,"duration":11.21},{"text":"The employers demanded that the hyphenates continue, notwithstanding the strike in the picket lines to perform their duties other than as a writer under their personal service contracts.","start":421.696,"stop":436.499,"duration":14.8},{"text":"Many hyphenates crossed the picket lines to perform their normal supervisory and managerial functions as producers, directors and story editors, including grievance adjustment and collective bargaining.","start":436.499,"stop":450.691,"duration":14.19},{"text":"They performed no writing work, which would otherwise have been performed by the striking writers.","start":450.691,"stop":458.757,"duration":8.07},{"text":"During and after the strike, the Guild filed the internal union charges against 31 hyphenates for crossing the picket lines, 10 hyphenates were subsequently convicted by union trial committees.","start":458.757,"stop":472.281,"duration":13.52},{"text":"They were suspended or expelled from union membership and were fined amounts ranging from a $100.00 to $50,000.00.","start":472.281,"stop":480.825,"duration":8.54},{"text":"Later, the union membership voted to reduce the penalties of 9 of the convicted hyphenates and proceedings against other hyphenates were held in abeyance, pending the disposition of unfair labor practice charges which mean, were filed by the employers with the Board.","start":480.825,"stop":502.036,"duration":21.21},{"text":"The Board with member fanning dissenting concluded that the Guild violated Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act by disciplining and threatening to discipline the hyphenates for crossing the picket line to perform their normal supervisory duties and the a divided Court of Appeals agreeing with member offending the night enforcement of the Board’s order.","start":502.036,"stop":527.056,"duration":25.02},{"text":"Now, we start with Florida Power, which holds that a unions’ discipline of one of its members who is a supervisory employee can constitute a violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (B) only when that discipline may adversely affect the supervisors' conduct in performing the duties of and acting in his capacity as grievance suggester or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer.","start":527.056,"stop":557.762,"duration":30.71},{"text":"The discipline in Florida Power was found not to have this effect because the supervisors were disciplined for crossing the picket line to engage in rank-and-file struck work.","start":557.762,"stop":570.214,"duration":12.45},{"text":"Indeed the union did not discipline those supervisors who merely performed their supervisory duties when they crossed the picket line.","start":570.214,"stop":581.572,"duration":11.36},{"text":"The Board submits that when a supervisor member is threatened with discipline or discipline for crossing a picket line to perform his normal supervisory or management duties and they include grievance adjustment and collective bargaining, such discipline may adversely affect the supervisors’ conduct in performing the duties of grievance adjuster or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer, even though the union’s motive is not to influence a particular grievance or collective bargaining decision, but merely to secure adherence to its picket line.","start":581.572,"stop":631.075,"duration":49.5},{"text":"There are two reasons for this conclusion.","start":631.075,"stop":636.209,"duration":5.13},{"text":"One is referred to or can be called the deprivation theory and that is this, as the administrative law judge whose decision was adopted by the Board pointed out, if the hyphenates had succumbed to the Guilds’ threats of discipline as many of them did and had refused to cross the picket lines, the employers would have been deprived of their chosen representatives for the performance of management functions, including grievance adjustment or collective bargaining for the duration of the strike, no less and if the union had directly pressured the employers into removing those representatives from those duties.","start":636.209,"stop":688.653,"duration":52.44},{"text":"In short, the effect of the threat of discipline would have been to have deprived the employers of their chosen representatives for grievance adjustment and collective bargaining.","start":688.653,"stop":701.627,"duration":12.97}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Come, is it not reasonable to infer that the picket line itself may have had that effect?","start":701.627,"stop":707.226,"duration":5.6}]},{"speakerName":"Norton J. Come","textObjs":[{"text":"That is correct Your Honor.","start":707.226,"stop":709.315,"duration":2.09},{"text":"Where the picket line alone is in the picture and the supervisor decides that he is not going to cross that picket line, the employer is deprived of a selected representative because of the free decision of the supervisor to honor or not to honor that picket line.","start":709.315,"stop":733.842,"duration":24.53},{"text":"However, we submit that where the supervisor honors that picket line as a result of threats of union discipline, the element of restraint and coercion on the part of the union has been added and it is up to the union to disentangle that he would not have crossed, but for that restraint and coercion, and we submit that the union cannot do that.","start":733.842,"stop":763.573,"duration":29.73},{"text":"Moreover, as the Board added by the citation of its earlier decisions in Hammond Publisher and Triangle Publications in so far as those hyphenates who defied the union and were disciplined or concerned there is a reasonable likelihood that the discipline would have a carryover effect and affect the future performance of grievance adjustment and collective bargaining functions because hereon like the performance of rank-and-file struck work, which was involved in Florida Power, the duties, which the supervisors were performing, were similar to the functions that they would be performing absent the strike.","start":763.573,"stop":810.649,"duration":47.08},{"text":"I do not want to cut in any further to my colleague’s time.","start":810.649,"stop":815.358,"duration":4.71},{"text":"They will develop these theories in further detail.","start":815.358,"stop":832.633,"duration":17.28}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

Keaton","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":834.326,"stop":837.507,"duration":3.18},{"text":"In the time allotted to me, I would like to cover primarily two contentions in this case.","start":837.507,"stop":844.636,"duration":7.13},{"text":"The first one being the contention of the Guild, the respondent herein, that in some ways of work done by the hyphenates, whatever you might call it and they do not call it struck work in their briefs, they call it rank-and-file work without using the word struck, that in some ways, that work, put the work on a pie is a work that this Court held in Florida Power to be of the nature, the Section 8 (b) (1) (B) should not apply.","start":844.636,"stop":869.321,"duration":24.69},{"text":"The second point that I would like to address myself, is that, Mr. Come referred to as a deprivation theory in somewhat more detail.","start":869.321,"stop":876.599,"duration":7.28},{"text":"As to the first point that the three-throng argument being made by the Guild at this point.","start":876.599,"stop":882.687,"duration":6.09},{"text":"It comes down to this.","start":882.687,"stop":884.633,"duration":1.95},{"text":"Number one, while there concededly is no evidence in the court, that any writing of scripts was done by any of the people who were disciplined, they might have done writing.","start":884.633,"stop":898.541,"duration":13.91},{"text":"Number two, that the “\"A through H\"” functions are to be construed as bargaining unit type writing and number three, that even if the “\"A through H\"” functions are not bargaining unit writing, they are not managerial functions, and that therefore, the performance of such functions is not akin to grievance related type work, and therefore, the supervisors could be disciplined.","start":898.541,"stop":927.483,"duration":28.94},{"text":"Now, taking the first point, namely yes to whether or not they might have done the right thing, the fact of the matter is that the Guild very well knew or at least very well could find out, whether they were writing.","start":927.483,"stop":940.274,"duration":12.79},{"text":"There were 15 strike rules in this case, which provide specifically prohibition against writing.","start":940.274,"stop":947.437,"duration":7.16},{"text":"Not one of them was invoked by the Guild, not a single one.","start":947.437,"stop":951.707,"duration":4.27},{"text":"One of those rules, rule 8 is very significant because it specified that any writer in order to perfect himself and that includes of course rank-and-file writers, to protect themselves against future charges, should file with Guild his scripts that he had completed at the time of the strike in order to make quite sure that he will be able prove that he had not written during the strike.","start":951.707,"stop":976.624,"duration":24.92},{"text":"The respondent’s exhibit six which is not in the printed transcript which is a multi-colored script it is in the Court, will illustrate to the Court that it is very easy to tell from a script when the final script was written and when the changes were made, and therefore, it would have been quite easy for the Guild to tell whether or not that work was done.","start":976.624,"stop":995.655,"duration":19.03},{"text":"Now, turning to “\"A through H\",” the Guild analogizes in “\"A through H\"” to the Shelton Construction Company case, the Shelton Pipeline case, wherein the B representative was held not immune from discipline because he was offering equipment which he had also operated at times when there was a labor shortage, but that case is precisely the opposite from this case because in that collective bargaining agreement, operating equipment was covered by the contract, by so many words, and then the contract said, in the case of an emergency of the purposes of training, a supervisor may operate the equipment not so if you are “\"A through H\".”","start":995.655,"stop":1034.189,"duration":38.53},{"text":"The contract specifically states in sections 1 (b) (1) (A) and in 1 (c) (1) (A), that the performance of “\"A through H\"” functions by producers, directors or story supervisors, shall not be covered by this agreement and shall not cause them to become writers hereunder.","start":1034.189,"stop":1055.132,"duration":20.94},{"text":"So, what you really have is not collective bargaining unit work that may be done by supervisors, but work that is not covered by the contract which if you perform it, does not make you a bargaining unit employee, but which conceivably at times could be performed by bargaining unit employees.","start":1055.132,"stop":1070.192,"duration":15.06},{"text":"But now comes the most important point, namely the argument that “\"A through H\"” supposedly is not managerial.","start":1070.192,"stop":1075.265,"duration":5.07},{"text":"Let us examine what “\"A through H\"” is and if the Court please, I will give examples of it, some of them are in the record and some of them are just common sense.","start":1075.265,"stop":1082.854,"duration":7.59},{"text":"The first A says, cutting for time.","start":1082.854,"stop":1085.23,"duration":2.38},{"text":"Now, what does it mean?","start":1085.23,"stop":1086.369,"duration":1.14},{"text":"It means deleting a portion of a movie or a television play in order to make it shorter, in order to accommodate the time for the screen, that is certainly a managerial decision.","start":1086.369,"stop":1096.19,"duration":9.82},{"text":"B is bridging.","start":1096.19,"stop":1097.661,"duration":1.47},{"text":"That means, tying up two pieces of the movie, if you will, due to the elimination of the intervening piece.","start":1097.661,"stop":1105.195,"duration":7.53},{"text":"C is a change in technical or stage
