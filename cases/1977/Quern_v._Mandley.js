Education and Welfare also a defendant in this case.","start":75.514,"stop":84.706,"duration":9.19},{"text":"He will argue the balance of the time and specifically address the subjects of the basic statutory scheme underlying the AFDC and Emergency Assistance Programs.","start":84.706,"stop":97.22,"duration":12.51},{"text":"He will distinguish the two programs, one from the other and he will argue why the Social Security Act does not impose mandatory eligibility requirements on the state in that regard and he will establish why after, the first Mandley decision in this case, the first Mandley decision, the case became moot.","start":97.22,"stop":122.153,"duration":24.93},{"text":"This case arose when the plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that the Illinois Emergency Assistance Program violated Section 606 (e) of the Social Security Act under which Illinois operated the program.","start":122.153,"stop":139.499,"duration":17.35},{"text":"The Illinois Plan for Emergency

homelessness due to partial damage of the structure, and the court ordered evictions, except for the non payment of rent and there was a provision for ADC applicants who had not yet obtained eligibility or have been established eligible that they could have food, clothing, household goods, and equipment.","start":153.743,"stop":181.779,"duration":28.04},{"text":"The plaintiffs’

children.","start":181.779,"stop":202.103,"duration":20.32},{"text":"The plaintiffs in the case, the individuals were persons who had applied for and had been denied emergency assistance in that their particular need was not one of those met by the criterion that I mentioned a few moments ago.","start":202.103,"stop":221.495,"duration":19.39},{"text":"These attacks were all principally made in Count 1 of the complaint.","start":221.495,"stop":226.271,"duration":4.78},{"text":"Count 2 then went on to address allegations that the Illinois Plan violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause because it did not provide emergency assistance to all persons facing destitution.","start":226.271,"stop":243.051,"duration":16.78},{"text":"The District Court had found for the State defendants and for the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, that is, it did not find a violation of the Supremacy Clause and it did in fact find that the Illinois Plan created under 606 (e) did not violate 606 (e) of the Social Security Act.","start":243.051,"stop":263.334,"duration":20.28},{"text":"The plaintiffs appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed the District Court and found that the Illinois Plan more narrowly defined eligibility than is permitted in the court’s opinion under 606 (e) of the Social security Act.","start":263.334,"stop":284.65,"duration":21.32},{"text":"This has been referred to as the Mandley I decision because there was a second appeal which I will address in a

holding.","start":291.437,"stop":300.094,"duration":8.66},{"text":"The defendants then made a motion to dismiss the case as moot for the reason that the State of Illinois had withdrawn its Emergency Assistance Program under Section 606 (e), and instead, opted to operate an Emergency Needs Program under the regular AFDC Special Needs Program.","start":300.094,"stop":335.07,"duration":34.98},{"text":"The plaintiffs’ answer to that motion said that Illinois was continuing to operate its Emergency Assistance Program and not under Section 606 (e), but under Section 402 and of course, it is correct that Illinois was operating a program of emergency assistance under its ADC Provisions.","start":335.07,"stop":357.107,"duration":22.04},{"text":"The District Court offered the plaintiff ample opportunity to amend its complaint and address the new program under Section 402 of the Social Security Act.","start":357.107,"stop":372.546,"duration":15.44},{"text":"The plaintiffs refused to amend its complaint and some months later the District Court granted the defendants’ motion and dismissed the case as moot.","start":372.546,"stop":391.696,"duration":19.15},{"text":"The plaintiffs again appealed to the Seventh Circuit and the Court of Appeals, again having a second opportunity at this case, concluded that the District Court erred, the case was not moot and most importantly, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that 606 (e) is now the exclusive statutory channel to receive federal reimbursement for the operation of an Emergency Assistance Program.","start":391.696,"stop":427.296,"duration":35.6},{"text":"Again, the decision was sent to the District Court and the court entered an order that was offered.","start":427.296,"stop":438.756,"duration":11.46},{"text":"The state and the Secretary filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which was granted.","start":438.756,"stop":448.203,"duration":9.45},{"text":"The results of the Seventh Circuit holding in Mandley II is that states now can only look to Section 606 (e) of the Social Security Act to operate an Emergency Assistance Program for needy children.","start":448.203,"stop":470.398,"duration":22.2},{"text":"It is the position of the State of Illinois that there is no support anywhere in the Act, in the legislative history, in the administrative interpretation of the decisions of the Act or the decisions of this court that support the holding of the Seventh Circuit, and in fact what is available, suggests just the opposite conclusion.","start":470.398,"stop":498.768,"duration":28.37},{"text":"That 606 is not the exclusive mechanism for the operation of emergency systems program.","start":498.768,"stop":506.971,"duration":8.2},{"text":"The Social Security Act establishes the basic framework of supporting the operation of the AFDC Program by the states and the regulations of the Secretary, perhaps as far back as 1949, recognized and authorized a Special Needs Program under the conventional AFDC Program operated by the states.","start":506.971,"stop":537.325,"duration":30.35},{"text":"Specifically, I would draw the Court’s attention to Section 23-233.20 of the Code of Federal Regulations, if you will look in the yellow copy which is the original brief of the state petitioners on A9, you will see the language quoting, this is 233.20a25, if the state agency includes special need items in its standard,

recipients requiring them.","start":537.325,"stop":591.776,"duration":54.45},{"text":"Now, this is the Secretary’s acknowledgment that special need items are permissible under the regular AFDC Program
