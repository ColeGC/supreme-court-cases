Labor Relations Board to resolve these kinds of issues.","start":359.205,"stop":371.041,"duration":11.84},{"text":"In many respects the type of resolution that occurred in this case on a motion for an

Sears had called the Sheriff and had the pickets arrested for trespass or for some other act, the state court would ultimately and I don't think there would be an issue that it would have jurisdiction to do so, resolve the criminal case and in so doing would have to consider not only the elements of state law that were involved in the particular crime but would also become involved in -- but undoubtedly be a defense and that is that the activity on the property was not some way privileged or protected by the National Labor Relations Act.","start":383.601,"stop":412.969,"duration":29.37},{"text":"Same thing would be true for example, if in the process of ejecting a union representative from the property, there was a lawsuit

protected.","start":423.221,"stop":438.366,"duration":15.14},{"text":"Viewed in that context, the type of issues that the state court would resolve on an injunction motion are no different than those issues which very clearly and as to which there is no argument, the state court already has jurisdiction, even though the matter may have originated out of a labor dispute at some time.","start":438.366,"stop":456.349,"duration":17.98},{"text":"Under Garmon, if we view this in the context the backdrop of state law, these are the kinds of issues that state courts have been resolving, since before there were states in effect, going back to the very earliest common law actions involving trespass.","start":456.349,"stop":474.783,"duration":18.43},{"text":"The advantage of allowing the state court to resolve this type of dispute is of course that it channels the dispute into a neutral form avoiding the necessity of self help.","start":474.783,"stop":488.666,"duration":13.88},{"text":"The court would be very concerned that should self-help be exercised that that could very quickly lead to an active violence.","start":488.666,"stop":499.112,"duration":10.45},{"text":"There is no issue under the current state of the law that the ejector could use (Inaudible).","start":499.112,"stop":505.239,"duration":6.13},{"text":"That has been suggested by many of the commentators, and it has been mentioned in decisions of this court.","start":505.239,"stop":509.542,"duration":4.3},{"text":"If in fact one could use self-help to affect the removal of pickets from the premises and thereby channel the dispute at least as to the criminal aspects or the tort aspects of the case in to the state court, it seems illogical not to allow Sears in this particular circumstance, property owner to go into state court initially to have that dispute resolved without the necessity of exercising self-help.","start":509.542,"stop":540.128,"duration":30.59},{"text":"The significance or the benefit of state court in this particular circumstance, I think is very obvious under the act for two reasons.","start":540.128,"stop":549.334,"duration":9.21},{"text":"First, under the particular factual circumstances under which this case arose, there was no availability of any NLRB relief.","start":549.334,"stop":560.427,"duration":11.09},{"text":"Since Sears was not challenging the objective of the picketing, merely its location, there was no way that Sears initially obtain a forum before the board to resolve this dispute but even if there were some procedure for doing that, at best, the board might at sometime find that in fact the union activity on Sears premises was not protected.","start":560.427,"stop":582.593,"duration":22.17},{"text":"Sears, at that point would simply have to go into court to enforce the board orders since the board order is not self executing and would be right back where we were fighting it out in a court at some later time rather than at some earlier that at least would have the advantage of placing the issues at peace between the parties without exercising self-help.","start":582.593,"stop":603.285,"duration":20.69},{"text":"If this proceeding for example, had gotten back into the California State Courts or to a Federal District Court to enforce a board order, the board -- rather the court would not of course necessarily be bound by the NLRB decision.","start":603.285,"stop":617.74,"duration":14.46},{"text":"There might be other issues that would have to be raised either under state law or federal law.","start":617.74,"stop":623.319,"duration":5.58},{"text":"One would hope that the court would give due deference to the board decision but the fact of the matter is that a determination of the board on and on for a labor practice charge is not res judicata or collateral estoppel in a subsequent precision.","start":623.319,"stop":638.091,"duration":14.77},{"text":"So neither from terms of an access to a forum nor if they were a forum is a proceeding before the board and a remedy, an effective remedy where the circumstances involved location of the picketing rather than its objective.","start":638.091,"stop":657.634,"duration":19.54}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What if 30 days have gone by before Sears
