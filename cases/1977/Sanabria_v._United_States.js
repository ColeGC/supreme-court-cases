certiorari to the First Circuit which partially vacated a judgment of acquittal entered in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.","start":99.134,"stop":117.078,"duration":17.94},{"text":"The case presents a double jeopardy issue which arises in this way.","start":117.078,"stop":122.534,"duration":5.46},{"text":"In November of 1971, there were a series of raids so-called around the suburban communities of Boston, pursuant to search warrants directed to suspected bookmaking establishments.","start":122.534,"stop":137.832,"duration":15.3},{"text":"The warrants were issued as the result of a series of wiretaps authorized by the District Court which have been conducted since the previous June.","start":137.832,"stop":148.486,"duration":10.65},{"text":"For some reason, and I do not know the reason, it was not until 10 months later in September 1972 that an indictment was returned.","start":148.486,"stop":158.208,"duration":9.72},{"text":"In this particular indictment, the one now before you, 16 persons were indicted and, eventually, 11 were tried of whom one was the petitioner, Sanabria.","start":158.208,"stop":169.799,"duration":11.59},{"text":"It was a one-count indictment charging a violation of Title 18 United States Code Section 1955 which, as you know, is the so-called Bookie Syndicate Act.","start":169.799,"stop":185.142,"duration":15.34},{"text":"About a month after the indictment was returned, the Fourth Circuit announced this decision in Giordano which you might recall was the case that held that a wiretap was invalid if its application for it had been authorized by a person other than the Attorney General or the specially designated assistant as required by the statute.","start":185.142,"stop":211.997,"duration":26.86},{"text":"Then, this court granted certiorari in Giordano.","start":211.997,"stop":215.919,"duration":3.92},{"text":"In the spring of 1973, by agreement among all the parties including the government and the defendants, the case was allowed to lay dormant pending your decision in Giordano.","start":215.919,"stop":227.963,"duration":12.04},{"text":"I give you this history because there is some suggestion in the government’s brief and in the record that, for three or four or five years, defense counsel was finding ways to attack the indictment.","start":227.963,"stop":241.64,"duration":13.68},{"text":"The case was essentially dormant for a very good part of the time.","start":241.64,"stop":245.984,"duration":4.34},{"text":"Eventually, in mid-1974 I believe, this court upheld Giordano.","start":245.984,"stop":255.087,"duration":9.1},{"text":"As a result, many, many of the indictments that have resulted from the raids were dismissed and this was one of the few surviving indictments, if not the only one.","start":255.087,"stop":266.014,"duration":10.93},{"text":"It became immediately apparent to defense counsel that unless we could find some other basis for a Fourth Amendment attack, there was simply no defense for these defendants.","start":266.014,"stop":278.282,"duration":12.27},{"text":"There was just a ton of evidence, if all the bookmaking slips and wiretaps were going to get into evidence.","start":278.282,"stop":289.7,"duration":11.42},{"text":"We did come up with some other Fourth Amendment grounds but the District Court did not see it that way, nor did the Court of Appeals.","start":289.7,"stop":297.508,"duration":7.81},{"text":"Interestingly enough, we filed a petition for certiorari here which was held by you over the summer and denied just last September under the name of Plotkin, petitioner, I believe against the United States.","start":297.508,"stop":313.34,"duration":15.83},{"text":"These were the 10 defendants who were convicted.","start":313.34,"stop":316.317,"duration":2.98},{"text":"Sanabria was the 11th and he was acquitted.","start":316.317,"stop":320.057,"duration":3.74},{"text":"I am jumping ahead in time.","start":320.057,"stop":324.243,"duration":4.19},{"text":"After the Trial Court denied our motion to suppress the evidence, we realized that the trial was going to be simply an exercise in the protection of the defendants’ rights.","start":324.243,"stop":339.591,"duration":15.35},{"text":"Shortly before the trial began, we began casting around for some kind of defense to put on some kind of plausible defense at the trial.","start":339.591,"stop":349.595,"duration":10},{"text":"Of course, the place to begin is with the statute.","start":349.595,"stop":353.523,"duration":3.93},{"text":"The statute, if you recall, prohibits willfully conducting a gambling business that has to meet three criteria.","start":353.523,"stop":362.721,"duration":9.2},{"text":"First of all, the violation of the gambling business must constitute a violation of state law.","start":362.721,"stop":369.858,"duration":7.14},{"text":"Second, it must involve five or more persons.","start":369.858,"stop":373.746,"duration":3.89},{"text":"Thirdly, it must be large.","start":373.746,"stop":375.296,"duration":1.55},{"text":"It must be in operation more than 30 days or receive a gross revenue of more than $2,000 in any single day.","start":375.296,"stop":385.637,"duration":10.34},{"text":"An essential element of the offense was to prove that the gambling law alleged in the indictment violated state law.","start":385.637,"stop":393.086,"duration":7.45},{"text":"The indictment particularized as the violation of state law, Section 17 of Chapter 271.","start":393.086,"stop":400.751,"duration":7.66},{"text":"That Section of the Massachusetts General Laws is directed to games like horse races, political election, boxing matches, but not to lottery, the numbers games so-called.","start":400.751,"stop":413.404,"duration":12.65},{"text":"Thus, the government had to prove or we thought they had to prove that the business that was being alleged was one that was in violation of Section 17.","start":413.404,"stop":426.417,"duration":13.01},{"text":"That is a non-numbers type of game.","start":426.417,"stop":430.496,"duration":4.08},{"text":"At the close of the government’s case when it put Section 17 into evidence, by way of asking the court to take judicial notice of it, we made what I might charitably call a somewhat specious argument.","start":430.496,"stop":445.744,"duration":15.25},{"text":"Because the indictment described the business as one of registering bets which is not, technically speaking, a crime under Massachusetts law, the crime is being found in a place with apparatus for registering bets.","start":445.744,"stop":460.077,"duration":14.33},{"text":"But, because the indictment described the business as one for registering bets and because it described the gambling business as including a numbers operation and the numbers operation was not a crime under Section 17 which was specified in the indictment, we moved for a judgment of acquittal.","start":460.077,"stop":478.247,"duration":18.17},{"text":"As I say, the motion was completely unsound.","start":478.247,"stop":484.825,"duration":6.58},{"text":"We took a wild shot and the District Court was not buying it.","start":484.825,"stop":489.935,"duration":5.11},{"text":"At the Appendix at page 7, you will find the District Court holding that the indictment was not effective in denying the judgment of acquittal on that basis.","start":489.935,"stop":499.898,"duration":9.96}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"Am I correct that, so far, you admit that
