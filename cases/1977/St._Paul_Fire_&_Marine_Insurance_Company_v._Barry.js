problems of course, and availability of malpractice.","start":729.354,"stop":739.65,"duration":10.3},{"text":"The First Circuit however held that these plaintiffs could maintain a suit because they

insurance companies and agents.","start":922.048,"stop":927.908,"duration":5.86},{"text":"In the case of insurance companies, one of the principle ways was to refuse to reinsure their risk and this

agent, they had something called the separation and they said to the agent, if you handle the product of a price-cutter, we are going to put you out of business because we are not going to sell you any insurance.","start":941.415,"stop":952.871,"duration":11.46},{"text":"Another way, they dealt with this was they sold fire insurance and allied lines and they said to the consumer, “If you deal

must have meant by boycott, coercion, and intimidation.","start":976.029,"stop":989.345,"duration":13.32},{"text":"And I would like to draw a line, if I could on the one hand, you have the question of the policy of competition.","start":989.345,"stop":996.521,"duration":7.18},{"text":"That is what the Sherman Act and the Anti- Trust laws are all about.","start":996.521,"stop":1001.216,"duration":4.7},{"text":"To enfoster competition between companies and if under the Sherman Act, that there were no McCarran Act, companies getting together and

boycott section, it said one thing was different.","start":1042.214,"stop":1046.963,"duration":4.75},{"text":"That is, it is one thing for people not to compete with one anther and for the state

between.","start":1046.963,"stop":1063.954,"duration":16.99},{"text":"It is another thing for the private companies to take it into their own hands to say that those who do want to compete and are

compete.","start":1063.954,"stop":1082.571,"duration":18.62},{"text":"In short, a boycott, coercion, and intimidation, however you use those phrases whether separately or singly, is a kind of penal
