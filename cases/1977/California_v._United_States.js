Court.","start":83.115,"stop":89.809,"duration":6.69},{"text":"First, did Congress in fact, in 1902, establish a principle of state control of water, did Congress actually give that power to the states?","start":89.809,"stop":99.917,"duration":10.11},{"text":"Secondly, if it did, how do we reconcile that principle with the many substantive Congressional policies that Congress has enacted in

Secretary of the Interior to carry out the substantive Congressional policies?","start":119.912,"stop":132.309,"duration":12.4},{"text":"Now, let me turn to the facts of the case.","start":132.309,"stop":134.007,"duration":1.7},{"text":"The Reclamation Act of 1902 essentially provides for federal construction and operation of reclamation facilities in about 17 western states.","start":134.007,"stop":143.478,"duration":9.47},{"text":"Under the authority of that Act, Congress has authorized a number of reclamation facilities in California that are collectively known

permits.","start":173.821,"stop":178.259,"duration":4.44},{"text":"In fact, since 1927 the State Board had issued 12 major decisions that result in the issuance of conditional permits to the Bureau of Reclamation.","start":178.259,"stop":189.044,"duration":10.79},{"text":"Then, in 1973, the United States filed its present action for declaratory judgment.","start":189.044,"stop":194.506,"duration":5.46},{"text":"In this action, it asked the court to determine that the Bureau of Reclamation need not comply with California’s appropriation

contrast, argues that California has a qualified power to impose conditions.","start":254.825,"stop":261.264,"duration":6.44},{"text":"It argues that it can impose conditions if those conditions do not impair or interfere with the basic Congressionally authorized purposes of federal reclamation projects.","start":261.264,"stop":272.219,"duration":10.95},{"text":"The lower court upheld the position of the United States.","start":272.219,"stop":275.112,"duration":2.89},{"text":"It held that the State Board is without power to impose conditions under any and all circumstances, that there is not circumstance where such a condition can be imposed upon an appropriate permit issued to the Bureau.","start":275.112,"stop":286.144,"duration":11.03},{"text":"On that basis, the court granted summary judgment for the United States.","start":286.144,"stop":290.4,"duration":4.26},{"text":"The court did not reach the question whether the conditions of Decision 1422 or for that matter any other decision issued by the State Board, in fact, conflict with any Congressionally authorized purposes of the project.","start":290.4,"stop":303.119,"duration":12.72},{"text":"It avoided that
