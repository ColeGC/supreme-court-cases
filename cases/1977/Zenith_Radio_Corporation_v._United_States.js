Court.","start":22.142,"stop":25.867,"duration":3.73},{"text":"This case presents the question whether the forgiveness of a commodity tax on the exportation of certain consumer electronic products from Japan is a bounty or grant under our countervailing duty law.","start":25.867,"stop":39.875,"duration":14.01},{"text":"The petitioner is a domestic producer of such consumer electronic products as television sets, radios and the like.","start":39.875,"stop":47.356,"duration":7.48},{"text":"In 1970, the petitioner filed a complaint with the Treasury Department, claiming that Japan conferred a bounty or grant upon the exportation of like products by reason of the remission of a commodity tax on exportation.","start":47.356,"stop":65.11,"duration":17.75},{"text":"In January of 1976, the Secretary of the Treasury made a determination that no bounty or grant was paid or bestowed on exportation.","start":65.11,"stop":75.757,"duration":10.65},{"text":"Under a then recently enacted statute, the petitioner sought and obtained judicial review over the secretary?s negative determination in the United States Customs Court.","start":75.757,"stop":88.863,"duration":13.11},{"text":"From the pleadings filed by the parties in the Court, it became clear that the essential facts were not in dispute.","start":88.863,"stop":96.275,"duration":7.41},{"text":"Japan imposes a commodity tax on certain products when shipped from the manufacturer?s factory for domestic consumption, that is consumption in Japan, however, the same products when shipped for export from Japan are exempt from payment of the commodity tax.","start":96.275,"stop":116.01,"duration":19.74},{"text":"Each of the parties moved for summary judgment.","start":116.01,"stop":119.5,"duration":3.49},{"text":"Petitioner arguing that as a matter of law, the remission of the tax on exportation constituted a bounty or grant, the government arguing the contrary.","start":119.5,"stop":131.278,"duration":11.78},{"text":"A three-judge panel of the Customs Court agreed with the petitioner and awarded a summary judgment.","start":131.278,"stop":136.666,"duration":5.39},{"text":"On appeal, the Court of Customs on Patent Appeals, reversed in a 3 to 2 decision and on February of this year, this Court granted certiorari.","start":136.666,"stop":146.51,"duration":9.84},{"text":"We say, Your Honors, that the tax remission clearly is a bounty or grant on exportation and that off setting duties called countervailing duties, should be assessed on imported products from Japan which benefit from the tax remission.","start":146.51,"stop":162.526,"duration":16.02},{"text":"The Countervailing Duty Law as it now exists has remained essentially unchanged since the first general countervailing duty law was enacted as Section 5 of the Tariff Act of 1897.","start":162.526,"stop":176.319,"duration":13.79},{"text":"Since that time the law was re-enacted five times and it was twice construed by this Court in the Downs case and in the Nicholas case.","start":176.319,"stop":186.999,"duration":10.68},{"text":"Both decisions make clear that the statute?s coverage is extremely broad and particularly with respect to the remission of tax and exportation that that event is a bounty or grant.","start":186.999,"stop":203.086,"duration":16.09},{"text":"In Downs, the first of the two of countervailing duty cases considered by this Court, the Court had before it a very complex Russian program which sought to control the production, price and exportation of sugar.","start":203.086,"stop":218.92,"duration":15.83},{"text":"The scheme was extremely complicated, but it included two facts which this Court considered most important.","start":218.92,"stop":229.094,"duration":10.17},{"text":"Fact number one, all sugar sold domestically was subject to an excise tax.","start":229.094,"stop":235.705,"duration":6.61},{"text":"Fact number two, all sugar exported from Russia was exported free of such tax.","start":235.705,"stop":244.631,"duration":8.93},{"text":"The Court proceeded to state that whenever a tax is imposed upon all sugar produced, but is remitted on all sugar exported then by whatever process or in whatever manner or under whatever name it is disguised, it is a bounty upon exportation.","start":244.631,"stop":265.984,"duration":21.35},{"text":"Now, it is true there was another aspect of the Russian plan which the Court considered.","start":265.984,"stop":272.147,"duration":6.16},{"text":"Exporters of sugar received certificates which were marketable and valuable.","start":272.147,"stop":278.291,"duration":6.14},{"text":"The Court discussed whether or not these certificates also constituted a bounty or grant.","start":278.291,"stop":286.24,"duration":7.95},{"text":"The Court said that it did, but that does not detract from the Court?s very forceful language that the principle and the key facts in the entire scheme were the two that I mentioned to Your Honors, that all sugar sold in the home market was taxed and that all sugar exported was sold free of tax.","start":286.24,"stop":305.237,"duration":19},{"text":"This language of this Court declaring that the remission of tax under such circumstances is a bounty or grant, requiring the imposition of countervailing duties is not or was not unguarded language as the government would characterize it.","start":305.237,"stop":322.265,"duration":17.03},{"text":"That language is consistent with repeated statements of this Court, both in the Downs case and in cases subsequent to and prior to Downs.","start":322.265,"stop":332.734,"duration":10.47},{"text":"In the Nicholas case, the only other countervailing duty case this Court cited as an example of a bounty or grant on exportation, the remission of the tax when that tax is levied on products sold in the home market.","start":332.734,"stop":345.538,"duration":12.8},{"text":"In an earlier case, in Passevant, the Court expressed its recognition as to why governments remit taxes on exportation.","start":345.538,"stop":356.074,"duration":10.54},{"text":"The Court said, ?Doubtless, to encourage exportation, to encourage the introduction of domestic goods into export markets, taxes are remitted on exportation.","start":356.074,"stop":367.843,"duration":11.77},{"text":"There was no mystery about the benefits of tax remission on exportation.","start":367.843,"stop":373.743,"duration":5.9},{"text":"The Court perceived the benefit and the Court deemed such a benefit to be a countervailable bounty or grant.","start":373.743,"stop":381.21,"duration":7.47},{"text":"Notwithstanding the teachings of this Court which are quite clear, the Secretary of the Treasury has developed a practice under the countervailing duty law of excusing from countervail remissions of indirect tax.","start":381.21,"stop":401.971,"duration":20.76},{"text":"The practice unquestionably conflicts with decisions of this Court.","start":401.971,"stop":407.472,"duration":5.5},{"text":"Now, as I said earlier, the Congress re-enacted the statute five times since 1897 and it re-enacted it several times after this Court?s Downs decision and after this Court?s Nicholas decision.","start":407.472,"stop":421.933,"duration":14.46},{"text":"Of course, the Congress re-enacted the statute after the administrative practice began to be put into place.","start":421.933,"stop":430.174,"duration":8.24},{"text":"A fundamental question arises, by re-enactment of the statute after this Court?s decision and after the administrative practice of the Secretary, what did Congress have in mind?","start":430.174,"stop":441.882,"duration":11.71},{"text":"Did Congress intend to ratify the practice or did Congress intend to ratify this Court?s decisions?","start":441.882,"stop":447.866,"duration":5.98},{"text":"The question is so simple

community understands this to be the construction of our statute and indeed in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an acronym pronounced GATT, the agreement which we have entered into through the executive to the branch of the government because the Congress has not specifically set forth that the non excessive remission of a consumption tax or an excise tax that this Japanese community tax as my brother would agree is, is not the grant of a bounty or subsidy that would trigger the imposition of countervailing duties which all of the subscribers to the General Agreement on Tariffs

require this Court to the rule to the contrary, we did not have an excessive remission of an excise tax simplicitor, we have there instead the remission of the tax and the bestowing of a certificate which was the matter of great economic value and as the colloquy between the Court and my brother developed and demonstrated, the amount of the duty that was countervailed was either the value of that certificate or a profit derived from the exercise of that certificate and was not in the amount of a excise tax that was remitted.","start":942.126,"stop":1017.27,"duration":75.14},{"text":"Also my
