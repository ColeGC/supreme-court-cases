Court decides that President Truman did indeed include the waters and submerged lands within one mile in it's proclamation, it must ten decide the second issue presented by this case, i.e. did the

occupied by claim of right.","start":185.406,"stop":212.938,"duration":27.53},{"text":"As to the first issue, the primary dispute between the parties centers on what President Truman meant by the word

islands.","start":320.409,"stop":341.213,"duration":20.8},{"text":"Federal officials and naturalists agree that federal jurisdiction should extend into the water, but at that time, California and the

California so that the three-mile question at issue involve these islands.","start":341.213,"stop":365.596,"duration":24.38},{"text":"In view of the conflicting claims that were then before the
