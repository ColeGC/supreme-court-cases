Frisch","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":39.349,"stop":42.345,"duration":3},{"text":"The issue presented by this case is whether a fine or requirement of restitution may be imposed upon one sentence to probation under the terms of the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 United States Code Section 5010 (a).","start":42.345,"stop":55.768,"duration":13.42},{"text":"Each petitioner entered a pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of federal law before United States Magistrate in Maryland and each was placed on probation under the terms of the Youth Act.","start":55.768,"stop":65.363,"duration":9.59},{"text":"Petitioner Rice being sentenced under the terms of that Act which extends it to young adult offenders.","start":65.363,"stop":70.342,"duration":4.98},{"text":"Each was ordered to pay a fine to the United States and additionally petitioner Durst was ordered to make restitution on a stolen check.","start":70.342,"stop":77.609,"duration":7.27},{"text":"The District Court in this case and the other lower federal courts which have held fines to be permissible under the Youth Act have essentially relied upon two sections of the statute and inferred these two sections a congressional intent to permit fines.","start":77.609,"stop":93.676,"duration":16.07},{"text":"The first of these sections is Section 5023 (a) of Title 18 which in effect incorporates the indult probation statute Section 3651 of Title 18 into the Youth Act, and the courts have reasoned that since fines are a permissible condition of probation for adults, they are also permissible under the Youth Act.","start":93.676,"stop":112.913,"duration":19.24},{"text":"What we respectfully suggest that this argument ignores is that the power to impose a fine does not originate with Section 3651, rather it originates with the substantive statute under which a person is convicted.","start":112.913,"stop":125.214,"duration":12.3},{"text":"We respectfully suggested the Court that when one is sentenced under the Youth Act, once a finding of benefit is made under that Act, once one is deemed to be worthy of the treatment and rehabilitation provided for by that Act, they are no longer punished for the offense.","start":125.214,"stop":138.354,"duration":13.14},{"text":"As provided for by Rule 3651, rather they are made subject to the treatment and rehabilitation of the Act, and as a result of that we suggest that reference to 3651 which can not be read as a penalty provision within itself, can in now way be read in such a way as to permit fines under the Youth Act.","start":138.354,"stop":156.25,"duration":17.9},{"text":"Now the question might naturally arise what was the purpose of enacting 5023 (a) by Congress if it were not to impose fines.","start":156.25,"stop":164,"duration":7.75},{"text":"Unfortunately the legislative history with regard to the Act is not really very helpful in this regard.","start":164,"stop":170.193,"duration":6.19},{"text":"There are perhaps, however, a number of reasons why 5023 may have been enacted rather than to permit fines.","start":170.193,"stop":176.892,"duration":6.7},{"text":"I think perhaps the best of these reasons has to do with the nature of the Youth Act itself.","start":176.892,"stop":181.794,"duration":4.9},{"text":"Congress knew when it enacted the Youth Act that it did not create any specialized programs of treatment and rehabilitation for Youth Act probationers as oppose to those sentenced under the imprisonment provisions of 5010 (b).","start":181.794,"stop":196.02,"duration":14.23},{"text":"Realizing that, Congress made it quite clear by enacting 5023 (a) that whatever programs of treatment and rehabilitation were available to adults under 3651 are made equally available to Youth offenders by the operation of 5023 (a).","start":196.02,"stop":212.469,"duration":16.45},{"text":"Additionally, the argument has been made and adopted number of judges in the District Court of Maryland that as a result of the operations of 5023 (a) and the incorporation of the general probation statute that a split sentence can be imposed under the Youth Act that is to say a sentence of imprisonment of up to six month to be followed by a period of probation.","start":212.469,"stop":232.035,"duration":19.57},{"text":"By doing this it gives a court in fact a middle ground between 5010 (a) and 5010 (b) without requiring the indeterminate sentence of up to four years.","start":232.035,"stop":242.762,"duration":10.73},{"text":"Additionally, a fair reading of 3651 which we suggest to this Court demonstrates that intent to fine does not exist fairly clearly, absolutely clearly sets out that restitution is permissible under the Youth Act and we are prepared to concede at this time.","start":242.762,"stop":261.058,"duration":18.3},{"text":"It is quite clear under 3651 that restitution is a permissible condition of probation.","start":261.058,"stop":266.292,"duration":5.23},{"text":"The second section of the statute that the courts have relied upon in order to permit fines under the Youth Act is in fact changed in the original language, the proposed language of 5010 (b) which originally read that imprisonment under Youth Act was in lieu.","start":266.292,"stop":281.16,"duration":14.87},{"text":"Penalty otherwise provided by law, and this was changed in the present form of the law to penalty of imprisonment.","start":281.16,"stop":288.525,"duration":7.36},{"text":"There is a letter cited in the Government’s brief in support to the proposition that this permits fines.","start":288.525,"stop":293.673,"duration":5.15},{"text":"In response to that we would make two argument to the Court: First and most importantly, 5010 (b) is not the issue before this Court.","start":293.673,"stop":301.052,"duration":7.38},{"text":"That is a separate and distinct sentencing alternative from 5010 (a) and not the one for decision in this case.","start":301.052,"stop":308.274,"duration":7.22},{"text":"As Mr. Chief Justice Burger in Dorszynski stated at Page 43, the Act creates two new sentencing alternatives, and the one before this Court is the probation alternative and not the incarceration alternative.","start":308.274,"stop":317.036,"duration":8.76}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood
