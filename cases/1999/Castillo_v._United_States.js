reasonable minds could conclude only that it would be interpreted in the more stringent way, because that was not the way it was ever interpreted up until this case, and the general rule is that when there's two interpretations, and when the one interpretation raises the constitutional doubt, and is also the more stringent interpretation, then the rule of lenity also applies.","start":502.197,"stop":534.668,"duration":32.47},{"text":"So when Congress enacted this, there's nothing in the legislative record, although we think that legislative history is a... not something that overcomes the doctrine of constitutional doubt or the rule of lenity, but when you actually look at the legislative history, it does not state that these are sentencing factors and not offense elements.","start":534.668,"stop":562.402,"duration":27.73},{"text":"You simply have references to the fact that these are mandatory sentences.","start":562.402,"stop":568.037,"duration":5.63},{"text":"The provision as adopted in 1968 had mandatory... a mandatory sentence for carrying and use of a firearm, and with the 1986 amendment you have a mandatory sentence for machineguns and firearms equipped with silencers, and then over the years you have other amendments which put in short-barrel shotguns and rifles, and destructive devices, and there simply was no legislative history... you'll see two paragraphs of legislative history in the Fifth Circuit opinion, and it in no way makes clear that these are offense elements.","start":568.037,"stop":605.145,"duration":37.11},{"text":"The statute is written in a way such that there are 83 words in the first clause which gives the offense elements, and in a very concise way it doesn't repeat all of the Federal jurisdictional nexus.","start":605.145,"stop":623.69,"duration":18.55},{"text":"It does not... it's not redundant in other words, and it was set forth in a way that there was never any question in the... either in the legislative history or in the way that this law was administered in the Federal courts up until this case was decided that indicated in any way that the firearm types are not offense elements.","start":623.69,"stop":649.322,"duration":25.63},{"text":"We think that by making the jury in essence a lower level gatekeeper which finds facts resulting in a 5-year period of incarceration, and then giving it to the sentencing judge to find by a mere preponderance, that those do implicate the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the Indictment Clause of the Fifth Amendment as well as the Due Process Clause and the right to jury trial and the right to be informed of the nature of the accusation in the Sixth Amendment, and by interpreting the law to mean that these are offense elements, there is no constitutional doubt.","start":649.322,"stop":692.167,"duration":42.85},{"text":"That resolves the constitutional doubt against an interpretation that raises that issue.","start":692.167,"stop":696.802,"duration":4.63},{"text":"If you want to go back in history, this long tradition of both Federal and State law under which these are offense elements, as far as Federal law goes we go back to the National Firearms Act of 1934, and for the first time Congress made it unlawful to possess or to receive unregistered machineguns and the short-barreled shotguns and some other types of firearms, and it was an offense element then.","start":696.802,"stop":725.071,"duration":28.27},{"text":"In the 1968 act, there are various offenses under title I of the act related to machineguns, short-barreled shotguns and other... and destructive devices, and those are invariably elements of the offense, and so if we were to take respondent's position we would assume that Congress simply did not make these elements without any indication that these were nonelements and without any structural provision.","start":725.071,"stop":758.625,"duration":33.55},{"text":"In other words, it was not written in a way that these are not elements.","start":758.625,"stop":761.827,"duration":3.2},{"text":"In the carjacking case resolved by this Court in Jones, you'll see the same identical structure in this statute as exists with section 924(c), namely that whoever engages in certain action, in that case takes a car by use of a firearm, using intimidation or force or violence, shall be sentenced to a certain amount and, in the case of this statute, whoever uses or carries a firearm in a crime of violence prosecutable in a Federal court will receive a certain sentence.","start":761.827,"stop":798.666,"duration":36.84},{"text":"And in Jones, as in this case, it says, and if, the and-if clause
