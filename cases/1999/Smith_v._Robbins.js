I'd go this far for the sake of argument.","start":193.54,"stop":226.852,"duration":33.31},{"text":"Once you've shown that there's a possibility that there could be a difference, that there might be some merit, that's as much as you should require, or in effect you're going to turn Federal courts in habeas cases on Anders into State appellate courts.","start":226.852,"stop":243.554,"duration":16.7}]},{"speakerName":"Carol F.
