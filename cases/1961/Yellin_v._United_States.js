1958.","start":41.615,"stop":64.574,"duration":22.96},{"text":"The alleged subject under inquiry was Communist infiltration at the basic industry and it was the 10th investigation that the Committee

answer the questions put.","start":77.246,"stop":87.942,"duration":10.7},{"text":"He relied on what he conceived to be his rights under the Watkins decision.","start":87.942,"stop":94.088,"duration":6.15},{"text":"He also cited the vagueness of the authorizing resolution, his rights as he conceived them to be under the First Amendment, the lack of jurisdiction of the Committee over the subject of the inquiry.","start":94.088,"stop":108.227,"duration":14.14},{"text":"He did not rely on the Fifth Amendment.","start":108.227,"stop":112.995,"duration":4.77},{"text":"He was not tried until after the Barenblatt decision and he was found guilty on all four counts and received the maximum sentence

course.","start":152.955,"stop":168.351,"duration":15.4},{"text":"But I should like to state in all conduct that the constitutional issues in this case, which I propose to raise again, are

are we balancing here?","start":951.102,"stop":954.071,"duration":2.97},{"text":"The Court first speaks in terms of the competing private and public interests at stake in the particular circumstances shown.","start":954.071,"stop":964.797,"duration":10.73},{"text":"To me, that sounds like this is the question of fact to be determined in each case in accordance with the particular circumstances in each case.","start":964.797,"stop":974.775,"duration":9.98},{"text":"Now, it's hard and I was puzzled about how to address myself to this problem but it wasn't my language and it wasn't my ruling, it was this Court's ruling.","start":974.775,"stop":986.829,"duration":12.05},{"text":"And so at the trial, I attempted to address myself to this question, what are we

says resolution of the issue always involves a balancing by the Courts.","start":1004.348,"stop":1012.2,"duration":7.85},{"text":"And so the Courts, presumably, in the first instance, the trial court has to balance these issues.","start":1012.2,"stop":1023.748,"duration":11.55},{"text":"Now, part of the question is easy.","start":1023.748,"stop":1026.141,"duration":2.39},{"text":"On the one side

scale?","start":1033.085,"stop":1038.163,"duration":5.08},{"text":"Is it possible that each judge reads the morning newspapers, decides how much protection the national interest requires this day or
