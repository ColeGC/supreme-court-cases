Physiology.","start":516.268,"stop":546.881,"duration":30.61},{"text":"He has made arrangements to leave England to come to the United States beginning in, I think, June or July of

demanded.","start":554.504,"stop":561.363,"duration":6.86},{"text":"On the same day that he wrote to Dr. Landis, he wrote to the Massachusetts Advisory Committee, which is an institution established under the Selective Service Law to recommend whether doctor s should be deferred because they're essential to civilian life.","start":561.363,"stop":575.685,"duration":14.32},{"text":"And he wrote to them saying that he had accepted his position and was going to teach at Harvard and that he thought it would be essential to civilian life that he should be deferred from the draft, but he was not deferred from the draft.","start":575.685,"stop":586.199,"duration":10.51},{"text":"The Harvard authorities did not recommend that he be deferred, the Massachusetts Advisory Committee recommended that he not be deferred and he was not deferred from the draft.","start":586.199,"stop":596.105,"duration":9.91},{"text":"And the short of it is and this appears in the record from documents really, the short of it is, that when Dr. Cort, in England,discovered that he would not be deferred from the draft if he came back to the United States, he immediately cancelled his employment with Harvard and stated that he would remain abroad.","start":596.105,"stop":617.101,"duration":21},{"text":"This was in the spring of 1953, he did not return to the United

since.","start":632.129,"stop":639.313,"duration":7.18},{"text":"He was indicted, I should say just to complete the story that he was order -- he was ordered at various times to report for a physical examination by the draft authorities in Massachusetts.","start":639.313,"stop":654.161,"duration":14.85},{"text":"He refused to do so even though he was allowed to proceed to have himself physically

pending.","start":677.006,"stop":682.99,"duration":5.98},{"text":"Now, I should say at once that we make no plan and we have never made a plan that Dr. Cort is going to Europe, I mean in May and June of 1951 was for the purpose of evading the draft, it was not.","start":682.99,"stop":695.852,"duration":12.86},{"text":"He went to take a position at Cambridge University.","start":695.852,"stop":698.671,"duration":2.82},{"text":"We do make the claim that he remained abroad directly and specifically because he did not wish to serve in the armed forces.","start":698.671,"stop":707.107,"duration":8.44},{"text":"Now, as I've mentioned, he remained in England until August 1954 and then he went to Czechoslovakia.","start":707.107,"stop":713.276,"duration":6.17},{"text":"And the record contained some indication that when he went to Czechoslovakia in August 1954, he apparently told the Czechoslovakian authorities that he was stateless at that time because the record indicates that he had a permit, a residence permit in Czechoslovakia which indicated him as stateless.","start":713.276,"stop":732.942,"duration":19.67},{"text":"Its equipped Page 87 in the record Mr. Justice and it's -- it appears from a statement on his later application for a passport.","start":732.942,"stop":748.377,"duration":15.43},{"text":"It's rather hard to read on the Photostat but in the middle of the page, you will see there in typewritten form that he has a residence permit apprentice' stateless number so and so issued October 22, 1954 by a Czechoslovakian authority which was valid until October 22, 1959.","start":748.377,"stop":771.27,"duration":22.89},{"text":"Now, Dr. Cort had a passport when he went to England which he -- which expired in 1952 – 52.","start":771.27,"stop":782.612,"duration":11.34},{"text":"He did not seek to renew that passport until 1959.","start":782.612,"stop":787.969,"duration":5.36},{"text":"In April 1959, he applied for a renewal of his passport and this was almost five years after he went to Czechoslovakia.","start":787.969,"stop":799.696,"duration":11.73},{"text":"It was denied by the State Department on the ground

1952 Act.","start":811.403,"stop":830.498,"duration":19.1},{"text":"And that they had -- and the State Department had instructed the embassy at Prague to give due consideration to his application for
