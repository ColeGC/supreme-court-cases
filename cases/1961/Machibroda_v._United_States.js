these were obtained based upon guilty pleas and by his motion under Section 2255, petitioner contends that his pleas were wrongfully induced by promises made by the prosecutor, the Assistant United

this proceeding unless, in the words of a statute which is on the top of page 4 of petitioner's brief, unless the motion and the files and records of the case, conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the Court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States Attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact in conclusions of law with respect thereto.","start":291.989,"stop":334.61,"duration":42.62},{"text":"The court below has determined in the language of the statute that the files and records of this case

the record beginning on page 13, and there is of course the most crucial document in the case.","start":350.464,"stop":358.358,"duration":7.89},{"text":"The most pertinent allegations concerning the bargain are on pages 14 and 15.","start":358.358,"stop":366.359,"duration":8},{"text":"In sum, without reading this now, the petitioner alleges that there were three relevant conversations between the Assistant United States Attorney and himself.","start":366.359,"stop":377.504,"duration":11.15},{"text":"The first occurred in the county jail where he was being detained on or about February 21st, 1956 which was three days before his arraignment.","start":377.504,"stop":388.516,"duration":11.01},{"text":"The prosecutor promised petitioner that if he entered pleas of guilty, he would receive a total sentence of 20 years.","start":388.516,"stop":396.51,"duration":7.99},{"text":"The promise was set to be made with the authority of the United States Attorney and was implied to be agreeable to the judge.","start":396.51,"stop":402.052,"duration":5.54},{"text":"It was a bargain that was virtually ironclad.","start":402.052,"stop":407.389,"duration":5.34},{"text":"Further, petitioner was expressly cautioned not to tell his lawyer of the bargain.","start":407.389,"stop":413.119,"duration":5.73},{"text":"The lawyer was taken out of the arrangements.","start":413.119,"stop":416.938,"duration":3.82},{"text":"The second conversations took place in the county jail on May 22nd, 1956 which was the day before sentencing.","start":416.938,"stop":424.009,"duration":7.07},{"text":"At that time, the prosecutor reported the petitioner that the judge was “vexed”, because petitioner had testified in behalf of a codefendant who had stood trial in these proceedings.","start":424.009,"stop":436.995,"duration":12.99},{"text":"The prosecutor indicated there might be some trouble with respect to the agreement that the sentence was not to exceed a total of 20 years.","start":436.995,"stop":444.527,"duration":7.53},{"text":"When petitioner protested that he was going to bring the whole thing to the attention of the judge in open court, the prosecutor replied there's nothing to worry about.","start":444.527,"stop":452.76,"duration":8.23},{"text":"If the court imposes more than a 20 year sentence, the United States Attorney would move to have a sentence reduced within 60 days, an authorized procedure and the petitioner was further told threateningly that if he “insisted on making a scene” his difficulty would be compounded with further charges.","start":452.76,"stop":472.303,"duration":19.54},{"text":"Third conversation took place immediately after sentence had been announced on May 23rd.","start":472.303,"stop":478.369,"duration":6.07},{"text":"Again, the prosecutor promised that as soon as the judge “cooled off”, the United States Attorney would have a sentence reduced to 20 years and the prisoner was taken off to begin to serve his sentence.","start":478.369,"stop":492.991,"duration":14.62},{"text":"The motion further alleges that subsequent to his incarceration, he sent two letters to the Judge and two letters to the Attorney General protesting against the failure of the Government and the Court to keep the bargain.","start":492.991,"stop":509.146,"duration":16.16},{"text":"He received no reply to either of these letters.","start":509.146,"stop":512.818,"duration":3.67},{"text":"Now this is in general the substance of the allegations of the motion.","start":512.818,"stop":518.091,"duration":5.27},{"text":"What has happened in effect is that the Government and the court below has tried this motion virtually received evidence, in fact, received evidence without having allowed the prisoner even the basic rights of a hearing.","start":518.091,"stop":536.748,"duration":18.66},{"text":"The Government concedes, I believe it's a concession.","start":536.748,"stop":539.239,"duration":2.49},{"text":"It's hard to read but there is nothing in the files and records of this case which is inconsistent with the motion on behalf of the petitioner.","start":539.239,"stop":553.574,"duration":14.33},{"text":"And this is -- it is in itself deemed I suppose his basic rights.","start":553.574,"stop":559.08,"duration":5.51},{"text":"He is pictured as a prisoner who had deliberately concocted a story, tailor-made so-called to fit the facts of this case and explain any apparent inconsistencies by some facts not in the record.","start":559.08,"stop":575.228,"duration":16.15},{"text":"This voice of the prisoner makes him I suppose, a psychopathic liar who cannot be believed, no matter what he says even though I take that the Government concedes there's not a single fact in the record which tends to contradict the story of the bargain as he alleges.","start":575.228,"stop":596.189,"duration":20.96},{"text":"What does appear in the first instance is the affidavit as I mentioned of the Assistant United States Attorney.","start":596.189,"stop":603.845,"duration":7.66},{"text":"This was filed as an appendix or in appended to, the response of United States and is relied upon heavily by the Government in their brief and -- in their brief and this Court.","start":603.845,"stop":614.767,"duration":10.92},{"text":"I cannot find one single justifiable reason for that affidavit to be in this case.","start":614.767,"stop":621.595,"duration":6.83},{"text":"It is nothing more or less an attempt to try the case without having a hearing.","start":621.595,"stop":627.931,"duration":6.34},{"text":"If as the Government must do, they conceived the facts as alleged by the motion for purposes of summary disposition, the affidavit is at no point, the Government says the affidavit is here simply to show that the Government does not agree with the fact alleged in the motion which would be perfectly obvious without the affidavit.","start":627.931,"stop":646.912,"duration":18.98}]},{"speakerName":"John M.

Reitz","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, the Government says and they're technically quite accurate that the court below did not specifically rely on it.","start":674.582,"stop":682.963,"duration":8.38},{"text":"However, in this opinion of the Court which appears on the record on the beginning on page 47th, the Court does have a sentence which is unusual for a simple passing reference on page 49, the three quarters of the way down under oath, Clarence M. Condon, former Assistant United States Attorney empathically denied these allegations.","start":682.963,"stop":706.23,"duration":23.27},{"text":"That's a stronger statement that I would expect from a simple recitation of fact but there is nothing in here to indicate that the Court expressly relied upon that affidavit, that's true.","start":706.23,"stop":717.161,"duration":10.93},{"text":"Now the second piece of evidence that is in here, it's nothing more or less than testimony of the District Court.","start":717.161,"stop":724.973,"duration":7.81},{"text":"The Judge says on the bottom of page 49, in reference to the letters which the prisoner said he sent from prison protesting the breach of faith on the part of the prosecutor in court, the Judge says this Court did not receive two letters from the defendant.","start":724.973,"stop":743.662,"duration":18.69},{"text":"That is nothing more or less in the statement by a witness.","start":743.662,"stop":748.206,"duration":4.54},{"text":"As Justice Frankfurter said in the Gibson case, human memory is a very treacherous thing and that's particularly true when you don't recall something having happened.","start":748.206,"stop":759.167,"duration":10.96},{"text":"The judge has dismissed these allegations as to protests filed contemporaneous with the man's entering into prison by saying, “I don't remember receiving them.”","start":759.167,"stop":770.249,"duration":11.08},{"text":"Now, even if it's true that the judge did not receive the letters even that would not prove that the letters had not been sent.","start":770.249,"stop":778.065,"duration":7.82},{"text":"The prisoner alleges that they were posted.","start":778.065,"stop":781.02,"duration":2.95},{"text":"He cannot of course allege that they were received.","start":781.02,"stop":784.662,"duration":3.64},{"text":"Whether they ever got to the courthouse, whether they were handled by members of the clerk staff and the court no one really knows at this point.","start":784.662,"stop":793.036,"duration":8.37},{"text":"There's been no hearing on the allegations.","start":793.036,"stop":796.697,"duration":3.66},{"text":"Now the second bit of evidence which the court does formerly use is a letter allegedly received by the court some six months after the prisoner got to prison.","start":796.697,"stop":809.533,"duration":12.84},{"text":"In this letter, the prisoner in a very neat tone asked for clemency.","start":809.533,"stop":816.733,"duration":7.2},{"text":"Now the Court on page 40 -- on page 50, describes this as evidence which indeed it is.","start":816.733,"stop":824.499,"duration":7.77},{"text":"There has been no showing that this letter is authentic.","start":824.499,"stop":827.977,"duration":3.48},{"text":"There has been no introduction of this letter into the files and workers of this case.","start":827.977,"stop":832.402,"duration":4.43},{"text":"It's simply a letter, a private letter sent by a prisoner to a judge.","start":832.402,"stop":838.031,"duration":5.63},{"text":"The letter was bad enough but the inference from which the judge draws from this letter is even worse.","start":838.031,"stop":843.389,"duration":5.36},{"text":"The judge says that the inference from this letter shows the defendant's allegations must be false because he's asking for clemency rather than protesting the breach of faith.","start":843.389,"stop":855.191,"duration":11.8},{"text":"This inference I submit the defendant is entitled under all element reconceptions of due process to rebut.","start":855.191,"stop":864.788,"duration":9.6},{"text":"The prisoner recall has allege that he

say that a prisoner who has twice tried to assert his rights and found assertion futile might try an alternative route.","start":874.78,"stop":885.949,"duration":11.17},{"text":"So that even if this letter is authentic, the prisoner is entitled to argue to the court that the inference which the judge has drawn and from which he says so conclusively disproves the facts, is in fact not founded in fact.","start":885.949,"stop":904.251,"duration":18.3},{"text":"But the prisoner seeking clemency was doing nothing more or less than seeking an alternative route.","start":904.251,"stop":916.956,"duration":12.71},{"text":"The Government as I say in their brief page 41 has put great stress on the lack of collaboration by the facts alleged by the defendant.","start":916.956,"stop":926.806,"duration":9.85},{"text":"Even on this meager record however there is fairly ample corroboration of what happened.","start":926.806,"stop":933.192,"duration":6.39},{"text":"In the first place, the United States Attorney's affidavit and here, I suppose serves some cross purpose.","start":933.192,"stop":939.127,"duration":5.93},{"text":"The United States Attorney's affidavit admits interviewing the prisoner in the county jail, denies that it was done for this purpose
