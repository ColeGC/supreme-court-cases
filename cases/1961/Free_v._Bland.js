there was no fraud or constructive fraud or improper or overreaching activity on the part of the husband that it's been alleged of proof and there was therefore no basis for upsetting the survivorship rule.","start":318.28,"stop":335.328,"duration":17.05},{"text":"Respondent then sought writ of error to the Supreme Court of Texas.","start":335.328,"stop":340.412,"duration":5.08},{"text":"While the

below.","start":621.6,"stop":630.583,"duration":8.98},{"text":"The first and the broadest and I think the only one that the -- the court below really considered is that the Treasury Regulations with respect to survivorship of co-owner bonds are not intended to control beneficial ownership at all but are merely intended to provide a convenience by which the Government may pay the bonds offered, they're becoming embroiled in a local private controversies over ownership.","start":630.583,"stop":658.112,"duration":27.53},{"text":"A narrow argument here is that really these bonds could be looked upon as having been bought with someone else's property, that obviously the Treasury Regulations cannot be used as a cover up for fraud or for conversion.","start":658.112,"stop":675.228,"duration":17.12},{"text":"And that therefore even if the regulations mean to control beneficial ownership, you can go behind them in order to trace someone else's property.","start":675.228,"stop":685.703,"duration":10.48},{"text":"Now, I'd like to deal very briefly with the broader question first.","start":685.703,"stop":690.819,"duration":5.12},{"text":"I think that this one is really rather easy if we look at the text of the regulations and at how they have been applied over some 25 years.","start":690.819,"stop":702.724,"duration":11.91},{"text":"The regulations are set out in the appendix to the petitioner's brief at pages 35 and following, and there're only two that are really I think quite pertinent to this problem.","start":702.724,"stop":716.785,"duration":14.06},{"text":"On page 37 about brief, Section 315.61 of Title 31 Code of Federal Regulations, which is the Treasury circular -- the provisions of which are incorporated by reference on the phase of the bonds is their issue.","start":716.785,"stop":736.729,"duration":19.94},{"text":"Provide that, “If either co-owner dies, without the bond having been presented and surrendered for payment or authorized reissue, the survivor will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner.\"","start":736.729,"stop":752.606,"duration":15.88},{"text":"Now, to make sure that they really meant that this was to control beneficial ownership and not -- not merely method of payment, it was provided in Section 315.20 which is on page 36 of our brief.","start":752.606,"stop":768.715,"duration":16.11},{"text":"That in certain cases, state decisions, judicial determinations with respect to conflicting claims of ownership, would be recognized but that was subject to this very specific limitation.","start":768.715,"stop":784.755,"duration":16.04},{"text":"“No judicial determination will be recognized which would give effect to an attempted voluntary transfer inter vivos of a bond or would defeat or impair the rights of survivorship conferred by these regulations upon a surviving co-owner or beneficiary and all other provisions of this sub-court are subject to this restriction.”","start":784.755,"stop":810.586,"duration":25.83},{"text":"Now, the Government here has filed a brief amicus curiae in which they have set out at considerable length.","start":810.586,"stop":819.96,"duration":9.37},{"text":"The Government's -- the Treasury's consistent interpretation of these regulations and have explained I think, quite convincingly, the reason why the regulations with respect to survivorship and beneficiary provisions which are the only ones in which these regulations says that no judicial this determination will be permitted to change.","start":819.96,"stop":844.342,"duration":24.38},{"text":"Why those particular ones are in important to the Government and why the Government intended to make the bonds subject to those regulations regardless of what state law provide.","start":844.342,"stop":857.863,"duration":13.52},{"text":"The reason is that savings bonds issued under the Second Limited Loan Act of 1917 as amended in 1935 were basically designed to provide a safe, simple, and attractive method of investment for small investors and particularly for family savings.","start":857.863,"stop":881.615,"duration":23.75},{"text":"Now, one of the attractive features of a savings bond was that the man of the family or the wife of the family could take his -- his or her money invested in a bond which was payable on debt to his wife or his child or as was done here, invested in a bond in the name of himself and his wife.","start":881.615,"stop":904.576,"duration":22.96},{"text":"And he could be assured and was assured by the circulars which the Treasury put out in effect to prospectuses, was assured that if he die, the survivor would be entitled to the bond and there would be no difficulty with the states, the administrations, complicated provisions of state law, validity of whether there had been a gift inter vivos under the varying state laws, and that the rule would be the same whether he lived in Texas or Maine or California.","start":904.576,"stop":935.672,"duration":31.1},{"text":"So that the Treasury has consistently push this very hard, the United States has appeared as amicus curiae in literally dozens of state cases all around the country, through the District Attorneys and have asserted this position.","start":935.672,"stop":953.646,"duration":17.97},{"text":"The state courts in turn have upheld this interpretation, the overriding interpretation of the federal regulation in the great majority of cases.","start":953.646,"stop":965.107,"duration":11.46},{"text":"They are set out in our brief for -- passed frankly note from anyway, set out in our brief at pages 23 and 24.","start":965.107,"stop":975.236,"duration":10.13},{"text":"Three or four states of which Texas is one have adopted a mino -- a minority view giving usually the reason that they don't interpret the Treasury Regulations to this way.","start":975.236,"stop":983.621,"duration":8.38},{"text":"They interpret them is merely controlling method of plaintiff.","start":983.621,"stop":990.266,"duration":6.64},{"text":"We think that the majority rule of the Treasury's interpretation is plainly right and thus the judgment of the Supreme Court of
