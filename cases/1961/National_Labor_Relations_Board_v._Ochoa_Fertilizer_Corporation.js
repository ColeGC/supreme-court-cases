Appeals for the First Circuit to review a decision modifying upon the Court's own motion, a cease-and-desist order entered by the National Labor Relations Board upon the stipulation and consent of the respondents.","start":41.067,"stop":62.18,"duration":21.11},{"text":"The respondents having signed that stipulation and consent have taken no further part in these proceedings.","start":62.18,"stop":70.767,"duration":8.59},{"text":"The question presented as we see it is whether the Court of Appeals may properly modify as too broad a cease-and-desist order entered by the National Labor Relations Board where the respondents not only raised no objection to the scope of the order, but actually consented to its issuance and enforcement in the exact form in which enforcement was sought.","start":70.767,"stop":96.18,"duration":25.41},{"text":"I should say that this case is one of a group.","start":96.18,"stop":100.034,"duration":3.85},{"text":"There are two other cases in which petitions have been filed to review companion decisions by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit; the Las Vegas Sand and Gravel case which is Number 38 and Local 476 of the Plumbers which is Number 39.","start":100.034,"stop":118.172,"duration":18.14},{"text":"In addition, there's a petition pending in the Brandman Iron case to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh

case.","start":145.397,"stop":149.035,"duration":3.64},{"text":"The Plumbers case was not, and I believe the Las Vegas case was not a consent decree case.","start":149.035,"stop":158.188,"duration":9.15},{"text":"The facts in this case are as follows, charges were filed against the employer, Ochoa and two labor organizations in 1958 under the National Labor Relations Act.","start":158.188,"stop":177.81,"duration":19.62},{"text":"A complaint was issued on February 26, 1959.","start":177.81,"stop":184.177,"duration":6.37},{"text":"The complaint appears at page 13 of the record.","start":184.177,"stop":189.447,"duration":5.27},{"text":"The complaint set out first that Ochoa was an employer subject to the act of Puerto Rico because he engaged in interstate commerce and it also identified as the respondents a local labor organization, a local of the Longshoremen's and a counsel of local league of labor organization, also representing employees seeking to organize employees in Puerto Rico.","start":189.447,"stop":216.188,"duration":26.74},{"text":"The allegations were that Ochoa and the unions had entered an illegal contract -- entered into an illegal contract in 1951 which established a closed shop and illegal hiring hall and an illegal checkoff, all in violation of Section 8 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act so far as the employer was concerned and 8 (b) so far as the union was concerned.","start":216.188,"stop":241.824,"duration":25.64},{"text":"The complaint set forth that the agreement had been renewed in 1955 and that at all times between 1951 at the issuance of the complaint, the employer and the labor union had maintained the agreement and given effect to it.","start":241.824,"stop":259.809,"duration":17.99},{"text":"You'll recall it under the National Labor Relations Act, any form of union security that is any form of closed shop, union shop or checkoff is illegal unless the union has been designated by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit, so that the contract and its maintenance were illegal according to the complaint under that provision.","start":259.809,"stop":284.197,"duration":24.39},{"text":"Second, it's settled law that a closed shop, one which requires an employee to be a member of the union before he is hired and a hiring hall, one which enables the union to hire the man for the employer are both illegal regardless of whether the union has the majority so that according to the complaint, there was a case under that branch of the law also.","start":284.197,"stop":309.629,"duration":25.43},{"text":"A period of time then went by and in January 1960, the respondents, the employer and the two labor organizations, the local and the counsel entered into a stipulation.","start":309.629,"stop":323.527,"duration":13.9},{"text":"The stipulation appears at 21 of the record and following.","start":323.527,"stop":329.153,"duration":5.63},{"text":"It recites the charge and the complaint and then sets forth the facts necessary to give the Board jurisdiction relating to interstate commerce, contrary to the statement in the Court of Appeals, there was no admission or denial of the Board's allegations.","start":329.153,"stop":347.702,"duration":18.55},{"text":"That indeed is not practice in entering into consent orders in National Labor Relations Board cases.","start":347.702,"stop":354.942,"duration":7.24},{"text":"The stipulation then went on and set forth in precise terms, the order which was to be entered by the Board and you will find the order as recited in the stipulation and as ultimately entered by the Board beginning at page 24 of the record.","start":354.942,"stop":373.655,"duration":18.71},{"text":"Insofar as the employer is concerned, Ochoa, it was ordered, I am just below the middle of page 24, to cease-and-desist from performing, maintaining or otherwise giving effect to any agreement, arrangement, practice or understanding with ILA Council or ILA Local 1762, those were the two respondent unions or any other labor organizations, those are the controversial words as this case arises, to cease from giving effect to any understanding with these two locals or with any other labor organization which in an unlawful manner conditions employment or the retention of the employment upon clearance or approval by the aforementioned labor organization.","start":373.655,"stop":423.061,"duration":49.41},{"text":"In other words, this forbad the employer to maintain a hiring hall arrangement with these unions or any other unions.","start":423.061,"stop":432.368,"duration":9.31},{"text":"The next paragraph (b) forbids the employer to enter in to or give effect to any illegal union security contract, again, with these unions or any other labor organization and again, the words any other labor organizations are in question.","start":432.368,"stop":452.318,"duration":19.95},{"text":"There's no controversy concerning paragraph (c), then (d) forbids the employer to encourage membership in a labor organization either these or any other by discriminating in regard to hire or tenure employment.","start":452.318,"stop":468.696,"duration":16.38},{"text":"And again, there is a controversy over the words or any other labor organization.","start":468.696,"stop":475.748,"duration":7.05},{"text":"It's perhaps worth pointing out also the provisions or the controversies that over on page 26, the order went on to require the employer not only to withdraw recognition from these unions but specifically to join with the unions in reimbursing the employees for their checked off dues.","start":475.748,"stop":497.113,"duration":21.37},{"text":"I say that because this suggests that the Board -- local board authorities regarded this, a fairly important case, when the employer entered into this order which involved monetary liability that he can hardly have consented to it later.","start":497.113,"stop":512.642,"duration":15.53},{"text":"The provisions directed to the labor organizations, began on page 27.","start":512.642,"stop":518.871,"duration":6.23},{"text":"I won't trouble the Court to read them.","start":518.871,"stop":520.789,"duration":1.92},{"text":"They are the parallel or converse of the provisions relating to the employer and they ordered the union not to enter into such contract, not to establish hiring halls and not to induce employers to encourage or discourage membership in the labor organization and restrain the union from doing that not only in relation to Ochoa, the particular employer with respect to whom the unfair labor practice was committed but any other employer and again, it's the words any other employer that are in controversy.","start":520.789,"stop":558.637,"duration":37.85},{"text":"The Board in due course, entered an order in the precise terms of the stipulation and then following the stipulation, it filed the petition for enforcement of the order in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.","start":558.637,"stop":575.389,"duration":16.75},{"text":"The Board -- the Court of Appeals then entered its decree, modifying the Board's order by striking out the phrase “any other employer” or “any other labor organization” wherever it occurred.","start":575.389,"stop":593.34,"duration":17.95},{"text":"The Board filed this.","start":593.34,"stop":594.424,"duration":1.08},{"text":"It's been handled simply on the papers as a routine manner.","start":594.424,"stop":598.571,"duration":4.15},{"text":"The Board then filed a petition for reconsideration which was denied and it filed a second petition for reconsideration, calling attention to the fact that the First Circuit decision was in conflict with a case recently -- to then recently decided in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which had -- where the Second Circuit had refused to modify a similar consent order in a case which it was asked to and did enforce.","start":598.571,"stop":630.371,"duration":31.8},{"text":"On the Board's second petition for reconsideration, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit handed down an opinion covering not only this case but seven others.","start":630.371,"stop":643.057,"duration":12.69},{"text":"And since there's no appearance here for the respondents and of course none for the Court, it seems to me proper to go through that opinion in some detail because it represents the only statement of the -- in justification of what was done below.","start":643.057,"stop":661.094,"duration":18.04},{"text":"The opinion begins on page 60 of the record and follows on from there.","start":661.094,"stop":671.535,"duration":10.44},{"text":"The opinion begins by setting forth the facts of seven cases which were then before the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.","start":671.535,"stop":680.825,"duration":9.29},{"text":"In all of them, the respondent had committed unfair labor practices in relation either to one employer or one labor organization, but the decree enjoined repetition of the same identical unfair labor practices in relation to that employer or labor organization, the one involved, or in relation to any other employer or unfair labor practice.","start":680.825,"stop":706.029,"duration":25.2},{"text":"The cases were quite different, but they fall into three groups, and I think it's convenient to think of them that way.","start":706.029,"stop":715.228,"duration":9.2},{"text":"In one group, the consisting of four cases, the employers had engaged in conduct designed to discourage unionization or labor organization among their employees, the conduct varied little but it was the type of conduct which would take place when a union first -- might take place -- when a union first came and tried to organize a new plan.","start":715.228,"stop":742.376,"duration":27.15},{"text":"And the Board had simply entered orders in a well-established form approved by this Court in the past, ordering the employer not to interfere with union organization or to discourage joining this union or any other union.","start":742.376,"stop":760.576,"duration":18.2},{"text":"The second group consists of one case, Local 476 or the Plumbers Union.","start":760.576,"stop":768.551,"duration":7.98},{"text":"It involved a secondary boycott that is to say the Plumbers Union had induced the employees of one employer to stop doing their normal work in order to compel that employer to cease dealing with the employer with whom the Plumbers had their real dispute.","start":768.551,"stop":790.038,"duration":21.49},{"text":"The order in this case directed the respondent union not to engage in inducing the employees of this particular secondary employer to go on strike, but not to induce the employees of any other secondary employer to go on strike for the purpose of getting at primary employer.","start":790.038,"stop":813.555,"duration":23.52},{"text":"Now, I say the primary employer in its original form, the order covered any other primary employer.","start":813.555,"stop":821.154,"duration":7.6},{"text":"The Board on its petition for reconsideration did not ask the court to restore that so that what the order finally came down to in the controverted form was an order telling the union, “Don't exert pressure on any secondary employer in order to get this fellow with whom you have to fight.”","start":821.154,"stop":841.729,"duration":20.58},{"text":"The third of group of cases were made up of this Ochoa case which is before the Court and one other case for Puerto Rico involving the same counsel of Longshoremen's labor organizations, but apparently a different local and the facts of that case were substantially the same as this.","start":841.729,"stop":862.789,"duration":21.06},{"text":"So what we -- the Court had was different kinds of unfair labor practice, one, interference with organizational activity, the second, secondary boycotts, and the third, maintenance of an unlawful closed shop contract and unlawful discriminatory hiring provisions.","start":862.789,"stop":882.118,"duration":19.33},{"text":"After going through the facts of these seven cases, the Court concluded from them that the Board had a marked propensity for entering blanket orders and that apparently the Court said, “It did this automatically in every case without regard to the specific facts of the case.”","start":882.118,"stop":909.16,"duration":27.04},{"text":"The Court then turned to the law looking at the decision of this Court in the Express Publishing case and in the Communications Workers case that was decided a term or two ago.","start":909.16,"stop":922.24,"duration":13.08},{"text":"Judge Aldrich said, “That the rule was that if a broad injunction,” he spoke generally, those are his phrased words, “If a broad injunction was going to be entered, there must appear to be some affirmative reasons for it.”","start":922.24,"stop":938.548,"duration":16.31},{"text":"Then he took up the suggestions that the Board counsel had made in the request for reconsideration and said that there was no merit to the Board's argument that from the facts which appeared in the record, it was not unreasonable for the Board to conclude that the respondent might engage in the same misconduct, vis-à-vis another labor union or another employer.","start":938.548,"stop":968.676,"duration":30.13},{"text":"For example, the Board had suggested in the cases involving employer discouragement of union organization that it was reasonable to assume that if an organized employer interfered with restrained or coerced their employees in getting ready to join union (a) which was trying to organize the plant, that it was fair to infer that he would probably engage in the same misconduct if they began to join some other labor organization.","start":968.676,"stop":999.055,"duration":30.38},{"text":"But that, Judge Aldrich said was simply unsubstantiated supposition and was the kind of unsubstantiated supposition that had been held improper in the -- by this Court in the Communications Workers case.","start":999.055,"stop":1014.816,"duration":15.76},{"text":"Then at the top of page 66, he laid down what I think it's fair to say is a general rule.","start":1014.816,"stop":1021.588,"duration":6.77},{"text":"In those cases in which the record makes it apparent that there was for the single party involved, we will not grant it, in other words, will not grant an order broader that one limited to the single party involved.","start":1021.588,"stop":1036.788,"duration":15.2},{"text":"He then turned to the consent cases which presented of course a somewhat different problem than those -- in which the order has been entered after contest and he concluded that the Cheney California Lumber case in 327 U.S. authorized the Court to assume responsibility for the order even though the objection hadn't been raised below and to set it aside if it was too broad.","start":1036.788,"stop":1066.247,"duration":29.46},{"text":"As he read the case, the Court which we quite disagree with, the Cheney case was a holding that the record must substantiate the order and that it was immaterial and then if that wasn't done, it was immaterial whether the point had been raised below.","start":1066.247,"stop":1083.427,"duration":17.18},{"text":"He then went on and dealt with the Board's argument that in the consent cases, it must be assumed that there were facts that would warrant a broad order, and Judge Aldrich said as to that, that the Board had entered too many broad orders that it cried wolf too often and that therefore, the Court's, “Our normal disposition is to assume in the absence of a contrary showing that the case is an ordinary one rather than a special case calling for extraordinary relief.”","start":1083.427,"stop":1119.558,"duration":36.13},{"text":"And then he went on and argued that if the Board was to get a broad order by consent, there must appear in the stipulation some facts showing that there had been a generalized scheme to violate the act.","start":1119.558,"stop":1136.265,"duration":16.71},{"text":"And the final part of the opinion develops his reasons for thinking that this would not interfere with the Board's handling of cases by consent without a content.","start":1136.265,"stop":1150.305,"duration":14.04},{"text":"We then brought the case here, the decision of the First Circuit conflicts with decisions in the Second, Sixth and District of Columbia Circuits.","start":1150.305,"stop":1164.463,"duration":14.16},{"text":"It is supported by the decision of the Seventh Circuit in the Brandman Iron case.","start":1164.463,"stop":1170.041,"duration":5.58}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Solicitor, you may have told us but I missed it if you did.","start":1170.041,"stop":1173.133,"duration":3.09},{"text":"How many of the seven cases that Judge Aldrich took under review are now before this Court?","start":1173.133,"stop":1182.712,"duration":9.58}]},{"speakerName":"Archibald Cox","textObjs":[{"text":"Three, one of each

which it might be important to point out.","start":1221.275,"stop":1227.828,"duration":6.55},{"text":"It again said it relied on the concurring opinion of Justice Stone in the Cheney case for saying that the court has a special responsibility with respect to the scope of the decree.","start":1227.828,"stop":1240.67,"duration":12.84},{"text":"Then it says that if it entered a broader decree, there would -- might be a problem on contempt if the -- it was an effort later to punish the union for conduct not in relation to the parties to the litigation before the Board.","start":1240.67,"stop":1259.674,"duration":19},{"text":"It seems to that, I may say, that one of the fundamental errors that the Seventh Circuit, the First Circuit appeared to have committed is in thinking of these cases before the Board as if they were contest between the private parties, the charging party and the respondent whereas of course what the Board is concerned with is preventing the renewal of the unfair practices on a broader scale and in the public interest and not simply to protect private individuals involved.","start":1259.674,"stop":1292.497,"duration":32.82},{"text":"Our position in this case is very simple.","start":1292.497,"stop":1298.314,"duration":5.82},{"text":"We believe that the court below erred in undertaking to modify an order of the National Labor Relations Board which was unquestionably within its jurisdiction both as to the subject matter and the extent of the order and which

years with an accumulation of experience, and we now generalize it and say that is what this mass of cases over the decades has shown, that when there is opposition to unionization not based on any
