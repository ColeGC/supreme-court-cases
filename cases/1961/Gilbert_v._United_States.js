checks which were quickly put in evidence, quickly stipulated that the payees did not sign them, that the defendants signed them as it signed all the other checks.","start":453.885,"stop":470.319,"duration":16.43},{"text":"So that the checks, in our view, never gave nor in -- were intended to give the appearance of containing the actual signature of --

authority.","start":531.354,"stop":536.506,"duration":5.15},{"text":"He may either -- if he has authority, he may either -- either sign the payees name with nothing more.","start":536.506,"stop":544.988,"duration":8.48},{"text":"Now, if he has authority, that is not a forged endorsement and that authority can either be oral or written.","start":544.988,"stop":552.472,"duration":7.48},{"text":"If he has no authority, then that is clearly a forgery that we don't question about it.","start":552.472,"stop":558.908,"duration":6.44},{"text":"But where a man signs, endorses a check with the payees name, and some place on that check, it is indicated that he's not attempting to palm off the signature of the payee as the signature of the payee but indicates that he is signing the representative capacity classically in all the cases we've been able to find, it clearly indicates the forgery statute doesn't encompass that kind of a situation.","start":558.908,"stop":590.872,"duration":31.96},{"text":"The most that can be said -- the most that can be said is that, that person signing that check in that fashion, is indicating to the world that he signed the payees name, not that the payee signed it, but he signed it, but that, he then puts the person unnoticed as to his authority.","start":590.872,"stop":613.175,"duration":22.3},{"text":"And I think Justice Stewart raised the question as to what the bank's attitude would be in that kind of a situation.","start":613.175,"stop":620.118,"duration":6.94},{"text":"The bank's attitude in that type of a situation when it receives a check which it understands is side in a rep -- representative capacity, then it is -- they must then satisfy themselves as to the authority of the person signing that check because if they are wrong, if the authority doesn't exist, then they would be liable to the next endorsement on that check.","start":620.118,"stop":650.351,"duration":30.23},{"text":"They would've guaranteed all the previous endorsements.","start":650.351,"stop":653.5,"duration":3.15},{"text":"But I submit to the Court classically, and it is not the law that such an endorsement constitutes a forged instrument.","start":653.5,"stop":663.13,"duration":9.63},{"text":"If any legislature accuses to include within their definition of forgery, a forgery without authority, that, I submit to this Court,

found here.","start":5763.606,"stop":5785.48,"duration":21.87},{"text":"That petitioner was not privy to the Bartfields, or at least to make a man's own act hereto have been done at a time when it was
