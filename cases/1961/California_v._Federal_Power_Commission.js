direct purchase outside and bring it in to the detriment of the business of the Southern California gas companies.”","start":713.062,"stop":746.644,"duration":33.58},{"text":"And I asked him, “When

produce gas has risen and all of which of course ultimately will be paid -- paid for by the consumers as operating expenses and under the law properly so even though this might have been
