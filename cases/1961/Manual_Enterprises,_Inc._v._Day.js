that he, the postal inspector, would conduct his investigation would be to mail out what he called test letters.","start":1202.814,"stop":1210.159,"duration":7.35},{"text":"Well, we did the same thing, that is the publisher of this magazine did the same thing and he even went further, and he expended more money than the postal inspectors did because he actually found materials that were not
