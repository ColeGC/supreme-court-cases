100% of this industry, it meant that they could with impunity eliminate a competitor so long as they themselves still have enough to serve the general public.","start":375.522,"stop":391.376,"duration":15.85},{"text":"Now, on the context of this case, I think it will be an idle act to send this back to the Court of Appeals and go directly to the

would have to say that the Klor case was error and that the trial court's contempt of this Court in its statement that it didn't -- it proposed to start reversing the Supreme Court in refusing to give the Bigelow doc -- the Bigelow instruction that in view of that situation, we respectfully submit that it would be more practical under the circumstances to send it back to the District Court.","start":400.229,"stop":424.172,"duration":23.94},{"text":"Now, when the Court of Appeals decided if there wasn't enough evidence on causation to send this case to the jury, it still hadn't

respect to that, that since the business was eliminated and since this business was taken away from petitioners by a subsidiary of one of respondents which was acting at the time as a purchasing agent

facts.","start":439.92,"stop":468.244,"duration":28.32},{"text":"So, what the Court of Appeals did, we respectfully submit, was first of all, take away the case from the jury when there was manifestly

two inferences, that there was some resolutions of facts that had to be made by a trier of the facts because the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in affirming the judgements in the companion cases is inconsistent with the view that under no circumstances could you find antitrust liability here.","start":507.797,"stop":532.681,"duration":24.88},{"text":"There was in this

of the United States Vanadium Corporation that the corporations here intended to monopolize every face of the industry and they were instructed to fair about competition wherever it might arise or to determine what claims or determine what business might form the nucleus for a competitive operation and to remove it and pursuant to this, they did.","start":570.558,"stop":598.62,"duration":28.06},{"text":"It was a remarkably successful conspiracy to monopolize, resulting in 100% of the ferrovanadium industry, the respondents acquiring 90%

other's customers.","start":640.865,"stop":644.926,"duration":4.06},{"text":"They cooperate in connection with the exploitation of certain claims to the extent that one respondent mine the claims of

developed certain processes which produced a superior type vanadium.","start":679.861,"stop":685.57,"duration":5.71},{"text":"This all has to be admitted for the purposes of this -- for the purposes of the -- hearing this motion.","start":685.57,"stop":693.345,"duration":7.77},{"text":"His vanadium contained approximately 80% of the vanadium content of

product.","start":705.945,"stop":712.765,"duration":6.82},{"text":"So, he came in 1938 and made certain contracts for the production of ferrovanadium in this

vanadium industry.","start":721.301,"stop":745.593,"duration":24.29},{"text":"The evidence on this was direct.","start":745.593,"stop":748.427,"duration":2.83},{"text":"It is the Vice President of the United States Vanadium Company admitted it and he admitted to a conversation with the President of the Vanadium Corporation of America when a certain project was being discussed to take uranium from the ore without having the vanadium milled at the same time and the President of the Vanadium Corporation of America, one of the respondents, says that that would permit this petitioner to get into business, and this is exactly what we have been trying to prevent.","start":748.427,"stop":776.471,"duration":28.04},{"text":"The evidence discloses,

discloses for the chief source of supply for these petitioners.","start":823.28,"stop":829.545,"duration":6.26},{"text":"So, it was found by the jury in Salt Lake and affirmed by the court in Denver
