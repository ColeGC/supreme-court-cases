prosecution.","start":481.327,"stop":504.023,"duration":22.7},{"text":"He was not tried on the grand jury's charges.","start":504.023,"stop":506.773,"duration":2.75},{"text":"And I think it's also clear that counsel was not present, and it's not disputed, the counsel was not present at any stage of the trial proceedings.","start":506.773,"stop":514.501,"duration":7.73},{"text":"The record is silent completely with respect to whether or not petitioner requested the assistance of counsel.","start":514.501,"stop":521.813,"duration":7.31},{"text":"It's likewise silent as to any advice by the Court to petitioner of -- of a right to counsel either counsel of his own choosing or counsel appointed by the State.","start":521.813,"stop":531.72,"duration":9.91},{"text":"The verbatim trans -- transcript of the proceedings, as the Court will note from the record, takes -- starts at a point when the jury has already been selected in the court, it is instructing the petitioner that he has the right to make an opening statement to that jury and there's nothing in the record about the proceedings prior to that time either at the trial.","start":531.72,"stop":551.946,"duration":20.23},{"text":"There's nothing in the record with respect to an arraignment or anything of that sort when petitioner might have been advised of a right to counsel.","start":551.946,"stop":560.347,"duration":8.4},{"text":"So I think we -- we'll have to conclude that the record is silent on that point.","start":560.347,"stop":565.353,"duration":5.01},{"text":"The respondent in -- in his return to petitioner's writ does not allege any waiver by petitioner of the right to counsel.","start":565.353,"stop":573.45,"duration":8.1},{"text":"That point was never presented as a factual matter to the support of the Supreme Court though the Florida Supreme Court did refer to the presumption of waiver in its opinion.","start":573.45,"stop":584.589,"duration":11.14},{"text":"And the respondent here in its brief does suggest that in fact, this presumption of waiver should control.","start":584.589,"stop":593.515,"duration":8.93},{"text":"Finally, I think there isn't any question that petitioner is in fact and has established his illiteracy.","start":593.515,"stop":599.08,"duration":5.57},{"text":"The Florida Supreme Court said on its examination of the record that there is no question that petitioner is illiterate.","start":599.08,"stop":607.319,"duration":8.24},{"text":"Without going into detail review of the numerous opinions of this Court, culminating, I -- I noticed yesterday in your Chewning

fundamental fairness required by Betts versus Brady.","start":607.319,"stop":632.922,"duration":25.6},{"text":"I would like to -- to call to the Court's attention the -- the more or less clear, I think, proposition that among the circumstances that must be considered following the Betts versus Brady rule in determining whether or not fundamental fairness existed at any trial in state court

trial.","start":632.922,"stop":663.723,"duration":30.8},{"text":"I think also, it's -- it's completely clear, at this point as emphasized in the Chewning opinion yesterday, that the complexity of the

involved.","start":701.6,"stop":728.473,"duration":26.87},{"text":"Petitioner's basic argument is that his -- the circumstances of his conviction clearly were sufficient to bring back conviction
