this case.","start":304.664,"stop":316.531,"duration":11.87},{"text":"It was the largest retail chain of family shoe stores.","start":316.531,"stop":320.632,"duration":4.1},{"text":"It had 352 stores

manufacturer.","start":362.54,"stop":367.234,"duration":4.69},{"text":"It sold, lumping them all together, 1.3% of the national total.","start":367.234,"stop":375.198,"duration":7.96},{"text":"Broken down into the three categories, Kinney sold 1.7% of children's shoes, 1.4% of women's shoes, there was a much smaller factor in the men's shoe market, only 3%.","start":375.198,"stop":389.329,"duration":14.13},{"text":"So that to pull this together, the merger combined the fourth and 13th largest manufacturers.","start":389.329,"stop":397.197,"duration":7.87},{"text":"The fourth largest manufacturer in the market with the most aggressive and largest of the independent retailers having 1.7% of the children's market and 1.4% of the women's and less than one-half of 1% of the market for men's shoes.","start":397.197,"stop":417.165,"duration":19.97},{"text":"And we come to the question whether the vertical effect of this merger would substantially lessen the competition -- might substantially lessen the competition in any line of commerce, in any section of the country.","start":417.165,"stop":433.256,"duration":16.09},{"text":"Our argument which I think I outlined before is that Brown's capture of Kinney's outlets violates Section 7 because its tendency will be to foreclose competition and send -- selling shoes to Kinney and that this segment of the market, the Kinney segment under all the circumstances of this industry is substantial.","start":433.256,"stop":454.586,"duration":21.33},{"text":"So that the three elements, we must attend to.","start":454.586,"stop":457.694,"duration":3.11},{"text":"First, we must define the market in terms of the section of the country and the product or line of commerce.","start":457.694,"stop":465.354,"duration":7.66},{"text":"Second, I have to address myself to the question, is there a reasonably likelihood that the acquisition will lessen the competition.","start":465.354,"stop":473.451,"duration":8.1},{"text":"And then third, I must show, of course, that the substantial share of the market is affected.","start":473.451,"stop":480.231,"duration":6.78},{"text":"Geographically, the market is a matter of common agreement, so far as manufacturer's market is concerned that that's what we're now talking about.","start":480.231,"stop":489.108,"duration":8.88},{"text":"Geographically, we all agree that it's nationwide.","start":489.108,"stop":491.918,"duration":2.81},{"text":"And there's no reason to discuss that any further.","start":491.918,"stop":495.669,"duration":3.75},{"text":"In terms of the product or line of commerce, the District Court found that the relevant market was for men's shoes, women's shoes and children's shoes.","start":495.669,"stop":507.009,"duration":11.34},{"text":"And I turn to the question in a moment whether those findings are supported by the elements.","start":507.009,"stop":512.847,"duration":5.84},{"text":"It seems to me important first to direct our minds and little bit to the question of what are we looking for and why are we looking for it.","start":512.847,"stop":519.878,"duration":7.03},{"text":"When we talk about line of commerce or market, as I see

any section, are those distributed terms or is that a unified collective terms.","start":524.475,"stop":537.396,"duration":12.92},{"text":"In other words, it must have been a line of commerce in any

yes.","start":569.259,"stop":570.793,"duration":1.53},{"text":"But, I would also think that if you had the whole country, a fortiori you had it in the
