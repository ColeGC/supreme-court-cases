Court.","start":15.97,"stop":20.624,"duration":4.65},{"text":"These are two cases hereon certiorari to the Court of Appeals to the Fifth Circuit.","start":20.624,"stop":27.127,"duration":6.5},{"text":"The question presented is whether injuries sustained by shipyard employees while working on vessels under construction but which have been launched and are float on navigable waters are compensable under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act.","start":27.127,"stop":46.62,"duration":19.49},{"text":"The facts on which this question arises differ in immaterial respect for case to case but they are substantially identical, indeed identical in all material respect and the Travelers Insurance case, the first case, will serve to illustrate both.","start":46.62,"stop":65.544,"duration":18.92},{"text":"The insured -- the Levingston Shipbuilding Company operated the shipyard on the Sabine River which flows between Texas and Louisiana.","start":65.544,"stop":75.757,"duration":10.21},{"text":"It's engaged both in new constructions of new vessels and in the repair of vessels which are previously been put into service.","start":75.757,"stop":85.941,"duration":10.18},{"text":"Unquestionably, many of its employees are engaged in maritime employment and therefore undeniably, Levingston was an employer covered by the Longshoremen's Act.","start":85.941,"stop":99.644,"duration":13.7},{"text":"McGuyer, the employee who was killed was employed by Levingston as a welder to work indiscriminately at repairing vessels which had been in service or taken out of service for repairs and also at completing vessels which were under construction.","start":99.644,"stop":119.739,"duration":20.1},{"text":"On the day in question, he was working on the superstructure of a building rig, a vessel which had been launched and was floating in the navigable waters of the Sabine River but it had not been completed and therefore had not been put into service.","start":119.739,"stop":137.057,"duration":17.32},{"text":"There was an explosion and the cause of which is immaterial, McGuyer suffered very severe injuries of which a week later caused his death.","start":137.057,"stop":148.841,"duration":11.78},{"text":"In seeking compensation for these injuries sustained in the course of his employment, McGuyer's family had to choose between seeking compensation under the federal statute or under the Texas Act which has agreed would've been the applicable state statute even though the injury happened to occur over on the Louisiana side of the river.","start":148.841,"stop":173.292,"duration":24.45},{"text":"Under the Texas Act, the widow would receive $35 a week for 360 weeks.","start":173.292,"stop":180.224,"duration":6.93},{"text":"That would be the maximum, or a total of $12,600.","start":180.224,"stop":185.673,"duration":5.45},{"text":"Under the federal statute,

minority.","start":185.673,"stop":201.53,"duration":15.86},{"text":"This would make a total maximum compensation to Mrs. McGuyer and the children of $83,500 or approximately six and half times to some payable under the Texas Act.","start":201.53,"stop":217.357,"duration":15.83},{"text":"Mrs. McGuyer in fact filed claims under both the Texas and federal statutes but the Texas claim was expressly made subject to the claims under the Federal Act.","start":217.357,"stop":229.575,"duration":12.22},{"text":"The Deputy Commissioner, conducting a hearing on the claim under the Federal Act at first found that this was not a covered injury.","start":229.575,"stop":241.324,"duration":11.75},{"text":"The case was then carried by the widow to the District Court and while it was pending there, the Deputy Commissioner asked to have it remanded.","start":241.324,"stop":250.396,"duration":9.07},{"text":"It was remanded.","start":250.396,"stop":252.052,"duration":1.66},{"text":"The Deputy Commissioner then made a new finding and then awarded compensation to the widow and minor children.","start":252.052,"stop":262.017,"duration":9.97},{"text":"That award was taken to the District Court by the Insurance Company, the respondent here.","start":262.017,"stop":267.9,"duration":5.88},{"text":"The District Court ruled that they're -- McGuyer had been engaged in covered employment and that therefore the injury was compensable under the federal statute.","start":267.9,"stop":279.242,"duration":11.34},{"text":"The gist of its opinion is at page 40 of the record.","start":279.242,"stop":284.192,"duration":4.95},{"text":"The Court said in a short opinion, “Here, McGuyer's death arose out of it in the course of his employment and since Levingston had

widow and children are entitled to compensation under the Act.","start":302.176,"stop":306.303,"duration":4.13},{"text":"So you're not -- the District Court made the right to compensation turn on three facts which we think are decisive.","start":306.303,"stop":314.829,"duration":8.53},{"text":"First, that the Levingston Shipbuilding Company, the employer, admittedly had the employees engaged in maritime employment.","start":314.829,"stop":324.605,"duration":9.78},{"text":"Second, that the injury occurred in the course of McGuyer's work and as a result of his employment.","start":324.605,"stop":333.63,"duration":9.02},{"text":"And third, that it occurred upon navigable water and we think were those three facts here the Federal Act

statute.","start":570.251,"stop":578.349,"duration":8.1},{"text":"The company took the case to the District Court, a different District Court, I may say than the Levingston Shipbuilding case went to and that district judge also sustained the award that's upholding the coverage of the Federal Act.","start":578.349,"stop":596.657,"duration":18.31},{"text":"The cases were argued on the same day in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and both were substantially decided in the opinion in the first case.","start":596.657,"stop":608.303,"duration":11.65},{"text":"The Court held squarely that employees injured while working on the construction of a new vessel even though it has been launched and float in navigable water, must obtain compensation under the state law and may not obtain compensation under the Federal Act.","start":608.303,"stop":629.794,"duration":21.49},{"text":"The opinion, I think, really stands on two legs.","start":629.794,"stop":635.394,"duration":5.6},{"text":"First, the Court drew a very sharp distinction between the completion of a new vessel and the repair of an existing vessel.","start":635.394,"stop":645.828,"duration":10.43},{"text":"Now, of course, both types of work when the vessel is in float are within the maritime jurisdiction.","start":645.828,"stop":653.645,"duration":7.82},{"text":"But the new construction the Court -- the Fifth -- the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said, it's within the category maritime but local so that the state law can apply and therefore it said, “The Federal Act cannot apply.”","start":653.645,"stop":669.416,"duration":15.77},{"text":"The second leg of the Court's opinion was to go back to the early president in Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company against Rohde, a case decided before the enactment of the Longshoremen's Act.","start":669.416,"stop":683.61,"duration":14.19},{"text":"And to say that since that case held that an employee engaged in new construction upon navigable waters on a floating (Inaudible), could recover under a state Longshoremen's Act, therefore, he could not recover under the federal law.","start":683.61,"stop":701.001,"duration":17.39},{"text":"There are two consequences of this distinction and reasoning that I'd like to advert too very quickly, the first is that it makes the compensation, to employee like -- employees like these, turn entirely on the happenstance of whether on a particular day they are on a new home or upon an old house being repaired because they are employed like many of -- these both were employed like any -- many other workers to work indiscriminately on new construction and repair.","start":701.001,"stop":737.86,"duration":36.86},{"text":"The second point I would simply mention briefly at this day is that the drawing of this distinction led the court below into a dictum which I think is revealing of its error because it is squarely contrary to two recent decisions of this Court.","start":737.86,"stop":759.081,"duration":21.22},{"text":"In drawing this distinction between new construction and repair, the Court flatly stated that if the men were engaged in repair work, they must sue under the state law and could not recover under the Federal Law because this is squarely inconsistent with the decisions of this Court in the more vast cases.","start":759.081,"stop":782.589,"duration":23.51},{"text":"Both of which hold that employees engaged in repair work may recover under the state statute and I think while this is the not -- is the other half of the pair than the case we have here that it is the converse and shows the essential error in the court below.","start":782.589,"stop":803.323,"duration":20.73},{"text":"Now the critical words of the statute are conveniently found on pages two and three of our brief.","start":803.323,"stop":812.784,"duration":9.46},{"text":"At the top of page three, you will find the definition of employer.","start":812.784,"stop":819.361,"duration":6.58},{"text":"The term employer means an employer any of whose employees are employed in maritime employment in whole or in part on navigable waters of the United States including any dry dock.","start":819.361,"stop":833.236,"duration":13.88},{"text":"And this plainly encompasses both the respondents in these cases.","start":833.236,"stop":838.52,"duration":5.28},{"text":"Then Section 3 (a) 903 of the Code, provides compensation should be payable under these chapter with respect of disability or death of an employee which incorporates by reference as you see the definition of employer and employee but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States including any dry dock, we admittedly meet that requirement.","start":838.52,"stop":868.601,"duration":30.08},{"text":"And if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by state law of the critical question in this case stated in general terms is whether that concluding proviso or qualification, if recovery for disability or death may not be validly provided by state law, bars federal compensation here because through the tolerance or sufferance of admiralty, prior to 1927, states had been allowed to give state compensation under the conditions obtained in here.","start":868.601,"stop":917.211,"duration":48.61},{"text":"In answering these question, there is one premise which must be borne in mind and that is whatever may have been the initial intention in this respect, it is plainly clear today that the statute does not make state and federal compensation mutually exclusive in all cases, and that, I say, whatever may I have been the initial meaning of this language, has now become a premise so well established that I think it takes no argument.","start":917.211,"stop":949.298,"duration":32.09},{"text":"This is the statute which has evolved in role to meet real conditions and we interpret it in the light of present and not simply going back to earlier interpretation as it was a bare colloc -- bare collocation of words.","start":949.298,"stop":968.309,"duration":19.01},{"text":"In our view, the concluding portion does not bar recovery under the federal statute, and as I said before, we think the federal statute applies where the three significant factors that I mentioned in the discussion with Mr. Justice Stewart are brought out.","start":968.309,"stop":987.989,"duration":19.68},{"text":"We find support for this view in the legislative history and background of the statute.","start":987.989,"stop":995.072,"duration":7.08},{"text":"We think it is plainly sustained by the decisions of this Court and indeed except for some recent decisions in the Fifth Circuit by the uniform course of decisions for 20 years in the Court of Appeals.","start":995.072,"stop":1009.58,"duration":14.51},{"text":"And finally, we urge that even if these contentions were not enough alone to make out petition in this case, even then under the twilight zone doctrine, established by Davis against Department of Labor, the award of compensation should've been sustained.","start":1009.58,"stop":1028.776,"duration":19.2},{"text":"I think it would be helpful at this point before coming to those three contentions, if I were to recall for the Court, the background against which the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act were mentioned and also, I recognized, the Court has been offered a good many times.","start":1028.776,"stop":1049.463,"duration":20.69},{"text":"You will recall and I can do it by referring to three cases.","start":1049.463,"stop":1054.664,"duration":5.2},{"text":"You will recall first that the Jensen case laid down the proposition of constitutional law that injuries occurring within the jurisdiction of the admiralty courts were not compensable under state statutes because admiralty law required uniformity and therefore the diverse rules of the 48 states might not be applied and that distinction was subsequently extended in two cases, the Knickerbocker Ice and Dawson cases to hold that Congress could not permit the states to apply their compensation statutes in this area.","start":1054.664,"stop":1101.818,"duration":47.15},{"text":"The second case that I would refer to is this case of Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company against Rohde, which introduced the so-called doctrine of maritime but local.","start":1101.818,"stop":1116.888,"duration":15.07},{"text":"In Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company against Rohde, an employee was injured while engaged in new construction of a ship which was afloat on the navigable water.","start":1116.888,"stop":1132.442,"duration":15.55},{"text":"He had been employed to engage only in new construction.","start":1132.442,"stop":1138.446,"duration":6},{"text":"His employment contract contained references expressed or implied to the state compensation act and the state compensation act provided that an employee who elected to come under the Act should be deemed to have waived his rights under the substantive law of torts to sue for personal injury.","start":1138.446,"stop":1163.144,"duration":24.7},{"text":"And the particular case which ultimately came to this Court was a suit in tort to recover for personal injuries but it was held that the employee was barred by his acceptance rights under the state law and that the state compensation act could apply because the Court said, this was maritime but local.","start":1163.144,"stop":1190.321,"duration":27.18},{"text":"Many of the commentators striated the Rohde case as they retreat in part from Jensen.","start":1190.321,"stop":1197.554,"duration":7.23},{"text":"There were a series of five or six cases in this Court that applied the doctrine and the various other kinds of employees.","start":1197.554,"stop":1208.55,"duration":11},{"text":"The third case, I need to mention only briefly, Industrial Commission against Nordenholt Corporation which drew the line between state and federal -- between -- through the permissible line of state acts in such a way between the ship and the dock so that even if the dock reached out in the navigable waters, if the injury occurred on the dock, the state law might be applied.","start":1208.55,"stop":1238.5,"duration":29.95},{"text":"I mentioned this case because it's one of the things to which the concluding words of Section 903 might be taken to apply.","start":1238.5,"stop":1247.985,"duration":9.48},{"text":"So the question here stated in the length of its background -- of the background of the Longshoremen's Act is whether this concluding if clause -- if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation, may not be validly provided by state law is to be held to incorporate into the Federal Act a limitation on the cover of which excludes from the Federal Act this pre-1927 category of maritime but local.","start":1247.985,"stop":1284.944,"duration":36.96},{"text":"Our first point is that the legislative history shows that the Congress did not have any intention -- affirmative intention to incorporate in the Section 903 the doctrine of maritime but local.","start":1284.944,"stop":1307.598,"duration":22.65},{"text":"I stated in terms but did not have any intention to incorporate it because I do think that this is a statute of which must be interpreted as I have said earlier in the length of developments since it's neck but if there were clear evidence that Congress laid stress on the maritime but local doctrine, naturally, that would give us a pause in arguing that it was not effective law today but quite contraries the case.","start":1307.598,"stop":1336.054,"duration":28.46},{"text":"Well, I do not know that one could press so far as to say that the legislative history shows affirmatively that the doctrine was repudiated.","start":1336.054,"stop":1344.315,"duration":8.26},{"text":"It certainly finds more in that direction than it did in any direction of preserving it or attaching importance to it.","start":1344.315,"stop":1353.811,"duration":9.5},{"text":"The bill of which ultimately was enacted, originated in the Senate and it's interesting to note that the original Senate Bill did incorporate the maritime but local doctrine.","start":1353.811,"stop":1369.578,"duration":15.77},{"text":"We've set forth the relevant excerpt on page 32 of our brief.","start":1369.578,"stop":1376.89,"duration":7.31},{"text":"This actually apply to any employment performed on a place within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States except employment of local concern and of no direct relation to navigation and commerce which will not apply to imply if he's a master or a member of the crew of a vessel.","start":1376.89,"stop":1395.241,"duration":18.35},{"text":"In the hearings, those critical words which are taken from the Rohde case, employment of local concern and of no direction, no direct relation to navigation and commerce were explained as coming from the Rohde case and were severely criticized, indeed in a written memorandum filed some time after the conclusion of the

intended to take out of the federal statute and give to the states jurisdiction over injuries occurring on fixed structures built out into the water like a long jet or something of that kind because
