cause.","start":89.56,"stop":95.239,"duration":5.68},{"text":"The Court of Appeals so-held and the government does not contest it.","start":95.239,"stop":99.33,"duration":4.09},{"text":"The court below held that since the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe that there was a violation of the narcotics law, therefore, under the Narcotic Control Act, the arrest was lawful and the search, as an incident thereto, was reasonable.","start":99.33,"stop":116.774,"duration":17.44},{"text":"However, I respectfully submit to Your Honors that if the judgment of the lower court be affirmed, the narcotics agents can largely ignore the Fourth Amendment.","start":116.774,"stop":128.518,"duration":11.74},{"text":"They can enter a suspect's home irrespective of the time of night or day upon reasonable ground to believe that a suspect had committed a crime no matter when the crime was committed.","start":128.518,"stop":140.099,"duration":11.58},{"text":"In our particular case, it

contraband was going to be destroyed or that the suspect was fleeing or likely to flee and also taking into consideration the fact that this was a private dwelling and not a movable vehicle.","start":144.603,"stop":165.838,"duration":21.23},{"text":"And, where it clearly appears, as in our case, that the narcotics agents had more than ample time to obtain a search warrant, six months, there is no evidence adduced by the government that the agents, at the time or prior to the arrest, had reasonable ground to believe that the petitioner was committing a crime nor did they see him commit a crime.","start":165.838,"stop":191.673,"duration":25.84},{"text":"This would permit, in effect, the arresting officer to bypass the magistrate to become the judicial officer, the arresting officer, and the one conducting the search, and I most respectfully submit to Your Honors that this would be a dangerous amalgamation of power.","start":191.673,"stop":210.258,"duration":18.59},{"text":"Now, Congress, in enacting the Narcotic Control Act, was particularly concerned about those emergent circumstances where, if the agent had to obtain a warrant, the suspect would flee or the contraband would be destroyed.","start":210.258,"stop":225.676,"duration":15.42},{"text":"And, as we read the remarks by the senators and the congressmen concerning this particular bit of legislation and the reports of the various committees, that's what they were concerned about.","start":225.676,"stop":238.276,"duration":12.6},{"text":"They didn't want to put the narcotics agents in a select class above and distinct and apart from all other agents, but they recognize it and I recognize it, too, that if they -- if an agent had to go to a magistrate when a man was hawking his narcotics on the street, of course, it would be absurd and ridiculous.","start":238.276,"stop":257.547,"duration":19.27},{"text":"By the time they got back, the narcotic trafficker would disappear, the contraband would be destroyed.","start":257.547,"stop":263.459,"duration":5.91},{"text":"But, it is only in those emergent circumstances that this legislation was enacted.","start":263.459,"stop":269.066,"duration":5.61},{"text":"Those circumstances are not present in our case.","start":269.066,"stop":271.983,"duration":2.92},{"text":"We have a very, very unusual situation.","start":271.983,"stop":275.534,"duration":3.55},{"text":"At the time of the argument, the government did not submit one affidavit from any of the arresting officers to justify their entrance into this man's apartment.","start":275.534,"stop":286.581,"duration":11.05},{"text":"United States Attorney, the assistant did submit an affidavit, which he candidly admit it was based upon information and belief in which he says \"we saw the man seated in his house in his living room at 8:50 in the evening and we went inside and we arrested him under this whole invalid warrant and then we conducted a search.\"","start":286.581,"stop":306.939,"duration":20.36},{"text":"As noted by Judge Waterman in his dissenting opinion, there is no case in this Court upholding the search of a home by officers having neither an arrest warrant nor a search warrant.","start":306.939,"stop":319.695,"duration":12.76},{"text":"And, in the Roy Jones case, 357 United States, the government, for the first time, contended that agents had authority under federal law to enter a house, make an arrest based upon probable cause, and then to seize contraband that was visible.","start":319.695,"stop":338.333,"duration":18.64},{"text":"However, this Court said these contentions would confront us with a grave constitutional question, namely, whether forceful nighttime entry into a dwelling to arrest a person reasonably believed to be within there, upon probable cause, that he had committed a felony under circumstances where no reason appears why arrest -- an arrest warrant could not have been obtained is consistent with the Fourth Amendment.","start":338.333,"stop":368.289,"duration":29.96},{"text":"However, this issue was not determined because, from the testimony, it was clearly apparent that the arrest was but a mere pretext to make the search.","start":368.289,"stop":379.783,"duration":11.49},{"text":"And so, in our case, it is our contention, too, that this whole invalid warrant that was used was but a mere pretext to make the search.","start":379.783,"stop":389.314,"duration":9.53},{"text":"The government concedes, in its brief, that the petitioner was under close surveillance immediately proceeding, during, and after the narcotics transaction.","start":389.314,"stop":399.53,"duration":10.22},{"text":"It further admits in its brief that, no doubt, the agents did controvert a search of the premises for narcotics as an incident to petitioner's arrest if he were arrested in his home.","start":399.53,"stop":410.643,"duration":11.11},{"text":"This man was under surveillance for a period of six months.","start":410.643,"stop":414.105,"duration":3.46},{"text":"The agents undoubtedly could've arrested him at any time outside of his dwelling, but they knew that if they arrested him on the sidewalk in front of his house, they could not go into his apartment and make a search.","start":414.105,"stop":427.279,"duration":13.17},{"text":"They knew they could not obtain a search warrant because, during the entire five months period that they have the invalid warrant of arrest, no incriminating factors appeared.","start":427.279,"stop":439.152,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Now, a search warrant had already been denied by the United States Commissioner.","start":439.152,"stop":443.682,"duration":4.53},{"text":"So, therefore, they took the bull by the horns and they said, \"Well, if we're going to make the search, we're going to use this warrant that we have.","start":443.682,"stop":452.47,"duration":8.79},{"text":"We're going to go into the apartment, arrest this man on that warrant, and then we're going to conduct the search.\"","start":452.47,"stop":459.257,"duration":6.79},{"text":"And, we further contend that a warrant with arrest is no different than arrest under a warrant, both must be executed within a reasonable period of time and the six months waiting period is not a reasonable period of time.","start":459.257,"stop":475.275,"duration":16.02},{"text":"Of course, the government has the right to wait for certain circumstance to develop in order to spring the trap, as we said in the Robinowitz case, but that doesn't give them the right to wait month after month after month when no incriminating factors appear.","start":475.275,"stop":492.482,"duration":17.21}]},{"speakerName":"Charles E. Whittaker","textObjs":[{"text":"Is that an issue up here?","start":492.482,"stop":494.079,"duration":1.6},{"text":"I thought the Court of Appeals had held the arrest warrant invalid for defects in its issuance.","start":494.079,"stop":501.79,"duration":7.71}]},{"speakerName":"Jerome Lewis","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, sir.","start":501.79,"stop":502.755,"duration":0.96}]},{"speakerName":"Charles E.

the arrest.","start":502.755,"stop":514.568,"duration":11.81}]},{"speakerName":"Jerome Lewis","textObjs":[{"text":"I submit to you, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that the arrest was unlawful because it was a stale arrest and, therefore, any search as an incident to an unlawful stale arrest is, in effect, unlawful and not permissible.","start":514.568,"stop":531.558,"duration":16.99},{"text":"And, that is what Judge Waterman stated in his opinion, that the government can't wait six months on a warrant with arrest and to go into a man's home and then make an arrest.","start":531.558,"stop":544.361,"duration":12.8},{"text":"He said that was a stale arrest and an unlawful arrest and the fact that you can have reasonable grounds to believe that a crime was committed, you cannot wait indefinitely.","start":544.361,"stop":554.914,"duration":10.55},{"text":"And, my research and Judge Waterman's research also, we have found no case where more than a month elapsed that an arrest, under those circumstances, were held to be justifiable.","start":554.914,"stop":568.027,"duration":13.11},{"text":"In effect -- in fact, most of the cases hold that the government cannot hold back an arrest with the mere expectation and hope that, certainly, some criminal activities may come into the -- come into being.","start":568.027,"stop":582.835,"duration":14.81},{"text":"They waited six months here and, without any other incriminating factors, they went into this man's home.","start":582.835,"stop":589.726,"duration":6.89},{"text":"Now, our Constitution says that a warrant must be executed within a reasonable period of time.","start":589.726,"stop":595.953,"duration":6.23},{"text":"We submit, a warrant with arrest is in the same category.","start":595.953,"stop":599.533,"duration":3.58},{"text":"Congress, by giving the agents the right to make a warrantless arrest, certainly did not carve out by statute the necessity or a greater liberality than tho -- than we have under our Constitution and I say that, if under a warrant of arrest an execution must be within a reasonable time and six months is not, then a warrantless arrest falls into the same category and it, therefore, follows that since this arrest, assuming they had reasonable grounds, of course which we deny, then this arrest was stale and unlawful and any search as an incident to a stale arrest must of course, therefore, be unlawful.","start":599.533,"stop":642.89,"duration":43.36},{"text":"Now, it is our further contention that the agents did not have probable cause to arrest the petitioner.","start":642.89,"stop":651.485,"duration":8.6},{"text":"Back in October 1958, Agents Monaghan and Costa from the Federal Narcotics Bureau submitted two affidavits in support of their application for a search warrant.","start":651.485,"stop":661.987,"duration":10.5},{"text":"The search warrant was denied by the United States Commissioner.","start":661.987,"stop":665.991,"duration":4},{"text":"In Monaghan's affidavit, he said that he met one Panzarella in August of 1958.","start":665.991,"stop":672.81,"duration":6.82},{"text":"They had some discussion about purchasing narcotics.","start":672.81,"stop":676.436,"duration":3.63},{"text":"Panzarella said, \"I'm going to call up my connection.","start":676.436,"stop":678.701,"duration":2.26},{"text":"I'll let you know.\"","start":678.701,"stop":679.746,"duration":1.04},{"text":"He made a phone call, came back to Monaghan, they went from Manhattan to the County of Queens, Monaghan saw Panzarella go into a green Chrysler car which was owned by the petitioner, Pan -- Di Bella.","start":679.746,"stop":696.756,"duration":17.01},{"text":"Panzarella, then, emerged from the car and gave an envelope containing heroin to the agent.","start":696.756,"stop":703.488,"duration":6.73},{"text":"The same process was repeated in September of 1958 but this time, in addition, Panzarella is alleged to have said to the agent \"Di Bella is my source of supply.\"","start":703.488,"stop":716.659,"duration":13.17},{"text":"Now, Agent Costa says that he had Di Bella under observation.","start":716.659,"stop":722.591,"duration":5.93},{"text":"He saw Panzarella enter the car.","start":722.591,"stop":725.268,"duration":2.68},{"text":"He didn't see anything pass between the two of them.","start":725.268,"stop":728.553,"duration":3.28},{"text":"He saw them in the car and, later, he saw Panzarella leave the car and joined Agent Monaghan.","start":728.553,"stop":734.643,"duration":6.09},{"text":"He was familiar with this alleged conversation because Monaghan told him that Panzarella had said that Di Bella was his source of supply.","start":734.643,"stop":745.564,"duration":10.92},{"text":"Now, the lower court held that probable cause existed and cited the Jones case, the Cecil Jones case in 362 U.S.","start":745.564,"stop":755.639,"duration":10.08},{"text":"Now, Judge Waterman, in his dissenting opinion, believed that the facts in this case were even weaker than in the Henry case.","start":755.639,"stop":763.037,"duration":7.4},{"text":"Well, he stated that, in the Jones case, the officer, a detective by the name of Didone stated that he had received information from this informer, that this man was a reliable informant, and that he had received reliable information from him prior thereto, that the defendants or the suspects were narcotic addicts and that the detective had received reliable information from other reliable resources.","start":763.037,"stop":793.797,"duration":30.76},{"text":"But, in our case, Panzarella was not a reliable informant.","start":793.797,"stop":798.618,"duration":4.82},{"text":"He had never given information to the federal agents before.","start":798.618,"stop":803.391,"duration":4.77},{"text":"There is no evidence that Di Bella was a narcotics user and there was no further evidence and information given by any other reliable source that Di Bella was involved in narcotics.","start":803.391,"stop":815.46,"duration":12.07},{"text":"Now, if I remember correctly, in the Cecil Jones case, it was said that of all the detective could go by was the fact that he had been told that the informant had purchased narcotics from the defendant.","start":815.46,"stop":830.042,"duration":14.58},{"text":"That would not be enough.","start":830.042,"stop":831.693,"duration":1.65},{"text":"There must be corroborating factors to sustain the information given by the informant, and Judge Waterman argued in his opinion that the fact that two men are seen in an automobile and nothing is passed between the two of them is not the same type of corroboration that this Court held was valid in the Cecil Jones case.","start":831.693,"stop":853.768,"duration":22.08},{"text":"And so, I submit to Your Honor, assuming arguendo now that there was reasonable for grounds for this agent to enter a man's home six months after an alleged crime had been committed, in the absence of any special necessitous circumstances, just merely seeing a man seated in his living room not knowing that he had contraband there, not knowing that he was going to flee, where they could've arrested him at any time they wanted but, of course, knowing that if they arrested him outside of his home, they couldn't go into his home and obtain a warrant, where the facts are just like in this Roy Jones case and in the Lefkowitz case that they were using it merely as a pretext.","start":853.768,"stop":899.06,"duration":45.29},{"text":"They didn't want to arrest this man.","start":899.06,"stop":900.63,"duration":1.57},{"text":"They could've done it at any time they wanted to, but they weren't until they get into his apartment and then to arrest him and make a search as an incident thereto.","start":900.63,"stop":910.049,"duration":9.42},{"text":"If that is permitted, I will say -- I say most deferentially to Your Honors that a narcotics agent will never have to obtain a search warrant.","start":910.049,"stop":920.927,"duration":10.88},{"text":"He'll never have to obtain a warrant of arrest because an arrest under probable cause, under the Narcotics Control Act, then would be equivalent to a general search warrant.","start":920.927,"stop":933.2,"duration":12.27},{"text":"He could bypass the Magistrate with impunity.","start":933.2,"stop":936.262,"duration":3.06},{"text":"He becomes a law unto himself.","start":936.262,"stop":938.931,"duration":2.67},{"text":"He can enter a man's home any time that he wants, no matter when alleged crime was committed in the night, 2:00 in the morning, rouse him out of bed and make an arrest then conduct the search.","start":938.931,"stop":951.474,"duration":12.54},{"text":"Certainly, our lawmakers never contemplated that when they enacted the Narcotics Control Act which was strictly confined to those emergent circumstances where if the agents didn't act with dispatch and under the exigencies that existed, why, the narcotic trafficker would flee or the contraband would be destroyed.","start":951.474,"stop":971.001,"duration":19.53},{"text":"And, we haven't -- we do not have that in this particular case and I say, to permit such unparalleled power to be given to narcotics agents would be a dangerous precedent and an emasculation of the Fourth Amendment.","start":971.001,"stop":986.012,"duration":15.01},{"text":"Now, Your Honors, I have not said one word about the appeal of penalty question.","start":986.012,"stop":990.603,"duration":4.59},{"text":"I believe it's not properly before this Court because the government is asking

order.","start":990.603,"stop":1005.328,"duration":14.73},{"text":"I say that, since the government wants affirmative relief, they should have cross-petitioned for that relief, and I'm not arguing at
