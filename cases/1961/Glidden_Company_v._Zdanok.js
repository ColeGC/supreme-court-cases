statute.","start":244.92,"stop":267.901,"duration":22.98},{"text":"Now, before I get to the heart of the constitutional issue, there are several preliminary considerations which I would like to

of action which Article III gives to judges of Article III courts.","start":288.922,"stop":325.305,"duration":36.38},{"text":"And that to deny him that claim, that right, we suggest, is to deny this

Evans against Gore and reiterated in the O'Donoghue case.","start":349.259,"stop":387.223,"duration":37.96},{"text":"They are not a private grant to the judges

think it was put in there primarily to -- as the Evans against Gore points out that in order to ensure that the guarantees and other provisions of the Constitution are properly administered and applied by the judges of Article III courts, that it was absolutely essential that the judges be given constitutional independence of action and they could only do that by giving them life tenure and by protecting them from any diminution in their compensation.","start":397.867,"stop":434.909,"duration":37.04},{"text":"Now, I think necessarily follows from that that the litigants and the

it.","start":455.201,"stop":465.944,"duration":10.74},{"text":"But I think that one way of saying that from another angle is simply that there's been no due process accorded him.","start":465.944,"stop":473.273,"duration":7.33},{"text":"But I don't want to pursue that situation because I think as you say, the -- the complete answer is if I am right, law in the fact that this Judge was not authorized under the Constitution to sit in this case or to render judgment.","start":473.273,"stop":493.342,"duration":20.07},{"text":"In that respect, I submit further that it is no answer as the Government seems to suggest that Judge Jackson has life tenure by virtue of a congressional enactment in 1930.","start":493.342,"stop":510.276,"duration":16.93},{"text":"Whatever statutory protections of tenure or salary that Judge Jackson may have is no substitute for the constitutional requirements, the constitutional protection which can only be given to an Article III judge and simply because Congress is seen fit to give life tenure to a so-called non-Article III judge does not thereby satisfy the constitutional claim which I am here asserting, a claim which requires and necessitates that the life tenure and the protection against salary compensation diminutions come from the Constitution from Article III, Section 1 and not from any statutory enactment.","start":510.276,"stop":565.086,"duration":54.81},{"text":"And I might say that as I will develop later, that Congress in this instance has demonstrated an ability and a constitutional right to cut the salaries of judges such as Judge Jackson as they did in fact in 1932.","start":565.086,"stop":585.159,"duration":20.07},{"text":"But moreover, this constitutional claim which petitioner is here asserting is one which very definitely can be raised and pursued by this petitioner as an inhabitant of the District of Columbia because the O'Donoghue case completely answers any contrary claim by demonstrating and ruling that District of Columbia inhabitants are not less fortified by the guarantee of an independent judiciary than in other parts of the union and that they too like the inhabitants of all the other 50 states, have the right to have their cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States heard and determined, I'm quoting, “By federal courts

claim which I am asserting, which is a constitutional claim by this petitioner, was that regardless of what might be said with respect to Article III of the Constitution, the complete answer is to be found.","start":658.038,"stop":675.758,"duration":17.72},{"text":"They said in another section of the Constitution to with the district clause of Article I which is in Section 8 Clause 17 of Article I.","start":675.758,"stop":685.766,"duration":10.01},{"text":"So they said, “We will avoid any determination of your claim under Article III because we feel that the complete answer is to be found under the District of Columbia Clause.","start":685.766,"stop":698.415,"duration":12.65},{"text":"Now, that District of Columbia Clause merely reads that the Congress shall have exclusive jurisdiction to legislate for the National Seat of Government or the District of Columbia.","start":698.415,"stop":711.529,"duration":13.11},{"text":"And it has been viewed as a rather plenary congressional power.","start":711.529,"stop":717.228,"duration":5.7},{"text":"Well, be that as it may, the complete answer to the -- to the analysis rendered by the Court of Appeals below on that ground again is to be found in the O'Donaghue case in 289 United States, which demonstrates that that District of Columbia Clause is not to be read in a vacuum and it is not inconsistent with the application of Article III of the Constitution.","start":717.228,"stop":747.675,"duration":30.45},{"text":"Moreover, this Court said in O'Donaghue, it is not to be used and I quote, “To destroy the operative effect of the

asserting that Article III of the Constitution prohibits this assignment and requires that this case be heard and determined by an Article III judge, then it is no answer to that claim that the District of Columbia Clause provides any type of an answer because the two clauses are in no way inconsistent and the District of Columbia Clause is not to be used to prevent the operative effect of Article III.","start":762.768,"stop":803.606,"duration":40.84},{"text":"In other words, both the District of Columbia Clause and Article III must be read together, both of them must be applied and if
