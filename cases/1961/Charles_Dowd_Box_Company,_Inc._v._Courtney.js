specific amounts to individual members of the union in the form of wages alleged to be due under this contract.","start":235.131,"stop":257.331,"duration":22.2},{"text":"Now, I might point out here that the original action sought specific performance of the entire contracts which had many clauses in it -- with reference to union rights qua union such as recognition of the union, union shop, check off, as well as claiming violation of rights which would result in money damages to the individual members for wages alleged to be due.","start":257.331,"stop":289.512,"duration":32.18},{"text":"But the -- by the time the filed decree was entered in 1960, the original contract had expired, so that the question of specific

contract or the duration of that contract.","start":289.512,"stop":321.41,"duration":31.9},{"text":"The company appealed from the interlocutory decrees -- decree overruling the demurrer of the company in which it alleged no jurisdiction of the state court and from the lower court's motion to -- denial of the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction and from the final decree, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the rulings of the lower court in essence holding that the state court did have jurisdiction, not withstanding Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act that the Taft-Hartley -- the three -- Section 301 did not establish any exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts.","start":321.41,"stop":372.601,"duration":51.19},{"text":"Now, it may be of interest on the -- as the case arises here that in the findings of fact which are undisputed now in this case, there was a finding in the lower court that the company sells a substantial part of its product and purchases a substantial part of its supplies in interstate commerce.","start":372.601,"stop":393.898,"duration":21.3},{"text":"So I don't think there's any question here of whether the case involves one affecting the interstate

refused to comply with the contract and terminated it before its expiration date, and that the collective agreement for which specific performance was requested, was valid and contained the usual clauses which are incorporated in a collective agreement so that the case is one to which Section 301 obviously applies.","start":407.85,"stop":448.38,"duration":40.53},{"text":"It was brought by a labor organization against an employer for a violation of a contract between these parties expressly.","start":448.38,"stop":461.082,"duration":12.7},{"text":"The company was engaged in interstate commerce and I think that's undisputed so that this would affect interstate commerce suit conceivably and the suit sought specific performance of the entire contract so that it could not be said that this was a suit to maintain or prosecute uniquely personal rights as distinguished from rights of the union as a union, so that the Westinghouse problem is not yet present.","start":461.082,"stop":497.465,"duration":36.38},{"text":"I think it was not specifically that will force money judgments for individual members of the union although that was the final decree entered because the other issues had become moot in the process of the litigation.","start":497.465,"stop":518.133,"duration":20.67},{"text":"Now, the Section 301 and the inquiry I should say here presented follows in somewhat natural sequence from the Court's -- this Court's decision in the Lincoln Mills case, in Mills' case in 1957 where at least these phases of Section 301 were determined namely that Section 301 was not a procedural statute, but created substantive rights and established substantive law, and the Court went on to say that it did -- created a direction to the federal courts to fashion a body of federal law under Section 301.","start":518.133,"stop":567.042,"duration":48.91},{"text":"And the case further, I think for our purposes in this situation established that there were no constitutional difficulties involved in the enactment of Section 301 granting remedies or establishing a procedure for remedies for violation of collective agreements which were consummated between labor organizations and employers.","start":567.042,"stop":605.616,"duration":38.57},{"text":"Now I think that being in the sense behind this as far as the issues in this case are concerned we come then to the question -- the next question in sort of a logical sequence, if Section 301 established the substantive law beyond a mere procedural enactment, permitting a forum for enforcement of collective contracts in the federal courts and if this was constitutionally within the province of Congress to so enact in establishing a national labor policy, then I think it must be assumed that there – if there is no constitutional impediment to the interpretation and application of Section 301 as set forth in the Lincoln Mills case, then it must be assumed, I submit, that it was within the constitutional power of Congress to have granted exclusive jurisdiction for the enforcement of these rights to the federal courts if it so fit which would then bring us to the customary but often difficult question of proving the legislative intent in this respect.","start":605.616,"stop":698.06,"duration":92.44},{"text":"Then it becomes in this case a matter of interpretation of Section 301 as to whether Congress intended or the general pattern of this legislation and the general purpose of it would require an interpretation fairly that exclusive jurisdiction was vested in the federal courts when Section 301 was enacted.","start":698.06,"stop":731.093,"duration":33.03},{"text":"It might be helpful to orient ourselves to read the specific provision of 301 to the effect that Section (a), that suits for violation of contracts between an employer and labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this Act or between any such labor organizations may be brought in any District Court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties without respect for the amount of controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.","start":731.093,"stop":768.327,"duration":37.23},{"text":"And it would seem that the specific statutory language and the general pattern of the legislation would in the first instance be the primary source to inquiring the legislative intent.","start":768.327,"stop":785.359,"duration":17.03},{"text":"And one of the arguments that has been made with reference to this question of whether there is exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts or concurrent jurisdiction in both the federal and state courts as a result of Section 301 is that the word “may” is used that suits may be brought in any District Court which is not the language of a mandatory exclusive jurisdiction normally perhaps.","start":785.359,"stop":815.347,"duration":29.99},{"text":"But I submit that dramatically the “may” in this statute or in this clause is permissive to the federal courts without regard to the amount of controversy or the citizenship of the parties.","start":815.347,"stop":833.855,"duration":18.51},{"text":"In other words, it's permissive to the federal courts to act regardless of these restrictions which would otherwise apply.","start":833.855,"stop":841.466,"duration":7.61},{"text":"It is not permissive necessarily with respect to federal jurisdiction vis-à-vis state jurisdiction.","start":841.466,"stop":848.989,"duration":7.52},{"text":"I think this would be a fair use of the -- or analysis of the word “may” grammatically in this particular statute.","start":848.989,"stop":856.005,"duration":7.02},{"text":"But going beyond that language analysis, if we look at the pattern of the legislation itself, the Taft-Hartley Act, I think it becomes somewhat clear that where the Congress intended to permit state intervention in labor relations affecting commerce that in explicitly and expressly said so.","start":856.005,"stop":888.309,"duration":32.3},{"text":"For example, there is nothing presently in the Taft-Hartley Act which says that the Board has exclusive jurisdictional or unfair labor practices.","start":888.309,"stop":900.104,"duration":11.8},{"text":"However, it's now conceded without any possibility of controversy that -- and by interpretations of this Court that the power of the Board is exclusive even though that language is not used in the statute.","start":900.104,"stop":918.822,"duration":18.72},{"text":"Now, when the Court saw fit to grant exclusive or rather state power to act, it did so in express language, for example in Section 303 of the act which was enacted at the same time as 301, the language is that whoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason of any violation of subsection (a) which is the secondary boycott provision, may sue therefore in any District Court of the United States, subject to the limitation and provision of Section 301 without respect to the amount in controversy or in any other court having jurisdiction of the parties.","start":918.822,"stop":967.061,"duration":48.24},{"text":"So that when they wanted to grant and specifically say this Court -- state courts may intervene in that particular situation, enacted simultaneously with 301, they said or in any other court having jurisdiction of the parties.","start":967.061,"stop":981.923,"duration":14.86},{"text":"They did not use that language in Section 301, enacted at the same
