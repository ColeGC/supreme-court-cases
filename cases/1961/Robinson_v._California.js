of California essentially because we feel that it is a denial of equal protection and due process in that it punishes a status rather than an act or omission, that it punishes an involuntary status, that it punishes a status of physical and mental illness, that it is vague, indefinite and uncertain upon its face, that double jeopardy is inherent in any crime of status and certainly in this -- the present one and that this statute is unwarranted and unconstitutional infringement upon the freedom of movement, that it is ex post facto and that it imposes cruel and unusual punishment.","start":35.307,"stop":85.451,"duration":50.14},{"text":"Now, because our case is essentially an attack upon the law itself, the most crucial fact we have before us is the nature and the content or the necessary and implicit application of this law.","start":85.451,"stop":99.797,"duration":14.35},{"text":"However, because we have -- aside or collateral issue or a secondary issue challenge also the search and seizure aspect of this case under the rule of Memphis, Ohio, the recent decision of this Court and because we also feel that under Thompson versus City of Louisville, there is an adequate evidence to sustain the conviction or in fact no evidence at all and hence a denial of due process.","start":99.797,"stop":127.693,"duration":27.9},{"text":"The facts of the case will begin with the arrest itself.","start":127.693,"stop":132.829,"duration":5.14},{"text":"On a chilly or cold night in February of 1960, the present appellant was riding as a passenger in the backseat of a car accompanied by his lady friend and other party named Banks and his wife were in the front seat, Banks being the driver.","start":132.829,"stop":148,"duration":15.17},{"text":"The arresting officers testified that they stopped the vehicle because of an absence of rear license plate illumination.","start":148,"stop":158.979,"duration":10.98},{"text":"We feel that the facts as testified by the arresting officers, negative of their excuse for the stoppage and that they actually presented three or four different reasons.","start":158.979,"stop":171.871,"duration":12.89},{"text":"Secondly, we said that there was a car that driving slowly upon a dark unlit street and finally that they -- that their -- the territory in question had a reputation for person action and -- interesting also that these officers were not traffic officers, though their original justification, the one accepted by the Court was a traffic stopping.","start":171.871,"stop":194.613,"duration":22.74},{"text":"They were not traffic officers.","start":194.613,"stop":195.794,"duration":1.18},{"text":"They're not in a traffic

any party about driving too slowly, and this is admitted.","start":200.575,"stop":205.324,"duration":4.75},{"text":"And as soon as the stopping took place, they began actually a search of the parties involved to see if they were narcotic addicts of which, they had no indication prior to the stopping of the vehicle.","start":205.324,"stop":216.883,"duration":11.56},{"text":"So, since they were felony officers and were not traffic officers though we -- we do not question the right of any officer to make a traffic stopping or arrest.","start":216.883,"stop":226.781,"duration":9.9},{"text":"Since they were not traffic officers and did not have anything to do with traffic and stopping the car, we suspect that we have here the typical arrest, aroused arrest for the purpose of search to find whatever they might have found.","start":226.781,"stop":239.58,"duration":12.8},{"text":"In fact, one of the officers testified that when the driver Banks got out of the car, he shined his light about this person to find whatever he could find.","start":239.58,"stop":250.174,"duration":10.59},{"text":"And this of course is an admission of a general ex -- search to see what evidence of any crime might have been there present.","start":250.174,"stop":257.57,"duration":7.4},{"text":"But leave that as it may, upon the stopping, Banks left his vehicle and -- and met the officer halfway.","start":257.57,"stop":264.007,"duration":6.44},{"text":"And at this point, although it was a cold night of February and even of

admit having used heroin upon at least one occasion on 54th Street in the City of Los Angeles.","start":335.854,"stop":352.997,"duration":17.14},{"text":"And -- so, based upon this admission plus having seen scar tissue in -- in the arms of this appellant after having ordered to remove him his coat, he, like Banks, was also arrested and charged with -- with the offense of being a user under the influence of or addicted to the -- the drug in question or -- or a narcotic drug, the -- the actual which we granted.","start":352.997,"stop":379.083,"duration":26.09},{"text":"Now, the testimony, the only testimony on the trial which showed or intended to show any narcotic use at all was on a police officer who was attempted to be qualified as expert.","start":379.083,"stop":391.418,"duration":12.33},{"text":"The respondent says he was clearly qualified as an expert.","start":391.418,"stop":394.662,"duration":3.24},{"text":"But because narcotics addiction is what is, that's a serious question in my mind as whether or not a police officer has distinguished from a doctor or nurse or something of a medical nature is -- is ever really qualified to tell whether a person is a narcotic addict or not.","start":394.662,"stop":408.487,"duration":13.83},{"text":"This of course is -- is a question of arguable thing.","start":408.487,"stop":410.487,"duration":2},{"text":"We cert -- we don't rely upon it.","start":410.487,"stop":411.907,"duration":1.42},{"text":"But the only evidence was that of a police officer who stated that this appellant was not under the influence, was not an addict as far as he could see and he relies solely upon the use as shown by some marks on the man's arm.","start":411.907,"stop":427.051,"duration":15.14},{"text":"Now, of course, the marks themselves are stated to have been from 3 to about 20 days old from one arm from 3 to 10 days and other arm 15 to 20 days as I recall it.","start":427.051,"stop":440.364,"duration":13.31},{"text":"Of course, the appearance of the marks in the arms could not show where the narcotic had been injected.","start":440.364,"stop":447.675,"duration":7.31},{"text":"And of course, we have the rule of venue.","start":447.675,"stop":449.064,"duration":1.39},{"text":"I think generally certain in California on the case that we have cited that venue or the place where a crime was committed whether its murder or the injection of a narcotic must be shown.","start":449.064,"stop":458.905,"duration":9.84},{"text":"So the expert did not rely upon either influence or addiction.","start":458.905,"stop":462.845,"duration":3.94},{"text":"The court nevertheless instructed upon it and admittedly unproven aspect of the law, addiction as well as upon use.","start":462.845,"stop":471.574,"duration":8.73},{"text":"So we here have a conviction, we did not show clearly to have been either for use or for addiction.","start":471.574,"stop":477.311,"duration":5.74},{"text":"We know this more than the other, we must assume so because the court did instruct the jury that they must all find either use or addiction and not six days that he was user and the other six that he was an addict.","start":477.311,"stop":489.361,"duration":12.05},{"text":"We cannot know which it was the jury found since the prosecution did not elect between the two of the several counts of Section 11721.","start":489.361,"stop":498.24,"duration":8.88},{"text":"And so we -- we must of course challenge the -- the conviction under both grounds since -- since the -- we have no such election.","start":498.24,"stop":507.482,"duration":9.24},{"text":"So then the -- there was no evidence of the place of use except an admission on the part of the -- the appellant himself who denied

case.","start":805.496,"stop":810.282,"duration":4.79},{"text":"Now, because of the instruction of the court under addiction -- had the court not instruct yet on addiction, I would not have my basic

crime.","start":840.802,"stop":850.364,"duration":9.56},{"text":"Now, it is interesting that in only four of the States of the union as we point out from material from the alternative price annuals

ten, it is punished solely as a sickness.","start":864.298,"stop":870.793,"duration":6.5},{"text":"In the others, it is punished or it is treat, let me say or -- or treated as a sickness or punished as a crime.","start":870.793,"stop":877.168,"duration":6.38},{"text":"So the general approach is and in California surely, it maybe approached either of the crime or under the Welfare and Institutions Code, a party maybe placed in a state hospital of some kind and treated as a narcotics addict.","start":877.168,"stop":890.914,"duration":13.75},{"text":"We have no objection to such treatment in a voluntary compulsory and we feel that this is the proper approach.","start":890.914,"stop":896.628,"duration":5.71},{"text":"We feel the legislature in this law took not just a why but certainly a constitutional step.","start":896.628,"stop":901.954,"duration":5.33},{"text":"On the other hand, we have here a law which punishes out a crime the same status or condition which another law of California treats as a sickness.","start":901.954,"stop":914.494,"duration":12.54},{"text":"In the first place, I might say in passing that it seems to me that those who are treated under the
