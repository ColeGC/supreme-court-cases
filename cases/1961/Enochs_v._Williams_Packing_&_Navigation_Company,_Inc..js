years.","start":51.717,"stop":86.651,"duration":34.93},{"text":"On account of services according to the theory of the assessment, rendered by captains and crews operating shrimp boats owned or leased

books, had discussions with taxpayer's officers, and according to the record, investigated by interrogating captains and crews in the area.","start":187.58,"stop":207.458,"duration":19.88},{"text":"After having made this determination that the tax was due, the taxpayer filed a claim through the administrative review process to abate

been taken, that there has been discrimination.","start":534.596,"stop":548.544,"duration":13.95},{"text":"It's the Government's position that Congress intended that the -- that matters like this be
