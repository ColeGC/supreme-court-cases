resulted from noise, disturbances and vibrations were created by such airplanes as well as the fear for personal safety caused by the low flights in close proximity to the petitioner's residence.","start":560.436,"stop":577.012,"duration":16.58},{"text":"The said noise of planes over petitioner's property, let down to the Northeast runway have been comparable to that of a noisy
