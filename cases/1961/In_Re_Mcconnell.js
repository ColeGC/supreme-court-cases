him.","start":529.016,"stop":553.671,"duration":24.66},{"text":"And, the court said, \"We are not going to have anymore reading of these questions\" and that was on the face of the objection of

that a lawyer can do to make his record and we said that we would hear to the court's ruling.","start":627.955,"stop":638.213,"duration":10.26},{"text":"Now, there are two, or possibly three, fundamental and controlling considerations which are raised by this issue.","start":638.213,"stop":651.218,"duration":13},{"text":"In the first place, we did not pursue those offers of proof so far as Mr. Cross' participation in that conspiracy was concerned, at least not with that witness.","start":651.218,"stop":664.949,"duration":13.73},{"text":"And, the deposition showed that there have been talks where Mr. Cross had importuned him to use his influence to bring these railroads together to exclude us here.","start":664.949,"stop":677.126,"duration":12.18},{"text":"Well, we had the trial on the error of an issue, which signified nothing because there was no issue permitted to be tried.","start":677.126,"stop":685.476,"duration":8.35},{"text":"We weren't permitted to introduce any offer of conspiracy or any evidence of conspiracy or monopoly.","start":685.476,"stop":692.12,"duration":6.64},{"text":"The jury found that there was no money damages under the instructions which were given.","start":692.12,"stop":695.609,"duration":3.49},{"text":"It was practically a directed verdict, and then we came to the end of the trial and the court said, \"I'm going to write an opinion and

action.\"","start":695.609,"stop":710.446,"duration":14.84},{"text":"And then he went on and said this, \"The offers of proof upon which the plaintiff -- the proofs upon which the plaintiffs apparently were going to rely, the allegations of Cross' intervention in this situation are not supported by the offers of proof.”","start":710.446,"stop":732.418,"duration":21.97},{"text":"And, the reason I most respectfully submit to this Court that they weren't supported by the offers of proof.","start":732.418,"stop":737.478,"duration":5.06},{"text":"If they weren't, I don't think that's a correct statement, I think they were, but assuming arguendo that they were not, we couldn't make them and we couldn't make them in compliance with the rule because we were precluded.","start":737.478,"stop":753.429,"duration":15.95},{"text":"Further, when we got up in the Court of Appeals on the appeal in the Parmelee case, the Court of Appeals passed by the fact, Judge Duffy mentioned it in his dissent, the fact that we'd had no trial on any issue that was relevant to an antitrust case.","start":753.429,"stop":775.465,"duration":22.04},{"text":"And, as a make way, the court below had dismissed the complaint after another judge had held it was valid and then made his remarks about the offers of proof, but the upper court said that its analysis of the offers of proof led it to believe that this didn't constitute a valid antitrust case, even though this case had held -- this Court had held in the in the other cases, a conspiracy affecting this very branch of commerce violated the antitrust law.","start":775.465,"stop":804.798,"duration":29.33},{"text":"So, the case was dismissed.","start":804.798,"stop":808.165,"duration":3.37},{"text":"Now, the point I'm making and leading up to is counsel who has exceeded and who has met the requirements of a judge to stop, his client is utterly prejudiced in appeal.","start":808.165,"stop":830.486,"duration":22.32},{"text":"His record is not complete and will be faced with a situation which was referred to by Mr. -- the late Mr. Justice Rutledge in the Mineworkers case where he said, \"If you reach a situation where obedience means the loss of the rights -- the substantive rights, compliance means the loss of a substantive right, you're in a situation where no court should declare that criminal.”","start":830.486,"stop":862.065,"duration":31.58},{"text":"Now, we are relying here, I am relying here, upon the limitations, upon the inherent power of a court to punish for contempt which are contained in U.S. Code Section 401, Sections 1 and 3.","start":862.065,"stop":884.973,"duration":22.91},{"text":"This Court has held that, in a number of cases, that that is the congressional limitation upon the power of the Federal District Courts to punish for contempt, and they've also held -- this Court has also held that there must be shown two things.","start":884.973,"stop":902.466,"duration":17.49},{"text":"No, I regard that statement.","start":902.466,"stop":905.665,"duration":3.2},{"text":"This Court has held in the Hudgings case that there must be shown an obstruction to justice as a condition preceding to a proper exercise of the power of contempt.","start":905.665,"stop":920.351,"duration":14.69},{"text":"Section 3 of that statute provides that it must be shown that there is disobedience to a lawful order to constitute contempt punishable by a court.","start":920.351,"stop":939.259,"duration":18.91},{"text":"Now, my first position is that Judge Miner's order or direction abrogated Rule 43 (c), promulgated by this Court under the directions of the Congress, was not a lawful order and, while I didn't disobey it, still it posed a situation where I was entitled to go as far as I could go to show an unequivocal refusal by the court to let me proceed in accordance with the rule.","start":939.259,"stop":979.161,"duration":39.9},{"text":"As I say, after the recess, we told the Court we would ask no further questions regarding the incident or regarding the depositions.","start":979.161,"stop":991.103,"duration":11.94},{"text":"Now, is it a lawful order that abrogates a rule of court promulgated by the Congress -- promulgated by this Court under the authority of the Congress?","start":991.103,"stop":1003.652,"duration":12.55},{"text":"And, I find no case and the Government cites no case which holds that that is a lawful order.","start":1003.652,"stop":1011.792,"duration":8.14},{"text":"Certainly, it's a case of first impression here.","start":1011.792,"stop":1015.071,"duration":3.28},{"text":"This Court has never held that the abrogation of a rule which is reenact of Congress and which the lower courts, the courts of appeal has said is binding upon the court, is binding upon the litigant, is binding upon the lawyers.","start":1015.071,"stop":1031.748,"duration":16.68},{"text":"The abrogation of such a rule is a lawful order.","start":1031.748,"stop":1035.52,"duration":3.77},{"text":"Now, Judge Miner,
