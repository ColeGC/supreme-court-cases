requirements.”","start":1796.605,"stop":1819.176,"duration":22.57},{"text":"And we submit the question of whether there is a need on the part of the supporting shipper for the proposed service,

standard of consistency with the public interest and the National Transportation Policy that had applied since the National Transportation Policy was enacted in 1940 and had indeed applied since the motor carrier regulation was passed in 1935 because in -- until 1940, between 1935 and 1940, the standard was consistency with the public interest and Section 202 (a) of the Motor Carrier Act as it

which later as expanded became a National Transportation Policy so that this governing standard has always existed and it was not changed by the 1957 Amendments and the ability of carriers in the

that it should still be considered.","start":1892.74,"stop":1922.976,"duration":30.24},{"text":"And we don't think that it's -- of any importance that the factor of the adequacy of existing service is

certificates and contract carrier permits issued to motor carrier subsidiaries of railroads.","start":1934.669,"stop":1960.318,"duration":25.65},{"text":"And the Commission imports this standard -- these restrictions which originate in the Section 5 (2) (b) of the Act into Sections 207 and 209 dealing with motor carrier certificate and permits and that practice has been approved and indeed

Trucking Associations' case at pages 13 and 14, and we have sent them out -- set out the quote in our brief in speaking of the amended Section 209 (b), this Court clearly recognized that the ability
