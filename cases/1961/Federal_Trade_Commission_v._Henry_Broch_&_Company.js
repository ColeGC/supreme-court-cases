It could issue the order that it did issue forbidding the unlawful passing on of the brokerage in relation to sales on behalf of any seller, to any buyer or it could have made an order which said don't unlawfully pass on brokerage when you're acting as a broker for Canada Foods in selling to Smucker.","start":983.777,"stop":1016.676,"duration":32.9},{"text":"There was no, virtually no practical in between ground and the order would, in this respect, have to be one or the other.","start":1016.676,"stop":1025.726,"duration":9.05},{"text":"Now, I submit first that this order conforms very closely to what the statute tells the Commission to do.","start":1025.726,"stop":1034.257,"duration":8.53},{"text":"It says that where the Commission finds that there have been violations of the act and so issue would caused to be served on such person an order requiring such person to cease-and-desist from such violations.","start":1034.257,"stop":1050.076,"duration":15.82},{"text":"Of course, the violations weren't in any sense personal.","start":1050.076,"stop":1053.053,"duration":2.98},{"text":"There were violations regardless of the identity of Smucker, regardless of the

brokerage.”","start":1059.943,"stop":1069.124,"duration":9.18},{"text":"So that I think that it corresponds very closely to just what the statute told the Commission to do and it's very close to what
