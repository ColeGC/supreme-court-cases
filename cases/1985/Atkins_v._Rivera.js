to the Medicaid statute makes it unlawful for states to use a six month spenddown for determining Medicaid eligibility for the medically needy.","start":45.129,"stop":57.603,"duration":12.47},{"text":"The spenddown is the mechanism by which applicants who have more income than is necessary to provide their basic subsistence needs may still become eligible for Medicaid after applying their excess income to medical costs.","start":57.603,"stop":72.012,"duration":14.41},{"text":"It operates essentially like the deductible in a health insurance policy.","start":72.012,"stop":76.73,"duration":4.72},{"text":"Since 1966, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and after him the Secretary of Health and Human Services, have authorized states to use a period of six months for determining the amount of the spenddown, and most states which have chosen to extend their Medicaid coverage to the medically needy have done so on that basis.","start":76.73,"stop":96.96,"duration":20.23},{"text":"The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, however, ruled below that a 1982 amendment to the Medicaid statute requires states to use a one month spenddown.","start":96.96,"stop":108.268,"duration":11.31},{"text":"The Supreme Judicial Court based its decision upon interpretation of the federal Medicaid statute which has since been explicitly rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.","start":108.268,"stop":122.445,"duration":14.18},{"text":"The decision below is wrong because it ignores the Language and Legislative history of the 1982 amendment and the Secretary's regulation which was adopted and is maintained under an express delegation of authority which has never been amended.","start":122.445,"stop":138.12,"duration":15.68},{"text":"This case presents a pure issue of federal statutory construction, and the most important facts relate to the structure of the Medicaid program.","start":138.12,"stop":147.56,"duration":9.44},{"text":"Medicaid provides federal financial assistance to states which choose to pay for medical care for certain groups of needy individuals.","start":147.56,"stop":155.916,"duration":8.36},{"text":"States that elect to participate in the program must provide Medicaid coverage to the categorically needy, that is those individuals who are receiving cash assistance under either of the two major federal categorical welfare programs, the AFDC program for families with dependent children, or the supplemental security income program for the aged, blind, or disabled.","start":155.916,"stop":178.864,"duration":22.95},{"text":"Individuals who are receiving cash assistance under either of these programs have only enough income to meet their basic maintenance needs for food, clothing, and shelter, and have nothing left over to pay for medical care.","start":178.864,"stop":191.605,"duration":12.74},{"text":"They are automatically eligible for Medicaid without a spenddown.","start":191.605,"stop":195.391,"duration":3.79},{"text":"Participating states are not required as a general matter to provide Medicaid benefits to any other group of individuals.","start":195.391,"stop":202.913,"duration":7.52},{"text":"However, states may choose to provide benefits to one or more optional categories, the most significant of which is known as the medically needy.","start":202.913,"stop":211.836,"duration":8.92},{"text":"In order to qualify as medically needy, it is necessary first to meet the categorical requirements for either AFDC or SSI, in this case AFDC.","start":211.836,"stop":222.358,"duration":10.52},{"text":"Need for medical assistance under the medically needy program may be established in one of two ways:","start":222.358,"stop":228.428,"duration":6.07},{"text":"First, since the medically needy income standard, the means test established under the medically needy program, is often higher than the means test for AFDC, eligibility may be established on the basis of income.","start":228.428,"stop":242.57,"duration":14.14},{"text":"Alternatively, an applicant who has income in excess of the medically needy income standard may still qualify as medically needy on the basis of his or her medical costs.","start":242.57,"stop":253.31,"duration":10.74},{"text":"This process, which applies only to Medicaid applicants who have already been determined to be ineligible on the basis of their income, is known as the spenddown.","start":253.31,"stop":262.749,"duration":9.44},{"text":"For example, the first named plaintiff in this case, Ms. Rivera, had net income of about $100 a month more than the medically needy income standard for a month.","start":262.749,"stop":274.291,"duration":11.54},{"text":"Her spenddown liability, in the nature of a deductible, was six times that amount or about $600, and applied for a six month period.","start":274.291,"stop":284.348,"duration":10.06},{"text":"If she had incurred $600 of medical costs at any point during the six month period, Medicaid would have paid for any further medical costs during the period.","start":284.348,"stop":293.87,"duration":9.52},{"text":"However, Ms. Rivera incurred medical costs of only $314 and therefore Medicaid paid for none of those costs.","start":293.87,"stop":301.541,"duration":7.67},{"text":"It happened that the entire $314 was incurred during one month.","start":301.541,"stop":306.945,"duration":5.4},{"text":"Under a one-month spenddown, Ms. Rivera would have been liable only for the first $100 and Medicaid would have paid the remainder.","start":306.945,"stop":315.384,"duration":8.44},{"text":"The amount of the spenddown deductible is what is at issue in this case.","start":315.384,"stop":320.872,"duration":5.49},{"text":"Although the Secretary since 1966 has permitted states to use a six-month period to measure available excess income for this determination, the court below held that a one month period must be used.","start":320.872,"stop":334.079,"duration":13.21},{"text":"For this ruling it relied upon a 1982 amendment, part of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, TEFRA, which requires states to use the same methodology which would be employed in the applicable cash assistance programs, in this case AFDC, for determining the income and resource eligibility of the medically needy.","start":334.079,"stop":357.295,"duration":23.22},{"text":"The court below asserted that the length of the spenddown period is part of the methodology for determining income eligibility, and concluded that the amount of the spenddown must be calculated using one month's excess income, since AFDC eligibility is determined on a monthly basis.","start":357.295,"stop":376.191,"duration":18.9},{"text":"This ruling is simply incorrect.","start":376.191,"stop":379.393,"duration":3.2},{"text":"The length of the spenddown is not part of the methodology for determining income eligibility under the AFDC program.","start":379.393,"stop":386.547,"duration":7.15},{"text":"That methodology does not include taking into account medical costs at all.","start":386.547,"stop":391.534,"duration":4.99},{"text":"If Ms. Rivera had applied for AFDC, her income eligibility would have been determined without regard to her medical costs, and in fact when she applied for Medicaid as medically needy her income was determined by that same methodology and she was determined to be ineligible on the basis of her income.","start":391.534,"stop":410.929,"duration":19.39},{"text":"The spenddown is an extra step, unique to the medically needy, which is not part of the determination of income eligibility.","start":410.929,"stop":419.018,"duration":8.09},{"text":"It cannot be determined under the same methodology, because eligibility on the basis of medical costs through the spenddown is the most fundamental difference between the categorically needy and the medically needy.","start":419.018,"stop":434.278,"duration":15.26},{"text":"It is what distinguishes these two groups from each other.","start":434.278,"stop":437.849,"duration":3.57},{"text":"The scope of the same methodology which would be employed language is made very clear by a consideration of the dynamic which generated it.","start":437.849,"stop":448.054,"duration":10.2},{"text":"The term methodology had its genesis in new regulations which the Secretary issued on September 30, 1981, to implement the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, OBRA.","start":448.054,"stop":460.845,"duration":12.79},{"text":"Prior to OBRA, the Secretary had required states to use the same rules for evaluating items of income in the medically needy program as would be used in the underlying categorical program, in this case AFDC.","start":460.845,"stop":474.105,"duration":13.26},{"text":"At the same time, the Secretary since 1966 had authorized the use of a six month period for determining the spenddown, a period which was not tied to the budget period of the underlying programs.","start":474.105,"stop":488.281,"duration":14.18},{"text":"OBRA included a provision aimed at giving states greater latitude in defining the scope of their medically needy programs.","start":488.281,"stop":496.285,"duration":8},{"text":"The Secretary interpreted this provision broadly, explaining in the Federal Register that states are no longer required to apply a uniform methodology for treating income and resources.","start":496.285,"stop":508.861,"duration":12.58},{"text":"The new regulations required simply that the methodologies to be used be reasonable.","start":508.861,"stop":514.931,"duration":6.07},{"text":"The six month authorization was not changed.","start":514.931,"stop":519.567,"duration":4.64},{"text":"The TEFRA amendment was
