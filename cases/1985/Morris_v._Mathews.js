ready.","start":8.32,"stop":19.562,"duration":11.24}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:","start":19.562,"stop":22.746,"duration":3.18},{"text":"The issue in this case is, under what circumstances a jeopardy barred criminal conviction may be modified to that of a lesser and included offense which is not jeopardy barred.","start":22.746,"stop":34.637,"duration":11.89},{"text":"It is submitted that such a remedy is available, unless the defendant alleges and demonstrates that evidence otherwise inadmissible in a trial for the lesser and included offense was presented to the tryer of fact during the course of the jeopardy barred trial, and that such evidence resulted in actual prejudice to the defendant.","start":34.637,"stop":56.67,"duration":22.03},{"text":"A conviction can thus be modified, unless a defendant specifically identifies the claimed inadmissible evidence and demonstrates its prejudicial impact.","start":56.67,"stop":67.442,"duration":10.77},{"text":"Such cases are analogous to the spillover prejudice that arises in misjoinder of offense cases.","start":67.442,"stop":75.131,"duration":7.69},{"text":"Whereas here, the same evidence would have been admitted in a trial for the lesser and included offense, as what is admitted during the jeopardy barred trial, a per se rule of automatic reversal can only serve to force the defendant and the prosecution to yet a third proceeding.","start":75.131,"stop":94.01,"duration":18.88}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Drake, would all the same evidence be admissible, in your view?","start":94.01,"stop":99.814,"duration":5.8}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"In the case before the Court, all the evidence would be admissible had the Respondent in this case been indicted for murder; in other words, had the prosecution not sought the enhanced penalty, and we are talking here about an enhanced penalty case, the evidence would have been identical.","start":99.814,"stop":119.26,"duration":19.45}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"I guess your... the Respondent takes the position that not every bit of that evidence would be admissible at the new trial?","start":119.26,"stop":130.551,"duration":11.29}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"In the brief of the Respondent before this Court, he fails to identify one iota of evidence that came in, in the jeopardy barred trial, that would not have come in in the murder trial.","start":130.551,"stop":142.693,"duration":12.14},{"text":"I believe perusal of his brief demonstrates such.","start":142.693,"stop":146.744,"duration":4.05},{"text":"He does not identify one shred of testimonial or physical evidence that was presented, and it must be borne in mind that this case was not tried in a vacuum.","start":146.744,"stop":157.885,"duration":11.14},{"text":"The very motive for the homicide was to cover up the bank robbery, by the Respondent's own admission.","start":157.885,"stop":167.824,"duration":9.94},{"text":"In other words, but for the commission of the bank robbery, the homicide would never have occurred.","start":167.824,"stop":174.095,"duration":6.27},{"text":"An analysis of the facts of the instant case demonstrates the remedial action taken by the Ohio Appellate Court was wholly consistent with the double jeopardy clause and the due process clause.","start":174.095,"stop":189.57,"duration":15.47},{"text":"It's undisputed that Respondent and his accomplice robbed a federally insured bank at gunpoint.","start":189.57,"stop":195.391,"duration":5.82},{"text":"During the opening statements at the trial in question, the defense attorney informed the jury that defense did not contest the fact that the Respondent was a participant in the bank robbery.","start":195.391,"stop":208.751,"duration":13.36},{"text":"Upon exiting the bank the witness saw a vehicle and reported the license number, and a high speed chase immediately ensued.","start":208.751,"stop":217.174,"duration":8.42},{"text":"The chase ended when the Respondent and his accomplice went to a farmhouse in order to take hostages.","start":217.174,"stop":225.077,"duration":7.9},{"text":"They were unsuccessful in this endeavor.","start":225.077,"stop":227.112,"duration":2.03},{"text":"The house was completely surrounded by various law enforcement officers from a variety of jurisdictions.","start":227.112,"stop":233.349,"duration":6.24},{"text":"Two shots were heard in the home, at which time Respondent exited.","start":233.349,"stop":239.753,"duration":6.4},{"text":"The accomplice was found dead, having suffered a fatal blow to the heart at point-blank range with a sawed off single shot shotgun.","start":239.753,"stop":249.791,"duration":10.04},{"text":"Respondent was taken into custody and gave a series of statements.","start":249.791,"stop":253.845,"duration":4.05},{"text":"His initial statement to the police was made under oath and reported by a stenographer.","start":253.845,"stop":260.683,"duration":6.84},{"text":"He therein stated that he had been kidnapped by the accomplice, and that both his life and that of his girlfriend had been threatened.","start":260.683,"stop":269.105,"duration":8.42},{"text":"Therefore, he participated unwillingly.","start":269.105,"stop":272.224,"duration":3.12},{"text":"That very evening agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrived and Respondent conceded that he was in fact a willing participant in the bank robbery.","start":272.224,"stop":281.663,"duration":9.44},{"text":"He did, however, deny having shot the accomplice.","start":281.663,"stop":287.817,"duration":6.15},{"text":"The following day Respondent was taken and given a polygraph examination which he passed.","start":287.817,"stop":295.006,"duration":7.19},{"text":"He later made a statement to the police wherein he admitted he had fixed the test by crossing his toes and otherwise making efforts to fool the polygraph.","start":295.006,"stop":307.83,"duration":12.82},{"text":"Inexplicably the initial coroner's report ruled the cause of death to be suicide, a rather startling report which proved to be wholly erroneous.","start":307.83,"stop":319.705,"duration":11.88},{"text":"The coroner indicated that shots had come from a high powered rifle.","start":319.705,"stop":323.824,"duration":4.12},{"text":"It's undisputed that they came from the same saved-off shotgun.","start":323.824,"stop":329.394,"duration":5.57},{"text":"The Respondent was indicted only for the bank robbery and promptly entered a plea of guilty.","start":329.394,"stop":335.797,"duration":6.4},{"text":"Two days thereafter, while in the county jail, Respondent asked to speak with the investigating officer.","start":335.797,"stop":341.968,"duration":6.17},{"text":"That request was granted.","start":341.968,"stop":344.087,"duration":2.12},{"text":"For the first time the Respondent admitted having murdered his accomplice.","start":344.087,"stop":349.974,"duration":5.89},{"text":"A verbatim transcript of the Respondent's handwritten statement is included in the Joint Appendix at pages 5 and 6.","start":349.974,"stop":356.645,"duration":6.67},{"text":"Of material import, Respondent said, and I quote,","start":356.645,"stop":360.115,"duration":3.47},{"text":"\"I said to myself real quick that if he was dead I could say that I was kidnapped and they couldn't prove that I robbed the bank. \"","start":360.115,"stop":367.853,"duration":7.74},{"text":"Respondent later gave a tape recorded confession where he reiterated his... the reason for the homicide to cover up the bank robbery, escape culpability, and perhaps return and recover the $15,000 in stolen money which he had hidden.","start":367.853,"stop":386.23,"duration":18.38},{"text":"After his confession Respondent was indicted for what is called aggravated murder, which is that he did purposely cause the death of another and the aggravating circumstance here being that of fleeing from an aggravated or armed robbery, the distinction between simple murder, which is the highest level of homicide in Ohio, and aggravated murder is that the Ohio General Assembly has made a legislative judgment that a murder, an intentional killing committed under certain circumstances, here while fleeing a bank robbery, warrant enhanced punishment.","start":386.23,"stop":425.891,"duration":39.66},{"text":"While the aggravating factor here, the bank robbery, is an element of the crime it is not a lesser included offense, and the trial judge would err were he to instruct you on the bank robbery itself.","start":425.891,"stop":438.132,"duration":12.24}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Drake, why would the State allow the entry of the guilty plea to robbery when it knew that there was a murder charge that should have been made?","start":438.132,"stop":451.173,"duration":13.04}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"Your Honor, at the time they did not know that.","start":451.173,"stop":453.324,"duration":2.15},{"text":"They were confronted with a coroner's report which was wholly erroneous, which ruled the cause of death suicide, and they also were confronted with the fact that he had taken and passed a polygraph examination, Your Honor.","start":453.324,"stop":466.384,"duration":13.06}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I thought that the correct information had been made available before the entry of the guilty plea.","start":466.384,"stop":473.955,"duration":7.57}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"The forensic pathologist from Cincinnatti, Ohio, had forwarded his findings to the prosecutor, that's correct.","start":473.955,"stop":482.144,"duration":8.19},{"text":"They were aware that the coroner's factual assessment was incorrect.","start":482.144,"stop":488.732,"duration":6.59},{"text":"They were not, obviously, aware that his conclusions vis-a-vis suicide is incorrect.","start":488.732,"stop":494.635,"duration":5.9},{"text":"The conclusion stood, and they were also faced with someone who, a day after the commission of the act, had passed this polygraph test, albeit he had fooled the operator and later conceded such.","start":494.635,"stop":506.009,"duration":11.37},{"text":"As a matter of fact, he later took a stipulated polygraph examination and failed it quite miserably when he was not allowed to cheat.","start":506.009,"stop":515.615,"duration":9.61}]},{"speakerName":"William J. Brennan, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Drake, he was prosecuted for aggravated murder, was he not?","start":515.615,"stop":520.019,"duration":4.4}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"Correct, Your Honor.","start":520.019,"stop":520.586,"duration":0.57}]},{"speakerName":"William J. Brennan, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"And did the State concede in the federal court, not just state court, that the trial for aggravated murder violated double jeopardy?","start":520.586,"stop":530.542,"duration":9.96}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, that was a concession that was made.","start":530.542,"stop":532.61,"duration":2.07},{"text":"For purposes of this argument, that concession is made, although in light of--","start":532.61,"stop":536.645,"duration":4.03}]},{"speakerName":"William J.

Brennan, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"So, there's still the issue of the modification of the sentence?","start":552.488,"stop":557.059,"duration":4.57}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"The case before this Court is one of remedy, at this juncture.","start":557.059,"stop":560.111,"duration":3.05}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"May I go back, since you have been interrupted, to Justice O'Connor's question earlier about whether the same evidence would have been admissible in the trial for the lesser offense than was actually received.","start":560.111,"stop":572.984,"duration":12.87},{"text":"After our remand in the light of Vitale, the Ohio Court of Appeals reduced the charge, as I understand, reduced the sentence.","start":572.984,"stop":582.507,"duration":9.52},{"text":"Did they base that on just an automatic rule that that took care of the double jeopardy problem, or did they also decide that the evidence would have been the same anyway?","start":582.507,"stop":590.113,"duration":7.61},{"text":"Or, they didn't reach that, as I remember.","start":590.113,"stop":591.696,"duration":1.58}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":591.696,"stop":592.046,"duration":0.35},{"text":"Upon remand from this Court, it was never... the spillover prejudice argument was presented for the first time in the Federal Circuit Court.","start":592.046,"stop":600.636,"duration":8.59},{"text":"It wasn't even presented to the District Court, Your Honor.","start":600.636,"stop":602.838,"duration":2.2},{"text":"I rather vehemently objected to bringing it up at that juncture, but as the Court below indicates in a footnote they found my arguments to be--","start":602.838,"stop":611.309,"duration":8.47}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"At the time of the remand in light of Vitale, was there another argument before the Ohio Appellate Court or did the Court just take the case and then issue its judgment?","start":611.309,"stop":620.965,"duration":9.66}]},{"speakerName":"Richard

Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"One of the things that's worrying me about the case, if the issue should be controlling, and I'm not saying it should but as Justice O'Connor raised the question, I'm just wondering, where in the first instance should the decision be made as to whether there would have been some admissibility problem in another case?","start":625.786,"stop":641.296,"duration":15.51},{"text":"I hate to get into that myself as a federal judge.","start":641.296,"stop":643.831,"duration":2.53},{"text":"I just wonder what your views should be on how that should be done.","start":643.831,"stop":647.217,"duration":3.39}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"Most assuredly, had the issue been raised the Ohio Appellate Court would have been forced to make that assessment.","start":647.217,"stop":652.853,"duration":5.64},{"text":"As I indicated, it was not raised before the Ohio Appellate Court.","start":652.853,"stop":656.405,"duration":3.55}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"But you're also not sure they had a chance to raise it, as I understand, because there may not have been briefing at that time?","start":656.405,"stop":660.792,"duration":4.39}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"I really do not know, Your Honor, correct.","start":660.792,"stop":663.009,"duration":2.22},{"text":"I do know that the issue wasn't... they certainly had the chance to raise it in the Supreme Court of Ohio and did

Circuit.","start":670.148,"stop":678.171,"duration":8.02},{"text":"Had they raised it, they certainly abandoned it rather expeditiously.","start":678.171,"stop":687.776,"duration":9.6},{"text":"As I indicated, it is briefed before this Court, the Respondent does not articulate so much as one piece of evidence that was admitted in the enhancement homicide trial that would not have been admitted in a trial for so-called simple murder.","start":687.776,"stop":707.488,"duration":19.71},{"text":"In such circumstances, to mandate that both the prosecution and the defense suffer yet a third proceeding is not only not commensurate with the double jeopardy values, but actually frustrates the very value of finality.","start":707.488,"stop":726.652,"duration":19.16},{"text":"The prohibition against the second prosecution, subsequent to an earlier... for the same offense, subsequent to an earlier conviction, is grounded upon an analysis that you want to prevent both prosecutorial overreaching, bad faith, there is no allegation of that here, and you want to promote finality.","start":726.652,"stop":747.398,"duration":20.75},{"text":"Any precept of finality has been totally undermined in this case.","start":747.398,"stop":751.6,"duration":4.2},{"text":"The remedy is clearly commensurate... the remedy of the Ohio Appellate Court is clearly commensurate with perceived violation.","start":751.6,"stop":758.706,"duration":7.11},{"text":"What the Respondent wants this Court to do is apply a due process analysis which is akin, identical if you will, to the analysis used in misjoinder of offense cases where we're talking about a state court conviction, the accused defendant, the convicted defendant, must demonstrate actual prejudice.","start":758.706,"stop":778.334,"duration":19.63}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Drake, we're dealing with a constitutional

violations.","start":792.844,"stop":796.831,"duration":3.99},{"text":"For instance, were this a violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment, surely the conviction would not be reversed but the sentence reduced.","start":796.831,"stop":806.037,"duration":9.21},{"text":"Were this a Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance of counsel case, there is a rule of automatic or per se reversal on such a demonstration.","start":806.037,"stop":814.542,"duration":8.5},{"text":"In this instance the supposed violation of the double jeopardy clause was remedied when the defendant was placed in the position that he should have been.","start":814.542,"stop":827.1,"duration":12.56},{"text":"The proceeding itself should not have occurred.","start":827.1,"stop":829.652,"duration":2.55},{"text":"I would note that Respondent here did not endeavor to take an interlocutory appeal once the trial judge overruled his motion to quash the indictment, which could have in theory at least prevented this entire difficulty.","start":829.652,"stop":843.646,"duration":13.99}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day

Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"No.","start":848.431,"stop":848.998,"duration":0.57},{"text":"The standard that is... as we suggest, and I believe is the appropriate standard, is that used for misjoinder of offenses which is that the accused, the Respondent here, must articulate with specificity those items of evidence that were admitted that were otherwise inadmissible, and must demonstrate actual prejudice as a result of that admission.","start":848.998,"stop":871.313,"duration":22.31}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"You think the burden of proof is on the defendant?","start":871.313,"stop":874.498,"duration":3.19}]},{"speakerName":"Richard David Drake","textObjs":[{"text":"That's correct, because we're essentially talking about a due process rather than a double jeopardy analysis.","start":874.498,"stop":879.466,"duration":4.97},{"text":"The double jeopardy clause that he... what the Respondent endeavors to do here is to garner relief from the double jeopardy clause when he's already been afforded that relief.","start":879.466,"stop":891.691,"duration":12.23},{"text":"He can take that extra step.","start":891.691,"stop":893.543,"duration":1.85},{"text":"If he can demonstrate that evidence was admitted, and that evidence resulted in actual prejudice to himself, then the conviction must be vacated and he must be afforded a new trial.","start":893.543,"stop":905.533,"duration":11.99},{"text":"This case is very much akin to the resolution that this Court made in Benton versus Maryland.","start":905.533,"stop":910.754,"duration":5.22},{"text":"Unfortunately... fortunately that case came upon direct review and the conviction which was alleged to have been tainted as a result

approach.","start":910.754,"stop":930.835,"duration":20.08},{"text":"Here, what the Petitioner wants to do... this is unlike a typical constitutional violation, a Griffin violation, search and seizure violation, where the violation of the Constitution itself is concrete, identifiable, and is the issue before the Court.","start":930.835,"stop":948.296,"duration":17.46},{"text":"What the Respondent wants to do is take an entire trial that might span weeks and look to mere, simple state evidentiary principles, materiality, hearsay, et cetera and ask the federal judiciary to get involved in an ad
