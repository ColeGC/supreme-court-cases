area.","start":137.555,"stop":154.148,"duration":16.59},{"text":"Indeed, in light of the Tort Claims Act, Respondents have the burden of showing that the liability for which they seek to recover was unambiguously not covered by the provision, because even if the provision was ambiguous, then the Tort Claims Act waiver could not be unambiguous.","start":154.148,"stop":174.644,"duration":20.5},{"text":"So we think in a way they have quite a difficult burden to

favor of the government, however, holding that Section 702(c) barred Respondents' tort actions because Respondents' injuries were caused by flood waters.","start":241.805,"stop":254.53,"duration":12.72},{"text":"The second incident at issue here occurred at the Courtableau Drainage Structure, a flood control project located near Opelousas, Louisiana.","start":254.53,"stop":263.636,"duration":9.11},{"text":"On May 17, 1980, the Bayou Courtableau was at flood level, and the drainage structure's gates were opened so that the bayou would

died.","start":283.882,"stop":287.417,"duration":3.53},{"text":"The District Court in that case granted the government's motion for summary judgment, holding that Respondent Clardy's tort claim was barred by Section 702(c).","start":287.417,"stop":296.273,"duration":8.86},{"text":"The Court found that Section 702(c) applied because the drainage structures' gates had been opened to prevent flooding, and the diverted waters were flood waters within the meaning of that provision.","start":296.273,"stop":306.712,"duration":10.44},{"text":"The cases were consolidated on appeal, and the panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.","start":306.712,"stop":312.366,"duration":5.65},{"text":"The panel stated that prior Fifth Circuit decisions bound it to hold that Section 702(c) barred

provision.","start":340.166,"stop":357.562,"duration":17.4},{"text":"We submit that the Court of Appeals unprecedented construction of Section 702(c) is incorrect for two separate reasons.","start":357.562,"stop":364.75,"duration":7.19},{"text":"First, the plain language of the statute and the statute's legislative history permit only one conclusion, that Section 702(c)
