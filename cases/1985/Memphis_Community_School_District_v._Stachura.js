Plaintiff was involved at the time of the deprivation.","start":246.76,"stop":271.291,"duration":24.53},{"text":"Sequentially, and because the jury has already been admonished not to award punitive

all.","start":271.291,"stop":305.399,"duration":34.11},{"text":"I think in that way, by viewing the instructions as a whole and looking at the sequence, it can be seen that the instruction is

right.","start":372.693,"stop":380.799,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The instruction to the jury itself indicated that damages for the intrinsic value of those rights are very difficult to measure, but,

substantive deprivation.","start":421.09,"stop":441.937,"duration":20.85},{"text":"We would urge the Court to consider that it would have made no difference that procedural and substantive deprivations were segregated for purposes of determining if the award was proper.","start":441.937,"stop":454.763,"duration":12.83},{"text":"The real distinction is whether intrinsic value damages

instruction.","start":467.654,"stop":473.641,"duration":5.99},{"text":"First, the intrinsic value instruction conflicts with the availability of nominal
