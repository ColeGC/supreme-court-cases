Court, if it please the Court, ladies and gentlemen of the audience, it is an honor to appear before the Court.","start":14.97,"stop":23.615,"duration":8.64},{"text":"I understand from the clerk that

case.","start":45.331,"stop":50.025,"duration":4.69},{"text":"However, I didn't, and I think that given the case law involved in this Court and the circuits that it wasn't necessary, and I would like to proceed with the argument.","start":50.025,"stop":61.172,"duration":11.15},{"text":"A little history of the case.","start":61.172,"stop":63.261,"duration":2.09},{"text":"My client was charged with murder in Cuyahoga County in Cleveland, where she was convicted.","start":63.261,"stop":69.276,"duration":6.01},{"text":"On appeal, Judge Krensler, who is now a Federal District Court Judge in Cleveland, held that from the current psychological and sociological research has emerged a profile of a battered woman as one who displays unique behavioral patterns and psychological characteristics as well as differences in reaction and perception, all of which are not within the knowledge of the average juror.","start":69.276,"stop":92.521,"duration":23.25},{"text":"He concluded that without expert testimony on the battered woman syndrome, a jury would be unable to have a sufficient comprehension of the defendant's state of mind at the time of the homicide.","start":92.521,"stop":104.559,"duration":12.04},{"text":"The Ohio Supreme Court granted review of the case and reversed the reversal.","start":104.559,"stop":110.053,"duration":5.49},{"text":"I then went to the Federal District Court Judge in Cleveland.","start":110.053,"stop":113.294,"duration":3.24},{"text":"It was referred to a magistrate, who recommended that the petition for habeas corpus be denied.","start":113.294,"stop":119.299,"duration":6.01},{"text":"The District Court Judge had a de novo determination.","start":119.299,"stop":123.413,"duration":4.11},{"text":"Notwithstanding the failure to file objections, the Sixth Circuit, implementing what is now known as the Walters policy, held that by failing to object to the magistrate's report, one waives the right to appeal to the circuit from the District Court order.","start":123.413,"stop":142.454,"duration":19.04},{"text":"I then petitioned for cert and this Court granted it.","start":142.454,"stop":145.606,"duration":3.15},{"text":"There are basically four points I would like to make on argument today.","start":145.606,"stop":148.888,"duration":3.28},{"text":"The first and most important one is the interplay between the magistrate's act and Article 3 of the United States constitution.","start":148.888,"stop":156.953,"duration":8.06},{"text":"When our forefathers were setting up the new government after the Revolutionary War, they were very wary of putting all the governmental power, basically the legislative, executive, and judiciary, into the same hands.","start":156.953,"stop":171.652,"duration":14.7},{"text":"Accordingly, they felt that it was necessary that there be an independent judiciary.","start":171.652,"stop":175.526,"duration":3.87},{"text":"They wrote Article 3.","start":175.526,"stop":177.697,"duration":2.17},{"text":"Article 3 basically says that there shall be a Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress may establish.","start":177.697,"stop":184.801,"duration":7.1},{"text":"It also said that those courts were to be staffed by judges who have life tenure and a set salary.","start":184.801,"stop":191.817,"duration":7.02},{"text":"I must admit that Article 3 at first blush seems a relatively simple statement of fact.","start":191.817,"stop":198.8,"duration":6.98},{"text":"It spawned a great deal of litigation in this Court.","start":198.8,"stop":201.853,"duration":3.05},{"text":"I do not pretend to understand Article 3 and the litigation it has spawned, particularly in such cases as Northern Pipeline.","start":201.853,"stop":208.647,"duration":6.79},{"text":"However, with regard to the interplay between Article 3 and the Magistrates Act, this Court has quite clearly stated what the law is.","start":208.647,"stop":217.164,"duration":8.52},{"text":"Now, the Magistrates Act was provided in Congress in 1976 and subsequently amended basically to set up a series of inferior judicial officers, inferior, that is, to the District Courts, to help the District Courts with the overwhelming case law that they were being presented with.","start":217.164,"stop":236.665,"duration":19.5},{"text":"Basically, they may consider nondispositive pretrial matters, conduct evidentiary hearings of dispositive motions, habeas corpus, et cetera.","start":236.665,"stop":246.131,"duration":9.47},{"text":"In the section that we are dealing with here, that is, 28 USC 636(b)(1)(B), they can conduct hearings on a habeas corpus and then provide the judge with proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition by the Judge.","start":246.131,"stop":263.153,"duration":17.02},{"text":"Parties may file objections, and the Judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report objected to.","start":263.153,"stop":270.067,"duration":6.91},{"text":"However, the last sentence, I think, is the key.","start":270.067,"stop":272.138,"duration":2.07},{"text":"The Court may accept, reject, or modify the report.","start":272.138,"stop":276.542,"duration":4.4},{"text":"This Court in several cases has considered the interplay between Article 3 and the Magistrates Act, most often through the pen of Chief Justice Burger.","start":276.542,"stop":289.6,"duration":13.06},{"text":"The basic cases are the United States versus Raddatz and Mathews versus Weber.","start":289.6,"stop":294.344,"duration":4.74},{"text":"This Court quite clearly has said the Magistrates Act is constitutional because the ultimate decisionmaking rests with the United States District Court.","start":294.344,"stop":305.72,"duration":11.38},{"text":"Those cases basically came up with three points.","start":305.72,"stop":307.893,"duration":2.17},{"text":"One, in going over the legislative history of the Magistrates Act, this Court has said Congress was sensitive to the Article 3 considerations.","start":307.893,"stop":318.32,"duration":10.43},{"text":"They were sensitive to not putting in a magistrate Article 3 duties.","start":318.32,"stop":323.503,"duration":5.18},{"text":"Hence this Court stressed and Congress stressed that the ultimate adjudicatory determination was reserved to the District Court.","start":323.503,"stop":331.969,"duration":8.47},{"text":"The second point this Court has made in Raddatz and Mathews is, the Court says that the ultimate authority and responsibility to make an informed formal determination must remain with the Judge.","start":331.969,"stop":345.006,"duration":13.04},{"text":"Three, the Court stressed the magistrate's role is one of helping the Court to narrow the dispute, focusing on the legal issues.","start":345.006,"stop":353.512,"duration":8.51},{"text":"However, it again stressed the Court alone remains the ultimate decisionmaker.","start":353.512,"stop":359.097,"duration":5.58},{"text":"In sum, this Court said in Raddatz and Weber, the delegation of the magistrate to hear issues does not violate Article 3 so long as the ultimate decision is made by the District Court.","start":359.097,"stop":370.902,"duration":11.81}]},{"speakerName":"Lewis F.
