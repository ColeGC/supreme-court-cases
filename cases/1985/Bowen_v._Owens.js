brief, divorced spouses were still being treated differently for other purposes; that is, with regard to what are called spouses' benefits which are benefits that a divorced spouse might receive when the wage earner is still alive, the remarriage rule continued, even after 1977.","start":605.476,"stop":637.364,"duration":31.89},{"text":"So that, in essence, Congress in 1977 was treating divorced spouses more alike and widowed spouses more alike.","start":637.364,"stop":654.576,"duration":17.21},{"text":"Before discussing these points in a little bit more detail and going over two more of the rational bases on which Congress acted, I'd like to say a word about the legal standard to be applied in judging the constitutionality of Congress's actions here.","start":654.576,"stop":672.538,"duration":17.96},{"text":"It seems clear that the standard should be the rational basis test, and district court in this case in fact applied the rational basis test.","start":672.538,"stop":682.576,"duration":10.04},{"text":"In the context of the Social Security Act, this Court has measured classifications based on divorce, in Matthews versus De Castro, and based on remarriage in Califano versus Jobst, according to a rational basis test, and there's no reason to do otherwise here.","start":682.576,"stop":702.407,"duration":19.83},{"text":"The test, then, is simply whether Congress's action can be said to manifest a patently arbitrary classification utterly lacking in rational justification, and I think the district court's error in applying this test is fairly easy to pinpoint, and it goes to the rationale that we have been discussing previously, rationale of differences in dependency between divorced spouses and widowed spouses.","start":702.407,"stop":732.176,"duration":29.77},{"text":"The district court seemed to believe that when Congress gave survivors' benefits to divorced spouses, it committed itself to the position that there was no basis whatsoever for distinguishing between divorced spouses and widowed spouses.","start":732.176,"stop":748.586,"duration":16.41},{"text":"But what the district court failed to recognize is what I've stated previously, that Congress has always treated, even in 1977, has treated divorced and widowed spouses differently, and the fact that Congress chose to treat them the same for purposes of initial eligibility for survivors' benefits does not mean that Congress was requiring them to treat them the same for all purposes.","start":748.586,"stop":777.038,"duration":28.45},{"text":"It was rational for Congress to give effect to he differences between the two groups at the time of remarriage.","start":777.038,"stop":785.061,"duration":8.02},{"text":"I've discussed previously in answer to questions the chronology of Congress's first giving no benefits to divorced spouses, thereby recognizing the reality of the legal severance of relationship at the time of divorce, and then giving benefits to divorced spouses but using two criteria of dependency, 20-year duration marriage requirement plus some more specific criteria, and Congress then being concerned that the more specific criteria were not working well and retaining only the 20-year marriage requirement and then reducing the 20-year marriage requirement to a ten-year marriage requirement but still retaining that as a criteria of dependency.","start":785.061,"stop":842.147,"duration":57.09},{"text":"But all of this suggests that the differences between divorced spouses and widowed spouses have been at least as apparent to Congress as their similarities.","start":842.147,"stop":853.521,"duration":11.37},{"text":"Thus, when Congress considered changing the rule that ended survivors' benefits on remarriage, and when Congress chose as it did to proceed a step at a time with regard to the elimination of this remarriage rule, Congress acted quite reasonably in eliminating the remarriage rule, first for the one category of beneficiaries for whom there had never been a dependency test, and that was widows and widowers.","start":853.521,"stop":882.89,"duration":29.37},{"text":"Congress at the same time then continued, in effect, the remarriage rule for all other categories of beneficiaries, those categories being categories where there were dependency tests attached which was, as I've stated, not only the surviving divorced spouses but also dependent parents for whom there was a dependency test, and dependent children for whom there is a dependency test.","start":882.89,"stop":909.108,"duration":26.22},{"text":"Put another way, Congress could rationally assume that its concerns that had been manifested in prior legislation about divorced spouses who had not worked during the years when they were married, could be set aside on the event of the remarriage of the divorced spouse.","start":909.108,"stop":930.271,"duration":21.16},{"text":"I would like to briefly mention two other things that can be said about the rationality of the distinction that Congress chose here in 1977.","start":930.271,"stop":940.477,"duration":10.21},{"text":"First of all, as I have alluded to very briefly earlier, when a divorced spouse receives survivors' benefits there is a possibility that another spouse may also be receiving benefits based on the one wage earner's account.","start":940.477,"stop":955.204,"duration":14.73},{"text":"Benefits to divorced spouses are not counted against the ceiling amount that may be paid based on one single wage earner's account.","start":955.204,"stop":964.278,"duration":9.07},{"text":"Thus, Congress's decision to pay benefits to divorced spouses creates the potential for... and I don't mean this pejoratively but just descriptively... as sort of a double dipping based on the one wage earner's account, and this is a special kind of drain on the trust fund.","start":964.278,"stop":981.221,"duration":16.94}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Is that possible in the other situation where the widow's benefit... could the
