There is only one first appearance through counsel in any case.","start":340.488,"stop":346.765,"duration":6.28},{"text":"In this case, that first appearance was on February 18 when Respondent was arraigned on the original indictment.","start":346.765,"stop":352.841,"duration":6.08},{"text":"His trial did not begin until 59 days later, and therefore he clearly was given 30 days within which to

term (c)(2) by Congress manifests Congress' intent to guarantee only a single preparation period of 30 days.","start":365.446,"stop":375.629,"duration":10.18},{"text":"There is nothing in the statute

returned.","start":375.629,"stop":389.656,"duration":14.03},{"text":"In fact, whenever Congress did want to give a defendant a second preparation period, to guarantee a defendant a second 30 day

again.","start":402.556,"stop":417.393,"duration":14.84},{"text":"In contrast, the act is structured so that where a superseding indictment is returned and the original indictment is dismissed on the government's motion, the time limits are calculated with reference to the original indictment.","start":417.393,"stop":429.702,"duration":12.31},{"text":"Congress, of course, recognized that 30 days would not always be sufficient time for a defendant to prepare.","start":429.702,"stop":435.496,"duration":5.79},{"text":"Therefore, in the Speedy Trial Act there is a second provision that protects a defendant from being rushed to trial before he is ready.","start":435.496,"stop":442.321,"duration":6.83},{"text":"That second provision is the ends of justice continuance provision.","start":442.321,"stop":447.662,"duration":5.34},{"text":"It stops the speedy trial clock, it allows a judge to stop the clock by granting a continuance of whatever length is necessary to accommodate the needs of a defendant.","start":447.662,"stop":458.455,"duration":10.79},{"text":"The length of the continuance can be one, as little as one day, and it can be as long as 40 days or 50 days or longer.","start":458.455,"stop":467.217,"duration":8.76},{"text":"It is our position that it is this ends of justice continuance provision section of the statute that applies where a superseding indictment is returned, but that is the section that protects a defendant from being rushed on trial before he is ready in light of any changes that have been made in the superseding indictment.","start":467.217,"stop":488.52,"duration":21.3},{"text":"The decision of the Court of Appeals also conflicts with the legislative history of the Speedy Trial Act.","start":488.52,"stop":496.066,"duration":7.55},{"text":"The theme that pervades the legislative history both in 1974 when the statute was originally enacted, and again in 1979 when it was amended, was the desire of Congress to accelerate criminal trials.","start":496.066,"stop":509.997,"duration":13.93},{"text":"Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to protect the public's right to speedy justice.","start":509.997,"stop":516.12,"duration":6.12},{"text":"As originally enacted, the statute contained only maximum time limits.","start":516.12,"stop":521.914,"duration":5.79},{"text":"There was no mandatory minimum preparation period for defendants.","start":521.914,"stop":525.726,"duration":3.81},{"text":"In 1979 Congress considered amendments to the Act.","start":525.726,"stop":530.348,"duration":4.62},{"text":"It was urged by both the Department of Justice and the defense bar to extend the maximum time limits of the Act, but Congress held fast in its view that the minimum 30 day period... that the 70 day maximum time limit should be retained, that the public's right to a speedy trial had to be protected.","start":530.348,"stop":550.06,"duration":19.71},{"text":"Instead, to ensure that a defendant was not rushed to trial before he was ready, Congress amended the act in two respects.","start":550.06,"stop":558.573,"duration":8.51},{"text":"First, it included (c)(2), the mandatory 30 day preparation period which in our view applies only once in a criminal case.","start":558.573,"stop":565.648,"duration":7.08},{"text":"It also amended the ends of justice continuance provision to state specifically that a continuance could be granted to accommodate the needs of defense counsel where additional preparation time was needed.","start":565.648,"stop":578.362,"duration":12.71},{"text":"Both of these amendments were derived from guidelines that had been published earlier that year by the Second Circuit.","start":578.362,"stop":585.936,"duration":7.57},{"text":"Significantly, the Second Circuit guidelines did not think it was necessary to guarantee a defendant a 30 day preparation period after a superseding indictment was returned.","start":585.936,"stop":595.573,"duration":9.64},{"text":"The guidelines acknowledged that not all superseding
