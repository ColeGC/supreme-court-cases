exists.","start":506.67,"stop":512.574,"duration":5.9},{"text":"Both of these decisions put the question into the judicial proceeding, in two ways.","start":512.574,"stop":518.31,"duration":5.74},{"text":"The first way is by putting that actual determination of probable cause into the judicial proceeding, asking a neutral and detached body

detached body that the prosecuting attorney is seeking review from.","start":518.31,"stop":542.526,"duration":24.22},{"text":"The second way that it's brought into the criminal proceedings is that if

protections inherent in those criminal proceedings.","start":542.526,"stop":561.987,"duration":19.46},{"text":"Therefore, we believe that this function of the police officer and the function of the prosecuting attorney are so similar that the immunity granted to a prosecuting attorney for the function that he performs should also be applied to the police officer in this situation.","start":561.987,"stop":579.716,"duration":17.73},{"text":"We believe that the Court's policy reasons for applying immunity also apply in this case.","start":579.716,"stop":588.386,"duration":8.67},{"text":"In deciding whether or not to apply immunity, the Court has considered several policy factors, and we believe those policy factors can be summarized in three areas.","start":588.386,"stop":601.896,"duration":13.51},{"text":"One area, the first area, is whether or not the action occurred within judicial proceedings.","start":601.896,"stop":609.235,"duration":7.34},{"text":"The second is whether or not the action taken is likely to result in retaliatory lawsuits.","start":609.235,"stop":614.503,"duration":5.27},{"text":"And the third is whether or not there are sufficient safeguards to establish the accountability of the official.","start":614.503,"stop":621.043,"duration":6.54},{"text":"The Court's policy concerns first center around whether or not the action occurs within the judicial proceedings.","start":621.043,"stop":628.963,"duration":7.92},{"text":"In every case when the Court has granted any kind of absolute immunity, it has always been within the judicial process, except of course for that instance in which the President of the United States was granted immunity because of his very special and unique function in our system of government.","start":628.963,"stop":643.489,"duration":14.53},{"text":"But in every other case, absolute immunity has been granted because of an action that has occurred within the judicial process.","start":643.489,"stop":650.476,"duration":6.99},{"text":"The Court has stated that it is very concerned to make sure that the integrity of the judicial process is insulated from lawsuit,
