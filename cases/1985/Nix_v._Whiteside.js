Washington provides guidance for analyzing the facts in this case, and that: first, the facts reveal no error of counsel that is outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance; and second, even if there were such errors, actual prejudice in the sense of substantial likelihood that the jury verdict would have been affected is not present here.","start":128.09,"stop":155.391,"duration":27.3},{"text":"Let's take our voyage through the facts.","start":155.391,"stop":158.327,"duration":2.94},{"text":"Whiteside and two companions in the early morning hours approached Calvin Love's small apartment, where he was sleeping with his girlfriend.","start":158.327,"stop":167.683,"duration":9.36},{"text":"They obtained entry to the apartment and a heated argument occurred over drugs.","start":167.683,"stop":173.353,"duration":5.67},{"text":"Love arose from his bed and was stabbed by Calvin... by the defendant here, Whiteside As a result of the stabbing, Whiteside fled, disposed of the knife.","start":173.353,"stop":183.847,"duration":10.49},{"text":"But before he could make arrangements to flee to Michigan, he was arrested by police.","start":183.847,"stop":190.33,"duration":6.48},{"text":"Calvin Whiteside died shortly thereafter at the Cedar Rapids Hospital.","start":190.33,"stop":194.922,"duration":4.59},{"text":"Whiteside's conflict with the judicial system began almost immediately.","start":194.922,"stop":199.779,"duration":4.86},{"text":"His first appointed attorneys were former prosecutors and, after several session meeting with his attorneys, the attorneys approached the state trial court and moved to withdraw and Whiteside testified he just didn't want these attorneys.","start":199.779,"stop":213.523,"duration":13.74},{"text":"When asked why, he said: Well, they're former prosecutors; I don't feel comfortable with them.","start":213.523,"stop":218.786,"duration":5.26},{"text":"At that time he then insisted on the appointment of an attorney by the name of Thomas Cailor.","start":218.786,"stop":224.113,"duration":5.33},{"text":"The state trial court would not allow that appointment because Cailor's law partner was already representing one of the companions of Whiteside who was present at the scene of the crime, thereby raising a potential issue of multiple representation.","start":224.113,"stop":238.311,"duration":14.2},{"text":"Nonetheless, statute insisted he wanted Cailor to represent him.","start":238.311,"stop":242.824,"duration":4.51},{"text":"Finally, Gary Robinson was appointed by the court to represent Whiteside.","start":242.824,"stop":249.43,"duration":6.61},{"text":"What this fact shows... what this series of facts show is that Whiteside knew how to complain about attorneys and was not shy about expressing those views to the court.","start":249.43,"stop":257.708,"duration":8.28},{"text":"Robinson immediately began a zealous defense of Whiteside on the charges of murder.","start":257.708,"stop":264.69,"duration":6.98},{"text":"In the 69 days before trial, he met with his client 23 times or more, and I think the record demonstrates the very effective character of Robinson's representation.","start":264.69,"stop":275.639,"duration":10.95},{"text":"At the beginning of his representation, he met with Whiteside in his jail cell and was presented with a written piece of paper that purported to describe the character of transactions that led to White's death.","start":275.639,"stop":288.54,"duration":12.9},{"text":"And in that written statement the following words appear:","start":288.54,"stop":291.587,"duration":3.05},{"text":"\"He was pulling a pistol from underneath the pillow in bed just prior to the stabbing. \"","start":291.587,"stop":297.35,"duration":5.76},{"text":"And his attorney asked, did you see the gun?","start":297.35,"stop":301.457,"duration":4.11},{"text":"Did you actually see the gun?","start":301.457,"stop":303.098,"duration":1.64},{"text":"And the answer was no, but I thought for sure he had a gun.","start":303.098,"stop":305.643,"duration":2.54},{"text":"It was also revealed that Whiteside had some assistance in preparing the statement.","start":305.643,"stop":310.844,"duration":5.2},{"text":"Consistently throughout the representation, then, Whiteside said that he did not see a gun, but thought that the deceased did have a gun.","start":310.844,"stop":321.06,"duration":10.22},{"text":"He though this because Calvin Love had a reputation for being armed.","start":321.06,"stop":324.761,"duration":3.7},{"text":"He thought that because the night of th homicide he instructed his girlfriend, in the heat of the argument, to get his piece, which is slang of course for a weapon.","start":324.761,"stop":334.21,"duration":9.45},{"text":"Robinson conducted an independent investigation to determine if a weapon actually existed.","start":334.21,"stop":339.567,"duration":5.36},{"text":"He talked to the three eyewitnesses who were on the scene of the crime, and they did not see a weapon.","start":339.567,"stop":344.581,"duration":5.01},{"text":"And there were two police searches, really, of the small apartment.","start":344.581,"stop":348.064,"duration":3.48},{"text":"The first was what has been characterized as a cursory search, and no doubt it was, several minutes after police arrived on the scene, and they did not find a gun.","start":348.064,"stop":357.701,"duration":9.64},{"text":"The apartment was then padlocked and about an hour later the police ID team arrived and searched for a weapon and did not find a gun.","start":357.701,"stop":364.9,"duration":7.2},{"text":"With that, Robinson was convinced that indeed there was no gun, but that the best defense would be that the defendant reasonably thought that Calvin Love while he was in his bed was armed, and that's how the defense proceeded.","start":364.9,"stop":378.13,"duration":13.23},{"text":"But about a week before trial, the defendant, in his own words, \"got nervous\" about his upcoming defense, and in a question and answer period with his attorney he stated that he saw something metallic in Love's hands.","start":378.13,"stop":393.905,"duration":15.77},{"text":"And with that, the two lawyers who were present, Robinson and an associate, Donna Paulson, stopped him and said, where did this metallic item come from?","start":393.905,"stop":403.355,"duration":9.45},{"text":"You haven't told us anything about that before.","start":403.355,"stop":406.118,"duration":2.76},{"text":"And, in Whiteside's words... and these are important:","start":406.118,"stop":408.694,"duration":2.58},{"text":"\"In Howard Cooke's case there was a gun. \"","start":408.694,"stop":411.991,"duration":3.3},{"text":"\"If I don't say I saw a gun, I'm dead. \"","start":411.991,"stop":416.145,"duration":4.15},{"text":"With that, his lawyers were shocked and they issued anti-perjury admonitions.","start":416.145,"stop":421.175,"duration":5.03},{"text":"Specifically, the admonitions were: number one, it's not necessary to say that you actually saw a gun to have a defense here; you could present the argument you reasonably believed a gun was present.","start":421.175,"stop":431.529,"duration":10.35},{"text":"The lawyers said they would not allow perjury in the courts of Iowa and that they would seek to withdraw if he insisted upon presenting perjured testimony.","start":431.529,"stop":439.011,"duration":7.48},{"text":"If perjured testimony was presented, Robinson told his client he would advise the court of that fact.","start":439.011,"stop":445.243,"duration":6.23},{"text":"And finally... and this is interesting and I'll quote it completely... Robinson told his client:","start":445.243,"stop":450.695,"duration":5.45},{"text":"\"I probably would be allowed to impeach that particular testimony. \"","start":450.695,"stop":455.005,"duration":4.31},{"text":"That's the end of the admonitions.","start":455.005,"stop":457.801,"duration":2.8},{"text":"And with that, Robinson instructed his client to think about it, and in the end Whiteside dropped his assertion that there was something metallic on Love's hands.","start":457.801,"stop":469.061,"duration":11.26},{"text":"And indeed, the question and answer periods in later meetings continued; and Whiteside appeared at his criminal trial and testified fully about the events of that evening and testified why he thought that indeed Calvin Love had a gun, but under questioning did not say that he actually saw the gun.","start":469.061,"stop":486.384,"duration":17.32}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Appel, I take it you take the position that under these circumstances the attorney had a duty to challenge his client's proposed false testimony?","start":486.384,"stop":500.785,"duration":14.4}]},{"speakerName":"Brent R.
