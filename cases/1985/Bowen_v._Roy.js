families with dependent children program and the food stamp program are obviously based on financial need, and the amount of the government grant is a function of family size and family income.","start":64.255,"stop":79.296,"duration":15.04},{"text":"As a result, all earned and unearned income of each family member has to be counted in determining eligibility and the amount of benefits.","start":79.296,"stop":89.683,"duration":10.39},{"text":"Therefore, under both programs, it is essential that benefit applicants furnish income and eligibility data for each member of the

Social Security Number of his younger daughter, Little Bird of the Snow.","start":106.661,"stop":126.137,"duration":19.48},{"text":"Roy claimed that as a result of his religious beliefs, he considers Social Security Numbers to be part of the so-called Great Evil, because the numbers are used by computers, and therefore rob people's spirits.","start":126.137,"stop":141.491,"duration":15.35},{"text":"Now, Roy testified that the evil of Social Security Numbers is related to their function as unique personal identifiers, and that if

power.","start":141.491,"stop":162.139,"duration":20.65}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Geller, the Court below found that the claim was based on a sincere religious

Roy.","start":356.248,"stop":363.666,"duration":7.42},{"text":"Now, as I said, the District Court did find that Roy had a sincere religious objection, and we are not objecting to that here, but by the same token, the District Court also found that the government had a compelling interest in using Social Security Numbers in order to effectively manage programs of this size to verify eligibility and the amount of benefits and to ferret out and deter fraud.","start":363.666,"stop":387.406,"duration":23.74},{"text":"And despite Roy's attempts to argue otherwise in this Court, I don't think there can be any serious objection to that finding by the District Court.","start":387.406,"stop":395.498,"duration":8.09},{"text":"There really can't be any doubt that the government has a compelling interest in seeing that $20 billion a year in welfare benefits are targeted to the people that Congress meant to receive them, and it is undisputed that the use of Social Security Numbers is instrumental in accomplishing that important objective.","start":395.498,"stop":413.523,"duration":18.03},{"text":"Now, the District Court failed to have found that there was a compelling government interest in using Social Security Numbers, and the question under the free exercise clause therefore became whether the government had any less restrictive means available to it to accomplish that objective in a way that wouldn't interfere with Roy's religious beliefs.","start":413.523,"stop":432.779,"duration":19.26},{"text":"We believe that the District Court was plainly wrong in the way it went about answering that question.","start":432.779,"stop":438.402,"duration":5.62},{"text":"I think the District Court first of all failed to appreciate that under this Court's free exercise cases any less restrictive alternative imposed on the government must be... must actually be capable of achieving the governmental... the compelling governmental interest, at least to the same extent that

there was no less restrictive alternative available to the government, the Court has never gone on to ask whether it makes any difference if we just exempt one

fact that the Court there found and I think quite correctly that there was a less restrictive alternative available to the government in those cases.","start":517.682,"stop":528.928,"duration":11.25},{"text":"In Sherbert, the purported government interest was to prevent fraudulent claims on the unemployment insurance fund.","start":528.928,"stop":535.535,"duration":6.61},{"text":"The way the state went about avoiding fraudulent claims was to simply wipe out any religious claim to an exemption.","start":535.535,"stop":544.655,"duration":9.12},{"text":"And what the Court said was, there is a less restrictive alternative.","start":544.655,"stop":547.42,"duration":2.76},{"text":"You

O'Connor.","start":556.495,"stop":558.524,"duration":2.03},{"text":"The court here clearly found, and I hope to read some of the court's findings in a few moments, that there was no less restrictive alternative that was equally effective as the Social Security requirement.","start":558.524,"stop":568.724,"duration":10.2},{"text":"The Court in Sherbert made the opposite finding.","start":568.724,"stop":572.989,"duration":4.26},{"text":"The Court in Sherbert didn't find that there was no less restrictive alternative, but it didn't much matter whether Mrs. Sherbert got her benefits.","start":572.989,"stop":580.376,"duration":7.39},{"text":"That is precisely what the District Court found here.","start":580.376,"stop":582.39,"duration":2.01},{"text":"We think there is absolutely no precedent in this Court's free exercise cases for that sort of a finding.","start":582.39,"stop":587.967,"duration":5.58},{"text":"Now, I don't think the Court should need any convincing about the massive nature of the government programs that we are dealing with here.","start":587.967,"stop":598.165,"duration":10.2},{"text":"There are about eleven million people who receive AFDC benefits each month, and there are about 20 million people who receive food stamps.","start":598.165,"stop":606.505,"duration":8.34},{"text":"And eligibility for both programs has to be redetermined periodically.","start":606.505,"stop":612.815,"duration":6.31},{"text":"With AFDC, I think it is every six months, and with the food stamp program, it is once every month or so.","start":612.815,"stop":618.563,"duration":5.75},{"text":"And that means that for 20 or 30 million recipients, there have to be periodic determinations about their eligibility for these benefits, and as I said earlier, the way those programs are run, the income of each family member, including children, has to be taken into account in determining whether a family is eligible for benefits and the amount of benefits.","start":618.563,"stop":640.477,"duration":21.91},{"text":"It seems self-evident that the only way you can run a program like this, the only way you can keep track of eligibility and verify what you are told and deter fraud is through the use of computers.","start":640.477,"stop":651.83,"duration":11.35},{"text":"And computers talk to each other through unique... through standardized data formats that use unique personal identifiers.","start":651.83,"stop":661.14,"duration":9.31},{"text":"And it was Congress's well-considered judgment based on numerous reports

quickly and reliably.","start":661.14,"stop":680.616,"duration":19.48},{"text":"Now, verification often requires that the records of a number of data bases be checked, Social Security records, and
