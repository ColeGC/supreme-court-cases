all.","start":271.712,"stop":289.262,"duration":17.55},{"text":"So they argue that all the profit they make comes at the sufferance of their members, and therefore, every dollar of profit does not

cost.","start":289.262,"stop":311.356,"duration":22.09},{"text":"The Claims Court accepted this group gift argument.","start":311.356,"stop":314.298,"duration":2.94},{"text":"It reasoned that the idea

is not a trade or business.","start":314.298,"stop":332.22,"duration":17.92},{"text":"This group gift theory, for which neither the courts below nor Respondent cites any authority or precedent, is wrong for four independent reasons.","start":332.22,"stop":342.087,"duration":9.87},{"text":"First of all, the group gift idea is foreclosed by the legislative history of the 1969 law in which Congress enacted its definition of the term trade or business.","start":342.087,"stop":354.757,"duration":12.67},{"text":"The House and Senate report accompanying that law discussed the group insurance activities of several categories of tax exempt groups, like fraternal beneficiary societies, such as the Knights of Columbus or Moose.","start":354.757,"stop":370.288,"duration":15.53},{"text":"These groups were authorized by the Code to provide insurance to their members and their dependents as part of their tax-exempt mission.","start":370.288,"stop":379.45,"duration":9.16},{"text":"That is, for these groups, the provision of insurance to members was a related function.","start":379.45,"stop":384.495,"duration":5.05},{"text":"Both the House and Senate reports refer to these group insurance activities as a business but note that those groups would be immune from tax on their insurance profits because for them the insurance business was related to their exempt function.","start":384.495,"stop":402.966,"duration":18.47},{"text":"For example, the House report wrote the bill excludes earnings from businesses related to an organization's exempt function, such as an insurance business run by a fraternal beneficial association for its members.","start":402.966,"stop":418.577,"duration":15.61},{"text":"Now, these groups, like the Endowment, sold insurance only through their members and the dependents of their members.","start":418.577,"stop":425.652,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Thus, it was true for them as for the Endowment that the members had the theoretical power to deprive them of any profits at all by making a group gift.","start":425.652,"stop":434.569,"duration":8.92},{"text":"But the Congress nevertheless characterized those group insurance activities as a business, and this we think shows that the group gift idea has no place under Section 513(c).","start":434.569,"stop":446.136,"duration":11.57},{"text":"Secondly, Respondents' group gift theory is foreclosed by three Courts of Appeals decisions that Respondent concedes to be correct.","start":446.136,"stop":455.602,"duration":9.47},{"text":"The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Circuits have held that another category of tax-exempt group, that is, a professional association organized under Section 501(c)(6) as a business league, does run a trade or business when it provides insurance services and products to its members and their dependents.","start":455.602,"stop":478.707,"duration":23.11},{"text":"The endowment makes no effort to distinguish its own insurance operation from the insurance operations of the groups in those other cases.","start":478.707,"stop":488.512,"duration":9.81},{"text":"Respondent agrees, in other words, that its full time staff of 40 people during, their working day provide
