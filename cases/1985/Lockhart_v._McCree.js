perspective.","start":85.57,"stop":97.544,"duration":11.97},{"text":"This case may be one of the most important criminal cases this Court will consider this term, for if the decision below is affirmed the potential is that some 90 percent of those inmates who comprise death row, numbering 1500, may have to be retried; that in 33 of the 37 states that allow for capital punishment their statutes may have to be changed through special sessions; and that some 3,000 to 5,000 inmates minimally who were charged with capital offenses but got sentences of less than death, either life without or life

trial.","start":138.588,"stop":146.577,"duration":7.99},{"text":"Factually, those nine prospective jurors were excluded due to the requirements of two entirely neutral and unassailable features of Arkansas state law.","start":146.577,"stop":156.266,"duration":9.69},{"text":"The first feature is the state of Arkansas has determined that in criminal cases the issue of guilt and innocence should be decided by the same jury, as we believe that the jury acts as a safeguard, if you will, in the criminal justice establishment between the defendant and that establishment: that the policy and the law that require that has been the policy in our state for more than seven decades.","start":156.266,"stop":179.695,"duration":23.43},{"text":"Secondly, the state of Arkansas naturally decided to exercise its option, when granted by Witherspoon, to prevent any juror from determining sentence who said he would, explicitly vowed, that he would under no circumstances follow state law, which

other persons who were charged with a capital offense but got some lesser offense, the need to determine factually whether the assertions of McCree are constitutional, and what we will be facing if in fact this Court affirms the decision of the court below.","start":242.397,"stop":261.461,"duration":19.06},{"text":"And so in the waiver of that procedure which we waived, and I admit that to this

policy.","start":261.461,"stop":274.252,"duration":12.79}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"But does the record disclose in this case why the state opted to proceed as it did

Honor, the answer to that question is yes, that in this instance, as with Grigsby in the case that was a companion case, that they were consolidated... and as the Court may be aware, Mr. Grigsby died

Court.","start":290.297,"stop":310.794,"duration":20.5}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't think that responds to my

follow both of these rules at the same time.","start":366.111,"stop":372.015,"duration":5.9},{"text":"He must demonstrate that the Constitution requires that Witherspoon excludibles be eligible for the guilty phase in juries in capital cases.","start":372.015,"stop":380.121,"duration":8.11},{"text":"Put differently, I submit to this Court that McCree must show that the Constitution demands that jurors be eligible for the jury who will not follow state law.","start":380.121,"stop":390.311,"duration":10.19},{"text":"This Court in Wainwright and Witt stated that the party seeking to exclude jurors for bias has the initial burden of establishing that bias.","start":390.311,"stop":398.432,"duration":8.12},{"text":"Clearly, Arkansas did that here when it discovered that those nine prospective jurors explicitly vowed that they would not follow state law.","start":398.432,"stop":406.272,"duration":7.84},{"text":"The right to an impartial jury based in the Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendments can be defined best succinctly, I think, as the right to have one's case decided solely on the basis of the evidence presented and of the instructions of the court.","start":406.272,"stop":420.913,"duration":14.64},{"text":"McCree's evidence does not even begin to show jury bias within the meaning of this Court's opinions.","start":420.913,"stop":426.567,"duration":5.65},{"text":"It provides no basis whatsoever for concern that the jurors who voted to convict McCree violated their oaths, or that they relied on something other than the evidence presented or the arguments of counsel, or that they disavowed and did not follow the instructions of the court.","start":426.567,"stop":440.909,"duration":14.34},{"text":"In fact, McCree has presented no attack of any kind on the performance of his jurors.","start":440.909,"stop":445.897,"duration":4.99},{"text":"The key flaw in McCree's approach is its failure to look at the individual members of his jury who actually decided his case.","start":445.897,"stop":453.836,"duration":7.94},{"text":"The only fact that we know about the jurors that were not allowed... that were allowed, excuse me, to serve, is that they stated they were willing to consider the full range of punishments in this case, which included the death penalty.","start":453.836,"stop":467.477,"duration":13.64},{"text":"The fact that the jury might possibly impose the death penalty alone if justified does not establish that those jurors in McCree's case are incapable of rendering an impartial verdict.","start":467.477,"stop":479.201,"duration":11.72},{"text":"To the contrary, there is a presumption of impartiality which attaches to McCree and to McCree's jurors in particular, which arises, one, from the trial court's determination that they were qualified to sit: and two, from their stated oath they would follow state law.","start":479.201,"stop":493.378,"duration":14.18}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Clark, doesn't your argument prove too

perfectly impartial.","start":494.913,"stop":503.15,"duration":8.24},{"text":"Would that be permissible?","start":503.15,"stop":504.519,"duration":1.37}]},{"speakerName":"John Steven

Court.","start":504.519,"stop":519.378,"duration":14.86},{"text":"But in this instance what McCree has said and the Eighth Circuit sort of merged was the impartiality and the cross-section violation.","start":519.378,"stop":526.198,"duration":6.82},{"text":"There's nothing in the record that demonstrates that McCree's jurors were anything other than impartial.","start":526.198,"stop":532.186,"duration":5.99}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I understand that.","start":532.186,"stop":533.002,"duration":0.82},{"text":"But in my hypothetical, if you had nothing left but Republicans would that be

impartial.","start":572.326,"stop":574.459,"duration":2.13},{"text":"It was the fact that these jurors were excluded not because of their belief in the death penalty; they were excluded because they would, they vowed explicitly they would, not follow state law.","start":574.459,"stop":584.55,"duration":10.09},{"text":"In the Court's example, if all Democrats said, we will not follow state law, and that left only Republicans, then I think you'd have a properly comprised jury.","start":584.55,"stop":592.49,"duration":7.94},{"text":"If you just excluded Democrats for the reason they held that title or avowed to that certain political party, then I think you're treading on constitutional violations that can be demonstrated by the defendant.","start":592.49,"stop":604.714,"duration":12.22}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, General Clark, I thought that Respondent's argument was more along the line of an argument that by excluding these jurors at the guilt-innocence phase of the case that it was a procedure whereby the state has organized the procedure in such a way that it would be more likely to result in a guilty verdict because of the evidence produced by the studies, not that the jury panel was in fact biased or not impartial, but that it was a procedure by which the state is more likely to obtain a jury which will vote for a guilty verdict.","start":604.714,"stop":655.313,"duration":50.6},{"text":"I thought that was the thrust of their argument.","start":655.313,"stop":657.765,"duration":2.45}]},{"speakerName":"John Steven Clark","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, Your Honor, if that is the thrust, I would look at it from this

penalty.","start":662.4,"stop":667.638,"duration":5.24},{"text":"It is the policy of the state of Arkansas, founded in this state interest, that we believe that same jury should consider guilt and

establishment.","start":667.638,"stop":682.881,"duration":15.24}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, that leads to the question of whether the state's interest, which of

Clark","textObjs":[{"text":"I submit to this Court that is.","start":696.39,"stop":698.273,"duration":1.88},{"text":"But in taking the procedural argument one step further, what McCree does argue, Your Honor, is in fact that the policy in Arkansas is not good policy: We don't like this policy of the unitary jury.","start":698.273,"stop":708.715,"duration":10.44},{"text":"That is not the same as, there is a constitutional violation in this process, and it's clearly distinguishable.","start":708.715,"stop":715.019,"duration":6.3},{"text":"If Mr. McCree wants the policy changed, his proper forum is the Arkansas legislature in changing that policy.","start":715.019,"stop":721.006,"duration":5.99},{"text":"But in regard to the procedure, the state interest that we determine that we want to protect first and foremost is that we believe that jury does act as that safeguard in that criminal justice establishment and it is important that the same jury hear guilt and punishment so as not

making that decision, or the reverse if you were the penalty jury.","start":721.006,"stop":749.275,"duration":28.27},{"text":"And for those reasons, as well as reasons of economy and efficiency, but

the issue as to the mere existence of any predilection or notion or concern by defendants in general, without some other objective criteria, is to establish a standard that allows them to be excluded
