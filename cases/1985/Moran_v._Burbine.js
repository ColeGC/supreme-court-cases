that the Respondent's three written waivers of his Miranda rights and his three signed confessions should be suppressed because, although, he had beer given the complete Miranda warnings prior to each confession and he had agreed to waive his rights, his waivers were not knowingly made whom he had not requested, had because an attorney, called the police station where he happened to be in custody, had been given misleading information by whomever answered the telephone and was told that there would be no further interrogation of the Respondent that night, and the Respondent was not informed of

said that he had had nothing to do with Mary Jo's murder.","start":134.383,"stop":143.173,"duration":8.79},{"text":"And so they put him back into the smaller room where he had been kept.","start":143.173,"stop":146.941,"duration":3.77},{"text":"But about ten minutes later, they heard a banging and a kicking on his door, and he was brought out into the main room and he told them
