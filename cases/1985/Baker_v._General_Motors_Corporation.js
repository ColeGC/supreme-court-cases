Chief, Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":57.879,"stop":61.653,"duration":3.77},{"text":"Appellants are non-striking General Motors employees who were laid off due to strikes elsewhere.","start":61.653,"stop":70.177,"duration":8.52},{"text":"It is agreed that the only basis for the labor dispute disqualification in this case was because they pay emergency dues.","start":70.177,"stop":81.224,"duration":11.05},{"text":"The issue is may a state deny unemployment compensation to these Appellants solely because they paid emergency or increased dues lawfully required as a condition of remaining union members where the dues were for the union strike fund from which strikers later receive strike benefits.","start":81.224,"stop":105.681,"duration":24.46},{"text":"Appellant's union had a convention in October and voted to require as a condition of membership emergency dues of all UAW members in the United States and Canada.","start":105.681,"stop":123.583,"duration":17.9},{"text":"And, it is agreed and stipulated that these Appellants paid $20 to $40 each for the months of October and November, 1967 to their own local unions which then sent the increase or emergency dues to the international union's strike fund.","start":123.583,"stop":143.997,"duration":20.41},{"text":"Appellants continued working at their own plants.","start":143.997,"stop":150.209,"duration":6.21},{"text":"Their local union settled their contract which Appellants ratified.","start":150.209,"stop":156.612,"duration":6.4},{"text":"That year there was no national strike at General Motors Corporation.","start":156.612,"stop":163.678,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Instead, the General Motors agreement was settled in December and ratified by the union members.","start":163.678,"stop":173.546,"duration":9.87},{"text":"In late January, three General Motors foundry locals went on strike over local issues and after those 11 to 12-day strikes ended, they received no more than $18 from the international union's strike fund.","start":173.546,"stop":193.968,"duration":20.42},{"text":"Those foundry strikes caused part shortages and resulted in layoffs at Appellant's plant.","start":193.968,"stop":203.775,"duration":9.81},{"text":"Appellants were comparatively few members at each plant who were selected because they had low seniority and they were laid off from those plants by General Motors and they applied for unemployment compensation for that February, three months after they paid those dues.","start":203.775,"stop":220.336,"duration":16.56},{"text":"They were found eligible under state law in the sense that they had worked long enough to earn their compensation, they had enough credit weeks, they were available for work, they were seeking work, they wanted to continue working, and they were involuntarily unemployed.","start":220.336,"stop":236.555,"duration":16.22},{"text":"The labor dispute disqualification was asserted as a reason for denying them compensation and under all aspects or all parts of the Michigan Labor Dispute statute, they were not disqualified except one.","start":236.555,"stop":253.808,"duration":17.25},{"text":"What we mean by that is they were held by all agencies and courts to not be in the same locations as the strikers, they were not participating in any foundry strikes, they were not interested in them in the sense that they could not benefit from them nor could they influence those negotiations or strikes.","start":253.808,"stop":273.61,"duration":19.8},{"text":"They were disqualified because they had financed the labor dispute as held by the Michigan court because they had paid those increased or emergency dues the previous October.","start":273.61,"stop":291.102,"duration":17.49},{"text":"If possible, we would like to get into our argument a little bit and then try to respond to some of the points made by General Motors.","start":291.102,"stop":303.841,"duration":12.74},{"text":"It is pretty well agreed that Appellants would not have been disqualified from their unemployment compensation but for the facts that they chose to remain union members and paid these increased or emergency dues.","start":303.841,"stop":319.219,"duration":15.38},{"text":"The Michigan Supreme Court correctly held that this conflicts with their Section 7 right to assist their union and it also conflicts with their right to join and remain union members if they choose to do so.","start":319.219,"stop":336.041,"duration":16.82},{"text":"Under this Court's ordinary preemption rules, state action which conflicts with such Section 7 rights would be preempted, wouldn't stand, unless Congress affirmatively intended to allow such a conflict.","start":336.041,"stop":352.44,"duration":16.4}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Rossen, did any workers refuse to pay the increased

dues, these emergency dues in accordance with the UAW Constitution.","start":359.526,"stop":377.519,"duration":17.99},{"text":"Thus, there is no evidence that anyone refused to pay the dues.","start":377.519,"stop":385.543,"duration":8.02}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"What would the union do with a member who refused to pay the increased dues for the purposes of financing the strike?","start":385.543,"stop":396.339,"duration":10.8}]},{"speakerName":"Jordan Rossen","textObjs":[{"text":"There is no evidence that the union took any action against any of the members in terms of trying to get someone's job or anything else under Section 8(a)(3).","start":396.339,"stop":413.671,"duration":17.33},{"text":"It is our position that the dues were lawfully required dues under the union constitution and, in fact, it is stipulated and found that they were paid under the union constitution and, thus, they were required to be union members.","start":413.671,"stop":428.98,"duration":15.31},{"text":"So, failure to pay those dues based on those stipulations would jeopardize a person's union membership if he refused or she refused to pay those dues.","start":428.98,"stop":438.948,"duration":9.97}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you concede that the state can disqualify non-strikers who finance a

right.","start":471.249,"stop":472.398,"duration":1.15}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"So you concede then that it can apply if it is payment other than union dues?","start":472.398,"stop":479.734,"duration":7.34}]},{"speakerName":"Jordan Rossen","textObjs":[{"text":"We concede that it can apply and be used as a disqualification when it is not based on the exercise of someone's Section 7 rights.","start":479.734,"stop":490.033,"duration":10.3}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't think that answers the question.","start":490.033,"stop":495.116,"duration":5.08},{"text":"That really doesn't answer the question, because, in effect, it would be an exercise of a Section 7 right to finance a strike, wouldn't it?","start":495.116,"stop":502.168,"duration":7.05}]},{"speakerName":"Jordan Rossen","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, it may or may not, Justice Stevens.","start":502.168,"stop":508.082,"duration":5.91},{"text":"For example, there are situations where an individual might send money if there is an existing strike and that individual could do it alone, that individual may or may not be a union member, and that might be used as a basis for disqualifying someone from financing and it would not involve the exercise of Section 7 rights.","start":508.082,"stop":539.825,"duration":31.74}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"What if you did not... I am still not sure of your answer to Justice O'Connor's question is why I am following up.","start":539.825,"stop":546.297,"duration":6.47},{"text":"What if they had just sent out a special assessment for the purpose of financing the strike and then as a by-product of that strike these people were laid off temporarily.","start":546.297,"stop":555.803,"duration":9.51},{"text":"What your position be?","start":555.803,"stop":558.224,"duration":2.42}]},{"speakerName":"Jordan Rossen","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, our position first of all is that is not what happened here.","start":558.224,"stop":562.909,"duration":4.68}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"It is a different case, I understand.","start":562.909,"stop":564.459,"duration":1.55}]},{"speakerName":"Jordan Rossen","textObjs":[{"text":"But, I didn't want to leave any misunderstanding on that score.","start":564.459,"stop":569.233,"duration":4.77},{"text":"But, if the union did that and all the money was going to the strikers--","start":569.233,"stop":580.471,"duration":11.24}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, it goes into a large fund and the fund in turn is used to support the--","start":580.471,"stop":584.862,"duration":4.39}]},{"speakerName":"Jordan Rossen","textObjs":[{"text":"--I was going to say if the money was going to the strikers and the union is a mere collection agent, I am not sure if it makes a difference if it is labelled dues or not and I am not sure that would really involve assisting the union, even though the union is a collection agent, any more than if the union collects money for the United Fund and sends it to someone.","start":584.862,"stop":603.184,"duration":18.32},{"text":"But, if the money goes into a large pot, then I think... into the union's strike fund, even though unlike this case there is an existing strike at the time, then I think the case would be very much like General Motors versus Bowling which was decided by the Illinois Supreme Court and the Illinois Supreme Court there said that because the union was really deciding how this money was going to be paid, the union would decide when to pay it and how much and to whom, and it was not these dues... and there they were people in the same plant paying dues, increased dues, double dues, the Illinois Supreme Court said it would not interpret financing under its statute to apply to those payments because they were dues and the union really was deciding how it ought to pay them.","start":603.184,"stop":657.341,"duration":54.16},{"text":"Now, that is different from a situation where the payer knows that 100 percent of the money paid is going to... even if it goes into a pot... is going to be sent to people on the existing strike.","start":657.341,"stop":670.55,"duration":13.21},{"text":"But, we think the Bowling situation, the example that I gave there, it is our position that that would be preempted even though it would leave our case as a much stronger case for preemption, we believe that there also would be preemption in that case and that Congress did not intend in the National Labor Relations Act or the Social Security Act to disqualify anyone for financing, let alone for paying dues.","start":670.55,"stop":700.63,"duration":30.08},{"text":"Did that get closer?","start":700.63,"stop":704.051,"duration":3.42}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"--Close.","start":704.051,"stop":709.835,"duration":5.78}]},{"speakerName":"Jordan Rossen","textObjs":[{"text":"In terms of the legislative history, the National Labor Relations Act does not provide any guidance as to congressional intent in this case.","start":709.835,"stop":725.965,"duration":16.13},{"text":"And, in 1935 when the Social Security Act was passed, there was no financing provision in any state labor dispute statute.","start":725.965,"stop":735.322,"duration":9.36},{"text":"So, for that reason you cannot say, unlike in New York Telephone, for example, where there was an existing statute that Congress perhaps was aware of, you cannot say that Congress was aware of any financing provision in 1935.","start":735.322,"stop":753.123,"duration":17.8},{"text":"Now, the State of Michigan relies on 1936 action by the Social Security Board.","start":753.123,"stop":759.147,"duration":6.02},{"text":"After the Social Security Act was passed where the Social Security Board recommended changing the disqualification of everyone in a struck establishment to only apply to situations where people participate, finance, or are directly interested in those excused within that establishment.","start":759.147,"stop":778.541,"duration":19.39},{"text":"But, in 1940, the Social Security Board, aware of a few applications by state agencies, not courts, recommended eliminating any financing provisions in these statutes because, as the Social Security Board said, it might be used to disqualify people for solely for payment of dues.","start":778.541,"stop":803.807,"duration":25.27},{"text":"Now, in 1943, Congress indicated its awareness of this Social Security Board action because it changed a District of Columbia statute to do as suggested in 1936 by adding participating and directly interest, but it specifically omitted the financing provision.","start":803.807,"stop":824.43,"duration":20.62},{"text":"And, since 1935, no state court until this Michigan court has ever disqualified anyone under a financing provision for solely paying union dues.","start":824.43,"stop":841.283,"duration":16.85},{"text":"Now, what we mean by that when we saying \"for solely paying union dues\", we mean in other cases where dues may have been involved, the people were also in the same establishment as the strikers, they were also held to be interested in the strike financially, and they were also held to be participating, so there is no pure dues holding in unemployment insurance history in the United States by a court until this one, and there--","start":841.283,"stop":869.894,"duration":28.61},{"text":"This gets to be a little bit back to Justice Stevens' question.","start":869.894,"stop":873.357,"duration":3.46},{"text":"There is something else that is also flukey about this Michigan decision.","start":873.357,"stop":880.96,"duration":7.6},{"text":"The financing provisions came out of English law and they were aimed at situations where people in a factory were striking and other people, knowing of those strikes, sent money to those strikers when then caused their own layoffs.","start":880.96,"stop":896.621,"duration":15.66},{"text":"In every other financing decision in the United States, including agencies, whether or not they involve dues, they all involve the same situation of an existing strike that people were sending money to.","start":896.621,"stop":912.591,"duration":15.97},{"text":"We mention this because it emphasizes the unusual quality and nature of the Michigan decision which makes it, in our opinion, just as unusual as what Florida did in Nash where Florida was the only state to interpret its labor dispute disqualification in a bizarre way and yet this Court, despite the fact that that was unusual, did not allow Florida to punish that worker because she exercised statutory rights.","start":912.591,"stop":950.586,"duration":38},{"text":"General Motors relies on this Court's decision in New York Telephone and says that because Congress, as indicated in New York Telephone, was apparently aware of a state statute which paid benefits to strikers after disqualification and also disqualified strikers.","start":950.586,"stop":981.526,"duration":30.94},{"text":"Therefore, it should be assumed that Congress also intended to permit disqualifying anyone else who exercises other Section 7 rights wherever there is a strike.","start":981.526,"stop":993.875,"duration":12.35},{"text":"But, as Your Honors know, New York Telephone rested on awareness by Congress of a specific statute which did that, and as we have shown, there was no statute in existence in 1935 that did what happened to these people.","start":993.875,"stop":1012.568,"duration":18.69},{"text":"And, the fact that Congress was aware that a state may impede the right to strike does not mean that Congress intended or should be implied to permit a state to impede all other Section 7 rights or rather all other NLRA rights, and certainly Nash is an example of that holding.","start":1012.568,"stop":1036.262,"duration":23.69},{"text":"And, General Motors concedes in its brief that the state could not disqualify persons because they are union members.","start":1036.262,"stop":1044.067,"duration":7.81},{"text":"So, there are situations where a state's labor dispute disqualification has been limited.","start":1044.067,"stop":1049.59,"duration":5.52},{"text":"And, striking for NLRA purposes and for unemployment insurance purposes is different than other Section 7 rights, particularly the rights of free association.","start":1049.59,"stop":1064.511,"duration":14.92},{"text":"Strikers leave work and things can happen to them under the NLRA that economically disadvantage them.","start":1064.511,"stop":1073.968,"duration":9.46},{"text":"General Motors could have replaced the foundry strikers if it had wished, permanent replace them, but General Motors could not have punished these Appellants because they chose to pay these dues even if there was a foundry strike in existence at the time and even if some of those dues reached those foundry strikers.","start":1073.968,"stop":1093.189,"duration":19.22},{"text":"General Motors could not have laid them off because they paid these dues, and yet General Motors is asking this Court, as it did in Michigan, to punish these claimants because they paid these dues.","start":1093.189,"stop":1107.719,"duration":14.53}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
