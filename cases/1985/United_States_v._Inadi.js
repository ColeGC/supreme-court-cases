Frey","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court today is whether the Federal Rules of Evidence are unconstitutional insofar as they permit the introduction in evidence in a criminal trial of co-conspirator declarations without requiring the prosecution to produce the declare or to demonstrate his unavailability.","start":53.551,"stop":76.047,"duration":22.5},{"text":"Now, in terms of potential impact, this may be the most important critical procedure case that the Court has had to decide in the years that I have been in the Solicitor General's office.","start":76.047,"stop":87.355,"duration":11.31},{"text":"While affirmance of the Third Circuit's decision would probably have little impact on the trial as seen by the jurors, the behind the scenes effect on the allocation of criminal justice system resources would be dramatic.","start":87.355,"stop":101.282,"duration":13.93},{"text":"On this case, which was a drug prosecution, the prosecution sought to use five recorded conversations as evidence against respondent.","start":101.282,"stop":112.137,"duration":10.86},{"text":"Three of those conversations he was a party to, and we're between him and a co-conspirator, John Lazaro.","start":112.137,"stop":119.409,"duration":7.27},{"text":"A fourth conversation was between two individuals who testified as prosecution witnesses at trial, and the fifth conversation was between Lazaro and a co-conspirator named Levin, who invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege and was found unavailable at trial.","start":119.409,"stop":137.205,"duration":17.8},{"text":"Respondent demanded that the prosecution show the unavailability of any co-conspirator declarants, and to accommodate the District Court's practical wishes, the prosecution did subpoena Lazaro to appear for trial, but he failed to appear, allegedly due to car troubles.","start":137.205,"stop":158.534,"duration":21.33},{"text":"Ultimately, the District Court ruled that Lazaro's statements on these intercepted conversations were admissible under the traditional co-conspirator exception now embodied in Rule 801 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.","start":158.534,"stop":171.628,"duration":13.09},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed.","start":171.628,"stop":174.663,"duration":3.04},{"text":"It, too, found that Rule 801 was satisfied, but it found that the confrontation clause was violated because the prosecution had not satisfactorily demonstrated that the co-conspirator Lazaro was unavailable to testify at trial.","start":174.663,"stop":191.355,"duration":16.69},{"text":"Now, in reaching this ruling, it relied almost entirely on dicta from this Court's decision in Ohio against Roberts.","start":191.355,"stop":199.795,"duration":8.44},{"text":"We have discussed at some length in our brief both the historical evolution of the confrontation right of common law and its adoption in the Sixth Amendment and the parallel but distinct development of the hearsay rule and exceptions, including the co-conspirator exception, and I have no intention of repeating that here.","start":199.795,"stop":218.157,"duration":18.36},{"text":"Suffice it to say that the co-conspirator exception emerged simultaneously with the adoption of the confrontation right and the Sixth Amendment, and as it was refined during the period from 1780 to 1980, it was, as far as I know, never suggested by any Court or any legislature that a showing of unavailability of the extrajudicial declarant, co-conspirator, was required.","start":218.157,"stop":244.924,"duration":26.77},{"text":"And the same is true, I might add, of the vast majority of other hearsay exceptions and exemptions.","start":244.924,"stop":251.496,"duration":6.57},{"text":"Can it be that the judges, the legislators, the practitioners, and the scholars who have contributed to the evolution of the common law of evidence over this period and who contributed to the Federal Rules of Evidence, and in doing so, who took into account in their consideration of hearsay rules the very same interests that are said to underlie the confrontation clause, can it be that all of these people have so consistently violated fundamental principles of fair play embodied in the somewhat vague and general language of the Sixth Amendment?","start":251.496,"stop":283.115,"duration":31.62},{"text":"Can it be that for decade after decade, thousands of state as well as federal courtrooms across the land have seen the basic right of confrontation repeatedly violated by the admission of co-conspirator declarations without any showing of the unavailability of the declarant?","start":283.115,"stop":300.161,"duration":17.05},{"text":"We think that is not possible.","start":300.161,"stop":302.763,"duration":2.6},{"text":"Far more likely, in our opinion, is the view that the dictum in Ohio against Roberts referred to the class of cases, that is, prior testimony and the like, in which the unavailability requirement in this Court's decisions cited in Roberts parallel a similar development of the hearsay rules.","start":302.763,"stop":321.724,"duration":18.96}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"I am curious, Mr.

several states have determined as a matter of state constitutional law to require the enforcement of proof of unavailability and reliability to produce evidence such as this in a co-conspirator situation.","start":330.346,"stop":355.647,"duration":25.3},{"text":"Has the experience of those states been such that law enforcement agencies have been hampered in

Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"You say in effect that if the declaration of an adverse party can be admitted against in open court, the declaration of an adverse party can be admitted on the same principal?","start":472.188,"stop":486.698,"duration":14.51}]},{"speakerName":"Mr. Andrew L. Frey","textObjs":[{"text":"That is a part of the rationale for the co-conspirator declaration, and we would certainly say that, but I think what we are saying is broader in this immediate connection, which is that it was never intended for the confrontation clause to concern itself with most kinds of hearsay.","start":486.698,"stop":504.66,"duration":17.96},{"text":"The early cases which are cited at Page 22 of our brief, state cases, suggest that the witnesses that the Sixth Amendment says and the state constitutional provision said the defendant had to be allowed to confront are those people who appear in court and give testimony about the hearsay declaration.","start":504.66,"stop":523.073,"duration":18.41},{"text":"Now, I am not suggesting that that is the limit of the reach of the provision, but in the Mattox case of this Court, which is the first case to really consider this issue, the Court said that the primary object of the constitutional provision in question was to prevent depositions or ex parte affidavits such as were sometimes admitted in civil cases being used against a prisoner in lieu of personal examination and cross examination of the witness.","start":523.073,"stop":550.807,"duration":27.73},{"text":"Now, that also, I think, is to some extent the view of Wigmore and Justice Harlan's view in concurrence in Dutton against Evans.","start":550.807,"stop":562.448,"duration":11.64},{"text":"And the Court indicated in Roberts that that view had not been accepted by this Court, and at the other extreme is the view which I understand respondent to take and which may be supported by dictum in Dutton and Roberts, that all hearsay is regulated by the confrontation clause.","start":562.448,"stop":580.677,"duration":18.23},{"text":"It doesn't mean it is excluded.","start":580.677,"stop":581.727,"duration":1.05},{"text":"It means it is regulated.","start":581.727,"stop":583.412,"duration":1.69},{"text":"Now, I would propose to the Court that the better view is that out of court declarations of a kind that are retrospective but done in contemplation of trial, that are of a testimonial nature... when the Sixth Amendment refers to a witness, what it is referring to is somebody who is giving testimony or the functional equivalent of testimony.","start":583.412,"stop":607.311,"duration":23.9},{"text":"That could reach so far as to include accomplice confessions under police interrogation, which are retrospective, and in large part obtained for purposes of solving crimes and litigating cases.","start":607.311,"stop":620.202,"duration":12.89},{"text":"It does not, however, reach business records, present sense impression, co-conspirator declarations, the kind of res gestae exceptions that the main body of hearsay exception law is concerned with.","start":620.202,"stop":635.58,"duration":15.38},{"text":"In any event, even if the domain of the confrontation clause does embrace hearsay generally, it seems to us extraordinarily clear that the clause does not invalidate traditional evidence law regarding the exceptions to the prohibition on use of hearsay.","start":635.58,"stop":652.34,"duration":16.76},{"text":"And, of course, why should it do that when these exceptions were developed with consideration of the very same concerns, the importance of cross examination, the necessity in some circumstances of withholding from the jury evidence, or the necessity of making it available, that underlie the confrontation clause.","start":652.34,"stop":674.288,"duration":21.95},{"text":"In cases like Mattox and the Delaney case in 1924 which involved a confrontation clause, co-conspirator declarations, brushed off the suggestion that traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule might run afoul of the confrontation clause, and in both Dutton against Evans and Ohio against Roberts, the Court was at pains to reaffirm that the traditional exceptions were not being called into question by those decisions.","start":674.288,"stop":702.023,"duration":27.74}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Does it make any difference at all that the rule treats co-conspirator statements as exempt from being hearsay, and the other rules treat exceptions to the hearsay rule?","start":702.023,"stop":719.067,"duration":17.04}]},{"speakerName":"Mr. Andrew L.

reliability.","start":799.184,"stop":810.889,"duration":11.71},{"text":"I am not sure why she thinks that helps her.","start":810.889,"stop":812.957,"duration":2.07},{"text":"If agency is the rationale, why shouldn't the principal produce this agent rather than the principal's accountant in the litigation?","start":812.957,"stop":822.597,"duration":9.64},{"text":"Now, of course, Lazaro may no longer have seen Inadi's agent at the time of trial, but the point that I think is important is that the decision has been made consistently throughout time that no showing of unavailability is to be required in connection with co-conspirator declarations.","start":822.597,"stop":841.361,"duration":18.76},{"text":"How would you use the confrontation clause to veto that judgment?","start":841.361,"stop":847.415,"duration":6.05},{"text":"I just simply don't see what you would look to as a source of arriving at some different conclusion.","start":847.415,"stop":854.734,"duration":7.32},{"text":"Now, I will say with respect to the Roberts dictum, because I think that is the source of most of the holdings that have done against our position, that I think they misread what Roberts says.","start":854.734,"stop":867.494,"duration":12.76},{"text":"First of all, it seems to me plain that the dictum in Roberts was meant to be descriptive rather than prescriptive, but it would be a wholly inaccurate description of the state of the law with respect to most co-con... most hearsay exceptions including the co-conspirator declaration, but totally accurate as an explanations of the treatment of depositions and prior testimony?","start":867.494,"stop":892.859,"duration":25.37},{"text":"Now, secondly, if you read the dictum literally, it goes too far, because it not only imposes the requirement of showing unavailability and reliability on co-conspirator declarations, but it invalidates all of Rule 803.","start":892.859,"stop":912.487,"duration":19.63},{"text":"Now, respondent is going to try to get around that, but the fact of the matter is that if you read it literally it makes Rule 803 unconstitutional as well as Rule 801, if you don't read it literally, then I don't understand why you should not read it as limited to the proposition established by the cases that it cites, which are prior testimony cases?","start":912.487,"stop":935.75,"duration":23.26},{"text":"Now, let me turn to the question of policy, because I do think that is what concerns us so gravely about the third circuit's rule.","start":935.75,"stop":946.522,"duration":10.77},{"text":"The question is, assuming that the Court has the license under the Constitution to do so, whether there is any reason why the Court, concerned as it must be with fair and efficient administration of criminal justice, would want the unavailability role that the Third Circuit has adopted in this case.","start":946.522,"stop":966.103,"duration":19.58},{"text":"In other words, can we expect significant benefits to the fairness and accuracy of the criminal trial to be derived at acceptable cost from this requirement.","start":966.103,"stop":975.209,"duration":9.11},{"text":"It seems to me the answer is clearly no.","start":975.209,"stop":977.91,"duration":2.7},{"text":"Let me look first at the benefits.","start":977.91,"stop":980.779,"duration":2.87},{"text":"The first point to notice about the Third Circuits's rule is that it does not keep out evidence that the jury can't be trusted to hear.","start":980.779,"stop":989.385,"duration":8.61},{"text":"The co-conspirator declarations come in if the declarant is shown to be unavailable, and under the Third Circuits's rule, although I think not under the position that respondent was requesting in District Court, they come in if the declarant is available and is produced.","start":989.385,"stop":1006.68,"duration":17.29},{"text":"Part of the reason they come in, and the reason why at least that part of the Third Circuit's rule is good, is because the declarations have independent evidentiary value apart from any in court testimony that the declarant may give.","start":1006.68,"stop":1020.237,"duration":13.56},{"text":"There are statements made while the objective of the illegal transaction was being advanced, and for the purpose of advancement.","start":1020.237,"stop":1030.11,"duration":9.87},{"text":"By the time the witness appears in court many factors may have played on him to affect his credibility.","start":1030.11,"stop":1036.199,"duration":6.09},{"text":"I am not saying in any given case which... whether the co-conspirator declaration or the in court testimony is more valuable.","start":1036.199,"stop":1042.936,"duration":6.74},{"text":"However, the co-conspirator declaration is independently valuable, and it comes in whether the declarant is available or unavailable.","start":1042.936,"stop":1050.424,"duration":7.49},{"text":"The only time it doesn't come in, and the defendant gets a windfall, is if the prosecution has been negligent and has let the declarant somehow or another get out of its clutches between the time of the investigation and the time of the trial and it is found culpable or negligent having done so.","start":1050.424,"stop":1069.603,"duration":19.18},{"text":"A second point, and more important in terms of the lack of benefit is it does not enhance the ability of the defendant to adduce exculpatory evidence.","start":1069.603,"stop":1079.193,"duration":9.59},{"text":"After all, the question in this case is why didn't respondent, if Lazaro's testimony was so important to him, why didn't respondent subpoena him, put him on the stand?","start":1079.193,"stop":1090.084,"duration":10.89},{"text":"The fact of the matter is that when the issue was raised by the District Court, respondent's counsel said that was a very serious question whether they actually wanted respondent to testify.","start":1090.084,"stop":1099.022,"duration":8.94},{"text":"What they wanted was the government to show that he was unavailable or forego the use of the co-conspirator declarations.","start":1099.022,"stop":1106.176,"duration":7.15}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
