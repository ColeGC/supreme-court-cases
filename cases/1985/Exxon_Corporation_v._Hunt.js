through.","start":871.228,"stop":879.959,"duration":8.73},{"text":"Two strains in that discussion, I submit, give real content to the pre-emption.","start":879.959,"stop":886.3,"duration":6.34},{"text":"The first one is about money, where it was going to come from and how much they were going to need.","start":886.3,"stop":890.314,"duration":4.01},{"text":"They finally decided that a fund of $1.6 billion would be enough to make a start on this massive job.","start":890.314,"stop":896.109,"duration":5.8},{"text":"Now, this money could have come from general revenues because all of us in some measure bear some responsibility for hazardous wastes.","start":896.109,"stop":903.966,"duration":7.86},{"text":"It could have come from a tax on generators.","start":903.966,"stop":906.167,"duration":2.2},{"text":"These are manufacturers, miners, milling people, some 260,000, who directly contribute to this.","start":906.167,"stop":913.007,"duration":6.84},{"text":"Nonetheless, it was decided not to do that, to impose this tax only on oil and chemicals, some 30 chemicals, with the result that about 400... about 900 taxpayers bore the entire burden of the federal waste program.","start":913.007,"stop":926.971,"duration":13.96},{"text":"Thereafter, there was considerable discussion and concern that those people should not be taxes again for this purpose, at least for the five-year experimental period during which CERCLA was to be in effect.","start":926.971,"stop":939.435,"duration":12.46},{"text":"So that, the basic consideration there was a recognition that oil and chemicals were bearing a disproportionate burden of the cost of federal waste cleanup, and that at least for this period when the federal program was getting itself going and finding what needed to be done, they shouldn't be subject to multiple state taxation.","start":939.435,"stop":958.02,"duration":18.59},{"text":"They could have been taxed in all 50 states.","start":958.02,"stop":960.363,"duration":2.34},{"text":"The other theme that runs through the discussions is the need to provide for federal-state cooperation in order to achieve effectively this nationwide program of dealing with the waste, and this involved the states nominating sites and working with the federal government, and indeed paying ten percent of the total cost.","start":960.363,"stop":983.73,"duration":23.37},{"text":"So, it was necessary, and many legislators suggested that this was going to be difficult enough with one federal program without having

I submit, fully support our contention that what was intended was that the states would not put additional taxes on oil and chemicals for these same purposes, and it didn't have to do with actual payment but rather with the purpose of the tax.","start":1000.16,"stop":1017.09,"duration":16.93},{"text":"Now, the New Jersey Supreme Court, in accepting the actually paid argument, relied almost entirely on a single incident in the legislative history of CERCLA, and in a colloquy on the Senate floor, Senator Randolph, the Floor Leader, did agree in response to two complicated leading

could be spent however they wanted to spend it.","start":1077.239,"stop":1079.175,"duration":1.94},{"text":"And, New Jersey had a deep interest in that because it did have such a fund.","start":1079.175,"stop":1083.033,"duration":3.86},{"text":"It should be noted in this connection that earlier in this colloquy both Senator Bradley and Senator Randolph referred to pre-emption

this concern to prevent federal taxation.","start":1083.033,"stop":1107.85,"duration":24.82},{"text":"I think, in answer to Justice O'Connor's question, I have dealt with an argument New Jersey makes which appears to be that even if our view of the pre-emption is accepted, this spill fund should nonetheless survive.","start":1107.85,"stop":1124.203,"duration":16.35},{"text":"One reason is that it says it has other purposes, these being the oil spill, particularly, and as I indicated the purpose is what is important and they haven't changed the tax rate, and the oil spill expenditures are very, very small.","start":1124.203,"stop":1135.198,"duration":11},{"text":"The other argument that it seems to make is that in fact it has refrained from spending money on certain sites.","start":1135.198,"stop":1143.508,"duration":8.31},{"text":"Now, even if that were factually correct, and I'll show in just a moment that it is not, we submit that spill funds should still be stricken because it is not the manner in which the money is spent that determines pre-emption, it is the purpose, and the purpose remains to clean up hazardous wastes, the same purpose as CERCLA.","start":1143.508,"stop":1163.532,"duration":20.02},{"text":"However, the records that are before the Court here show that New Jersey did not refrain from spending on CERCLA
