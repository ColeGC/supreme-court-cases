the implied preemption theory.","start":787.86,"stop":795.985,"duration":8.13},{"text":"But on appeal, the respondents have argued that Section 152(b), although by its express design it refers to all

relevance to depreciation accounting.","start":795.985,"stop":820.251,"duration":24.27},{"text":"They claim that the terms charges, classifications, and practices refer to rate structures or rates for services, but their position ignores the fact that that statute uses very different language than Congress had intended to just refer to rates for services.","start":820.251,"stop":837.382,"duration":17.13},{"text":"It says that the FCC cannot assert jurisdiction over charges, classifications, and practices for or in connection with local rates,

no reference to 220 and simply refers to rate structure attributes extreme redundancy to Congress by assuming that Congress used six terms to mean one.","start":853.181,"stop":864.899,"duration":11.72},{"text":"With respect to Section 220(j), and that is the provision again which calls for a study by the FCC to look into the reasonableness of harmonizing state and federal powers over depreciation, they argued that that provision was nothing more than a paraphrase of the Senate pro-preemption 220(j).","start":864.899,"stop":882.751,"duration":17.85},{"text":"But again, that statute belies their position, because it calls for the harmonization of state and federal powers, and clearly by

order.","start":882.751,"stop":900.782,"duration":18.03},{"text":"With regard to Section 213(h), they haven't answered us, and frankly, we can't criticize them for not doing so, because our position

that.","start":900.782,"stop":920.536,"duration":19.75},{"text":"But we have here two very different readings of the Communications Act.","start":920.536,"stop":926.36,"duration":5.82},{"text":"We

another.","start":937.578,"stop":939.05,"duration":1.47},{"text":"Each word in each statute has a meaning, and we had the respondents' reading, the new reading, which has pieces in the legislative puzzle clashing.","start":939.05,"stop":946.644,"duration":7.59},{"text":"They conflict.","start":946.644,"stop":947.305,"duration":0.66},{"text":"You have Section 152(b) referring clearly to other

Section 152(b), according to their position, meaning only one term.","start":957.513,"stop":963.657,"duration":6.14},{"text":"You have Sections 220(h), referring to waivers, and Section 220(i), a

new reading of the Act violates a number of rules of statutory construction, but the Fourth Circuit was still willing to preempt, and it did so by reasoning that even though this increase or this order by the FCC is really designed to increase local rates, that is still justified because it is going to further general responsibilities found in Section 151 of the Act.","start":975.805,"stop":1004.804,"duration":29},{"text":"But that sort of reasoning, as the lower court dissent indicated, really allows an agency to overreach with its general purpose language.","start":1004.804,"stop":1014.029,"duration":9.23},{"text":"It invites an agency to hold general purpose language such as 151, which really has no legislative history to it, and simply tells the FCC, go and regulate interstate matters, to hold that language up to the light and to manipulate it until it is able to derive a stream of unstated purposes which are really predesigned to conflict with the state law to be overridden.","start":1014.029,"stop":1034.673,"duration":20.64},{"text":"And that process is particularly bothersome when it overrides historic, deeply routed police
