Amendment respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a fishing boat, the Sea Otter, and thus was entitled to challenge the search of the boat as the basis for seeking the suppression of evidence.","start":71.252,"stop":85.84,"duration":14.59},{"text":"The District Court held that respondent had no such standing to move for suppression.","start":85.84,"stop":90.324,"duration":4.48},{"text":"On respondent's appeal pursuant to a conditional guilty plea that reserved the issue of his standing to challenge the cert, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed and held that respondent did have an expectation of privacy in the Sea Otter.","start":90.324,"stop":104.942,"duration":14.62},{"text":"Now, the facts relevant to this issue are set forth in the government's submission in the District Court.","start":104.942,"stop":111.283,"duration":6.34},{"text":"Although respondent is the proponent of the motion, had the burden of proof on the issue of his privacy interest, he neither made a factual presentation of his own in the District Court nor contested the government's factual statement.","start":111.283,"stop":122.872,"duration":11.59},{"text":"In 1978, respondent solicited one George Mayberry Hunt to participate in a drug smuggling scheme.","start":122.872,"stop":131.557,"duration":8.68},{"text":"Pursuant to that plan, respondent was to purchase a boat that Hunt and his crew would use to transport marijuana from Colombia, South America, to respondent's ranch on the coast of northern California.","start":131.557,"stop":145.019,"duration":13.46},{"text":"After delivering the marijuana, Hunt and the crew were to take the boat

Otter.","start":150.471,"stop":155.171,"duration":4.7},{"text":"In the spring of 1979, respondent turned over the Sea Otter to a crew that had been recruited by Hunt.","start":155.171,"stop":163.2,"duration":8.03},{"text":"The crew sailed to Mexico to meet Hunt, and then on to Columbia to pick up the cargo of marijuana.","start":163.2,"stop":169.4,"duration":6.2},{"text":"The Sea Otter then returned to California and delivered the marijuana to respondent's ranch in June of 1979.","start":169.4,"stop":177.319,"duration":7.92},{"text":"Following delivery of the marijuana, Hunt and the crew started to sail the Sea Otter southward, but were delayed by bad weather.","start":177.319,"stop":184.69,"duration":7.37},{"text":"At that point, California fish and game officials boarded the Sea Otter because of suspected illegal fishing activities.","start":184.69,"stop":191.563,"duration":6.87},{"text":"The state officials saw things that led them to believe the Sea Otter had been engaged in marijuana smuggling, and they so notified the federal authorities.","start":191.563,"stop":200.325,"duration":8.76},{"text":"Coast Guard and Customs officers then went aboard the Sea Otter and found a number of suspicious circumstances, including admitted violations of Customs and Immigration requirements, a lack of documentation for the vessel, and evidence that two large rafts had recently been used, even though Hunt and the crew denied that they had been ashore.","start":200.325,"stop":220.083,"duration":19.76},{"text":"The Sea Otter was placed under seizure, and escorted to a nearby Coast Guard station where its cargo holds were pumped out and marijuana residue was found.","start":220.083,"stop":230.453,"duration":10.37},{"text":"No formal charges were brought against Hunt and the crew.","start":230.453,"stop":233.608,"duration":3.16},{"text":"Hunt remained in the San Francisco area for approximately nine months while the Sea Otter underwent repairs.","start":233.608,"stop":239.185,"duration":5.58},{"text":"He then took the boat to Costa Rica and used it for commercial fishing.","start":239.185,"stop":243.042,"duration":3.86},{"text":"Hunt turned over the Sea Otter to respondent in Costa Rica in November, 1981.","start":243.042,"stop":248.274,"duration":5.23},{"text":"Now, our submission here is straightforward.","start":248.274,"stop":251.165,"duration":2.89},{"text":"Respondent did not have an

Court.","start":310.843,"stop":314.029,"duration":3.19},{"text":"It was not preserved in the conditional guilty plea, and it was not submitted to or decided by the Court of

defendant's appeal will be limited to that one issue.","start":354.559,"stop":357.573,"duration":3.01},{"text":"As I say, we discussed all this in considerable detail in our reply brief, and we think

argument.","start":374.707,"stop":378.987,"duration":4.28},{"text":"A challenge to the seizure is certainly a different argument from a challenge to the search.","start":378.987,"stop":382.189,"duration":3.2},{"text":"The seizure argument was not raised or preserved below, either in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals, and we don't think it

interest, the Court of Appeals majority relied on four factors.","start":550.136,"stop":556.884,"duration":6.75},{"text":"However, those factors do not give rise to a privacy interest on respondent's part.","start":556.884,"stop":562.162,"duration":5.28},{"text":"The Court of Appeals first relied on respondent's ownership of the Sea Otter, but the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches protects personal privacy, not property rights, and this Court has made clear that ownership of the searched area or object does not as such create the requisite Fourth Amendment privacy interest.","start":562.162,"stop":583.701,"duration":21.54},{"text":"Bare title does not itself create an expectation of privacy.","start":583.701,"stop":588.73,"duration":5.03},{"text":"Now, this is

irrelevant.","start":588.73,"stop":600.149,"duration":11.42},{"text":"Ownership will often be associated with some use or occupancy or control of the property, including the exclusion of others that raises an expectation of privacy, but it is the expectation of privacy deriving from the use or control of the property and not the abstract fact of ownership as such that is the governing Fourth Amendment consideration.","start":600.149,"stop":622.81,"duration":22.66},{"text":"Where, as here, the property was never used by the owner, who bought it for the purpose of having other people use it, and had been turned over to the custody and control of others, the owner's paper title does not establish a privacy interest on his

case all that is far removed from the facts here, where the respondent did nothing.","start":725.006,"stop":731.565,"duration":6.56},{"text":"Let me also add that even if the owner had made some use of the property prior to turning it over to someone else, the duration of the relinquishment here would be such that we think he would have lost any privacy interest he might previously have had as the result of use, but our primary position here is that he never had any expectation of privacy in the first instance.","start":731.565,"stop":751.808,"duration":20.24},{"text":"Now, the second factor relied on by the Court of Appeals was respondent's possessory interest in the marijuana that was seized.","start":751.808,"stop":759.382,"duration":7.57},{"text":"This Court's decisions in Salvucci and in Rawlings unmistakably hold that a possessory interest in the items seized neither establish the necessary privacy interest in the areas searched nor serves as a substitute or a surrogate for that privacy interest.","start":759.382,"stop":777.546,"duration":18.16},{"text":"The Court of Appeals opinion confuses the analytically distinct concepts of an interference with a possessory interest in the seized items, which is the defining characteristic of a seizure, and the intrusion upon a privacy interest in the searched area which is the hallmark of a search.","start":777.546,"stop":794.899,"duration":17.35},{"text":"Now, once again, this is not to say that the fact that a person keeps his possessions in a place may not be relevant to whether he has an expectation of privacy.","start":794.899,"stop":803.271,"duration":8.37},{"text":"The use one makes of a place, including its use as a repository for personal effects, is one indication of a privacy interest, and thus a possessory interest in the items found can be evidential of a person's expectation of privacy because of the use he made of the searched area.","start":803.271,"stop":822.435,"duration":19.16},{"text":"But in this case it is clear the respondent never used the Sea Otter in a way that would in fact give rise to an expectation of privacy, and the Court of Appeals did not conclude otherwise.","start":822.435,"stop":833.352,"duration":10.92},{"text":"Rather, it relied on the simple fact that respondent had a possessory interest in the seized marijuana, and it is that approach that was legally erroneous.","start":833.352,"stop":842.521,"duration":9.17}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, how do

evidence.","start":875.523,"stop":884.551,"duration":9.03}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"--Because of items other than the drugs, you

to the contrary in Salvucci and in Rawlings.","start":927.548,"stop":931.61,"duration":4.06},{"text":"Now, I should also say that Salvucci disposes of the respondent's argument that he was entitled to challenge the search because he was in constructive possession of the Sea Otter and its cargo of marijuana.","start":931.61,"stop":945.994,"duration":14.38},{"text":"Salvucci, in overturning the automatic standing rule of Jones versus United States, held that a possessory interest sufficient to establish criminal liability under substantive criminal law principles is not equivalent to a privacy interest protected under the Fourth Amendment.","start":945.994,"stop":963.174,"duration":17.18},{"text":"The doctrine of constructive possession is probably the best example of the distinction recognized by the Court's analysis in Salvucci between criminal possession and Fourth Amendment privacy.","start":963.174,"stop":974.498,"duration":11.32},{"text":"Now, as a third factor, the Court of Appeals pointed to respondent's coventure status in the drug smuggling operation, but it is well settled by the decisions of this Court that a defendant cannot vicariously assert the Fourth Amendments rights of his confederates, and respondent concedes that proposition in his brief.","start":974.498,"stop":994.037,"duration":19.54},{"text":"Nor did respondent acquire any

respondent.","start":1013.296,"stop":1021.526,"duration":8.23},{"text":"And the Court of Appeals lastly considered the presence of water in the Sea Otter's hold which had to be pumped out in order to recover the marijuana debris to be a sign that steps had been taken to hide the marijuana and preserve privacy.","start":1021.526,"stop":1035.88,"duration":14.35},{"text":"This reasoning is flawed on several grounds.","start":1035.88,"stop":1040.253,"duration":4.37},{"text":"First, the fact that a criminal strived to conceal his acts from the authorities in the hopes that he will not get caught is scarcely the same thing as an expectation of privacy, let alone an expectation that society would recognize as reasonable and

interest.","start":3086.276,"stop":3099.879,"duration":13.6},{"text":"While it is undoubtedly true that contraband in plain view, such as in Texas versus Brown, gives right to no fault amendment claim, it is also clear that in Rawlings, for instance, the Court held that Rawlings' ownership of the contraband was plainly a factor to be considered on the expectation of privacy issue, and in Trupiano and specifically in Jeffers the government made an identical argument, the very same argument that they made here today, urging that because Title 21 at that time provided that no person shall have an interest in contraband, that meant that no person could raise a Fourth Amendment objection to the seizure of contraband.","start":3099.879,"stop":3139.722,"duration":39.84},{"text":"The

person who had a possessory interest which was not relinquished by his giving or entrusting the vessel to a joint venture, has standing, has a right to object to the seizure of the vessel because it infringed his possessory right, just as any tuna fleet owner in a similar circumstance could raise an objection to the seizure and pumping of the hold of his vessel, so, too, does Mr. Quinn.","start":3148.938,"stop":3179.721,"duration":30.78},{"text":"An analysis of the facts and this Court's holding in Bumper and Jeffers show also independently of the seizure issue that Mr. Quinn
