get.","start":317.187,"stop":323.122,"duration":5.94},{"text":"So what we think is determinative here is this no interest rule which applies specifically to suits against the Federal Government, the sovereign immunity rule.","start":323.122,"stop":333.648,"duration":10.53},{"text":"And this rule has been applied with undiminished force for the better part of 200 years.","start":333.648,"stop":338.786,"duration":5.14},{"text":"Early in the nineteenth century, it already was the usual practice of executive agencies not to pay interest on claims against the United States unless expressly directed to do so by Congress.","start":338.786,"stop":348.97,"duration":10.18},{"text":"And in the years since then, this Court has repeatedly applied the no interest rule to bar claims for interest against the United States in literally dozens of decisions.","start":348.97,"stop":360.841,"duration":11.87},{"text":"With the exception of narrow situations that are not applicable here, principally claims involving constitutional takings, the Court has applied the no interest rule to virtually every imaginable setting, in cases involving pre and post-judgment interest, cases involving liquidated claims and unliquidated claims, cases involving statutes and contracts.","start":360.841,"stop":379.91,"duration":19.07},{"text":"It has even applied the no interest rule without hesitation in cases in which the statutory language directed the United States to pay just compensation or full equitable relief, or other language that undoubtedly would make a private party liable for interest in the same circumstances.","start":379.91,"stop":394.827,"duration":14.92},{"text":"Given all this, the rule is considerably more than a simple canon of construction.","start":394.827,"stop":400.699,"duration":5.87},{"text":"As a principle that has been applied consistently by this Court and by the lower Courts and by executive agencies for well over a century, the rule has taken on an institutional significance as something that tells Congress what it must do when it thinks it appropriate to make interest available against the Federal Government.","start":400.699,"stop":416.505,"duration":15.81},{"text":"There is little doubt that Congress is aware of the rule and has legislated with the rule in mind.","start":416.505,"stop":421.254,"duration":4.75},{"text":"When it has wanted interest to be available against the United States, Congress has said so expressly, and it has set out the circumstances in which interest should be paid with great specificity, setting out the rates at which it should be paid, what a plaintiff must do to protect his right to collect, and generally the conditions under which interest will be awarded.","start":421.254,"stop":438.95,"duration":17.7},{"text":"It is against this background of consistent interpretation and action by the Court and by Congress that Respondent's claim for attorneys' fee under Title VII must be evaluated.","start":438.95,"stop":449.445,"duration":10.5},{"text":"The Court of Appeals itself acknowledged this background of law.","start":449.445,"stop":453.881,"duration":4.44},{"text":"It recognized that the no interest rule would be fully applicable here in the absence of a sufficiently clear waiver by Congress.","start":453.881,"stop":460.347,"duration":6.47},{"text":"But the Court of Appeals believed it found such a waiver in the Title VII attorneys' fee provision.","start":460.347,"stop":466.062,"duration":5.72},{"text":"That's 41 U.S.C. 2000(e)(5)(K), which authorizes a Court to award an attorneys' fee to the prevailing party in Title VII litigation as a part of the costs, and then goes on to provided that the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.","start":466.062,"stop":480.386,"duration":14.32},{"text":"In the Court of Appeals' view, this language, the \"same as a private person\" proviso, must have manifested Congress' clear intent to waive every aspect of the Government's sovereign immunity, necessarily including the no interest rule.","start":480.386,"stop":493.333,"duration":12.95},{"text":"But in our view there are several fundamental problems with this analysis.","start":493.333,"stop":498.487,"duration":5.15},{"text":"The first and most obvious involves what the Court believed the statutory language to mean, the \"same as a private person\" proviso.","start":498.487,"stop":506.531,"duration":8.04},{"text":"In fact, Congress placed that language in the statute not in an attempt to waive immunity in some complete way, but in 1964, at a time when the United States was not liable as a Title VII defendant at all.","start":506.531,"stop":518.979,"duration":12.45},{"text":"That language was put in the statute to provide that the United States would be liable for attorneys' fees in the same circumstances that private plaintiffs would be liable... excuse me... in which the United States acted as a plaintiff.","start":518.979,"stop":529.818,"duration":10.84},{"text":"As this Court, however, has held time and again in its no interest rule decisions, this sort of threshold undifferentiated waiver of sovereign immunity is simply not enough to make the United States liable for an award of interest.","start":529.818,"stop":545.64,"duration":15.82}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul

the basic attorneys' fees provision in Section 2000(e)(5)(K), that waives the Government's sovereign immunity and makes it liable for attorneys' fees awards at all to Title VII plaintiffs such as Respondent.","start":840.787,"stop":855.781,"duration":14.99},{"text":"The fact that Section 2000(e)(5)(K) already contains the \"same as a private person\" proviso upon which the Court of Appeals primarily relied is a fortuity that really has no application here.","start":855.781,"stop":866.59,"duration":10.81},{"text":"And that language certainly was not intended to waive the Government's

of Appeals' approach as viewed against the background of this no interest rule.","start":872.852,"stop":880.475,"duration":7.62},{"text":"Nothing in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, for

anything which is helpful to Respondent here, and that background sets out, as I think Attorney General Bell suggested in his memorandum, that Congress intended to remove sovereign immunity as a bar

employee plaintiffs as to their private sector counterparts.","start":915.178,"stop":944.869,"duration":29.69},{"text":"But again, as this Court has consistently held in cases interpreting the no
