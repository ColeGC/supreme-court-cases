Kneedler","textObjs":[{"text":"He applied the six year statute of limitations, but it's unclear whether the district court viewed the suit as a Tucker Act suit or whether it viewed it as arising under the allotment statute, Section 345 of Title 25, and the jurisdictional counterpart in Section 1353 of Title 28.","start":351.345,"stop":367.146,"duration":15.8},{"text":"It's our submission that the six year Statute of limitations would apply under either view of the suit.","start":367.146,"stop":373.847,"duration":6.7},{"text":"Of course, a suit under the allotment statute would go to the Eighth Circuit, unlike a Tucker Act appeal.","start":373.847,"stop":380.583,"duration":6.74},{"text":"Now, it's our submission that, even if viewed as in the nature of a Quiet Title Act suit under Section 345, that Section 345 was never intended, for reasons we have set forth at some length in our brief, to be a basis for a Quiet Title Act suit against the United States arising from the disposition of land after it was once allotted that Section 345, the allotment statute, applies only to disputes arising in the initial process of allotment.","start":380.583,"stop":408.383,"duration":27.8},{"text":"So it's our view that there was no at all for this sort of suit and that, even jurisdiction if there was, that the Quiet Title Act passed in 1972 has become the exclusive means for adjudication of disputes concerning the United States' title to property, as this Court held just several terms terms ago in Block versus North Dakota in a suit brought by a state.","start":408.383,"stop":430.386,"duration":22},{"text":"And lastly, as I mentioned, that even if this suit does arise under the allotment statute, there is no basis for exempting suits such as that from the six year statute of limitations in Section 2401 that the district court applied, and that in fact the Court of Appeals assumed was applicable, but announced a special rule under which it said that the statute of limitations did not actually run in this case.","start":430.386,"stop":454.411,"duration":24.02},{"text":"With respect to the approach that the Court of Appeals did take, its particular disposition of the statute of limitations issue was seriously flawed in our view.","start":454.411,"stop":468.34,"duration":13.93},{"text":"The court relied on this Court's 1922 decision, in Ewert versus Bluejacket, and in that case the Court held that a state statute of limitations does not apply of its own force to a suit, to an Indian land title claim.","start":468.34,"stop":483.681,"duration":15.34},{"text":"And the Court did not suggest in Ewert versus Bluejacket that if the state statute of limitations had applied that the period under that statute wouldn't even have commenced because the cause of action hadn't yet accrued.","start":483.681,"stop":497.689,"duration":14.01},{"text":"And therefore Ewert furnishes no basis for the special accrual rule that the Court of Appeals announced in this case, under which an explicit federal statute of limitations would be rendered inapplicable to a suit brought by an Indian whenever the suit is based on a transaction that is allegedly void.","start":497.689,"stop":516.793,"duration":19.1},{"text":"And a fortiori, we submit that Ewert doesn't support any such exception to a statute of limitations in a suit against the United States, which is a condition on the waiver of sovereign immunity and therefore goes to the jurisdiction of the court even to entertain the suit.","start":516.793,"stop":532.394,"duration":15.6},{"text":"And in fact, if Respondent were connect that the cause of action hasn't even accrued under such a rule, then she presumably has no right to even bring the action and the suit is premature.","start":532.394,"stop":544.331,"duration":11.94},{"text":"But of course, that's not her submission in this case.","start":544.331,"stop":546.592,"duration":2.26},{"text":"And I should also note that the Court of Appeals approach to the statute of limitations issue seriously undermines the nature of a statute of limitations.","start":546.592,"stop":559.031,"duration":12.44},{"text":"First, it would require, effectively require resolution of the merits of the dispute, in other woods whether the underlying transaction was void, in order to dispose of what should he the threshold question of whether the suit is barred by the statute of limitations.","start":559.031,"stop":572.709,"duration":13.68},{"text":"And beyond that, it has no connection to the purpose of a statute of limitations, which is to foster repose, irrespective of the merits of the underlying dispute, and to save the courts and the defendants from having to deal with cases in which the evidence might not be available because of loss of memory or loss of documents.","start":572.709,"stop":592.662,"duration":19.95},{"text":"In fact, the Court of Appeals acknowledged, but didn't give weight in this case to, the Government's submission that it would be difficult to piece together the records of transactions such as occurred here in the 1950's, many years after the fact.","start":592.662,"stop":606.921,"duration":14.26},{"text":"But aside from the particular defect of the Court of Appeals' decision, we thank that it was also wrong, as I have said, in not viewing this case as arising under the Quiet Title Act, because, as this Court said several terms ago, the Quiet Title Act is the exclusive means for challenging the United States' title to property.","start":606.921,"stop":627.914,"duration":20.99},{"text":"The Quiet Title Act contains its own statute of limitations, which provides that any civil action under that Act must be brought within 12 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued.","start":627.914,"stop":641.154,"duration":13.24},{"text":"And the Quiet Title Act specifies when a cause of action shall he deemed to have accrued, and that is within 12 years from the date on which the plaintiff either know or should have known of the claim of the United States to the land.","start":641.154,"stop":654.361,"duration":13.21},{"text":"In this case, the district court found, on the basis of Respondent's deposition, that she clearly knew of the sale of her land in 1954, and that the cause of action accrued, albeit for Section 2401 purposes, as of that date because she was put on notice of the United States' interest.","start":654.361,"stop":673.064,"duration":18.7},{"text":"Moreover, in this case Respondent expressed a desire to BIA in 1967 to sell all of her interests in allotments that she then held, and BIA furnished her with a list of those interests, but did not include any indication that she still owned an interest in the three allotments at issue in this case.","start":673.064,"stop":692.537,"duration":19.47},{"text":"And so therefore, when Respondent filed this suit in 1981 it was 27 years after the sales, of which the district court said she had knowledge, and 14 years after BIA had confirmed that she no longer held an interest in the three parcels that are at issue in this case.","start":692.537,"stop":708.518,"duration":15.98},{"text":"So for Quiet Title Act purposes, this suit is clearly barred by the statute of limitations in that Act.","start":708.518,"stop":715.884,"duration":7.37},{"text":"Furthermore, as this Court held in Block versus North Dakota, the statute of limitations applies to all claimants who seek to take advantage of the waiver of sovereign immunity under that statute.","start":715.884,"stop":728.283,"duration":12.4},{"text":"In Block, the Court applied that principle to bar suits brought by states, and the principles the Court applied we think apply equally here.","start":728.283,"stop":737.308,"duration":9.02},{"text":"First of all, the language of the statute of limitations refers to \"any civil action\" under the Quiet Title Act.","start":737.308,"stop":743.663,"duration":6.36},{"text":"There's no exception expressed for suits by Indians, just as there was not for suits by states.","start":743.663,"stop":750.386,"duration":6.72},{"text":"Beyond that, there's no suggestion in the legislative history of an implied exception that doesn't appear on the face of the Act for suits brought by Indians, just as there was not for suits brought by states.","start":750.386,"stop":762.124,"duration":11.74},{"text":"And in fact, as we have set out in our reply brief, there is acknowledgment of the possibility that suits would be brought by Indians against the United States under the Act, and yet Congress did not fashion a special statute of limitations for Indians.","start":762.124,"stop":775.893,"duration":13.77},{"text":"And finally, the purpose of the statute of limitations articulated by the Court in Block versus North Dakota was to serve the overriding rational purpose of preventing the national government against stale claims and claims based on evidence that might be difficult to assemble.","start":775.893,"stop":794.564,"duration":18.67},{"text":"And that policy was perceived by the Court to be one that requires uniform application in order to be effective, and we think that that applies equally to claims brought by Indians as to others.","start":794.564,"stop":806.303,"duration":11.74},{"text":"Now, Respondent has suggested in this case that the Quiet Title Act does not apply to this suit because of the provision in the second sentence of subsection (a) of the Quiet Title Act which states that it does not apply to trusts or restricted Indian lands.","start":806.303,"stop":824.855,"duration":18.55},{"text":"Respondent claims that these are trust or restricted Indian lands and therefore it falls outside the Act.","start":824.855,"stop":831.36,"duration":6.5},{"text":"But of course, that assertion begs the very question that would have to be decided on the merits if the case was not barred by the statute of limitations.","start":831.36,"stop":841.788,"duration":10.43},{"text":"And if Respondent were correct, that would mean that the waiver of sovereign immunity that Congress has afforded to all other claimants would not apply to Indians who want to bring claims against the United States claiming that land that the United States claims title to in fact should be deemed to be held in the interest of the Indians.","start":841.788,"stop":859.8,"duration":18.01},{"text":"And Respondent hasn't suggested any reason why Congress would have wanted to exclude Indians from the benefit of that waiver of sovereign immunity that was afforded to all other claimants.","start":859.8,"stop":869.798,"duration":10},{"text":"And in fact, the text and legislative history of the Act demonstrates that Congress did not intend that.","start":869.798,"stop":874.7,"duration":4.9},{"text":"Whether the exception under the Quiet Title Act applies for trust and restricted lands depends on the nature of the interest the United States claims in the land, not the interest that the plaintiff thinks the United States should claim.","start":874.7,"stop":889.1,"duration":14.4},{"text":"And in this case it's clear that the United States holds the land for the Forest Service, not in a capacity as trustee for the Indians.","start":889.1,"stop":898.585,"duration":9.49},{"text":"And this view of the application of the exception is confirmed by the general consent to suit in the Quiet Title Act itself, which grants consent to resolve disputed title questions to land in which the United States claims an interest.","start":898.585,"stop":912.914,"duration":14.33},{"text":"It's not dependent upon what it's interest actually is.","start":912.914,"stop":917.088,"duration":4.17},{"text":"Beyond that, if the United States disclaims an interest the Quiet Title Act does not even apply.","start":917.088,"stop":923.272,"duration":6.18},{"text":"And the legislative history, beyond that, indicates to the same effect, that the exception for Indian lands was intended to apply to situations where land is \"held in trust for Indians\", and in this case the United States is not purporting to hold the land in trust for Indians.","start":923.272,"stop":944.907,"duration":21.63},{"text":"The purpose was to prevent Indian lands from being subject to suit and challenge by third parties where the United States and the Indians are in agreement about the Indians' interest in the lands.","start":944.907,"stop":958.465,"duration":13.56},{"text":"It wasn't to prevent resolution of disputes between the Indians and the United States.","start":958.465,"stop":963.208,"duration":4.74},{"text":"And finally, as we pointed out in our reply brief, a provision of the Quiet Title Act in an early draft of it was deleted that would have excluded suits involving lands to which Indians or Native Americans claimed an interest based on aboriginal title.","start":963.208,"stop":980.868,"duration":17.66},{"text":"And one of the objections that the Justice Department raised to that was that it might preclude suits brought by Indians against the United States where there was an interest claimed.","start":980.868,"stop":991.036,"duration":10.17},{"text":"And the provision was deleted from the bill, and we believe that confirms that suits brought by Indians are not intended to be excluded.","start":991.036,"stop":999.661,"duration":8.63},{"text":"Now, with respect to the Tucker Act, if this suit does arise under the Tucker Act there is, of course, the jurisdictional question mentioned, but it would be barred by the statute of limitations under 2401(a) in any event.","start":999.661,"stop":1022.816,"duration":23.16},{"text":"That statute of limitations applies to every civil action commenced against the United States.","start":1022.816,"stop":1029.121,"duration":6.31},{"text":"There's only one exception to that, and that's for a person who is under a legal disability; and the existence of that one exception indicates that Congress has foreclosed other sorts of exceptions.","start":1029.121,"stop":1041.75,"duration":12.63},{"text":"This same principle applies when one considers the application of Section 2401(a) to a suit under the allotment statute, Section 345, if in fact that statute were thought to apply here.","start":1041.75,"stop":1054.179,"duration":12.43},{"text":"Congress has made the statute applicable to all civil actions, has created one exception for persons under a legal disability, but has not included any exception for suits brought by Indians.","start":1054.179,"stop":1067.495,"duration":13.32},{"text":"Now, it has been suggested that there is a limitation to the statute of limitations for situations in which property is held in an express trust.","start":1067.495,"stop":1083.747,"duration":16.25},{"text":"Now, precisely what Respondent means by that isn't clear, and it's not clear that any such concept was intended to be incorporated into the statute of limitations is Section 2401.","start":1083.747,"stop":1097.515,"duration":13.77},{"text":"However, the Court of Claims, in construing the parallel statute of limitations under Section 2501 of Title 28, has recognized that in a situation where the United States actually holds money in a treasury account and doesn't dispute that it belongs to a particular party, a particular Indian, let's say, in a treasury account, and that the money is already existing, no statute of limitations applies to require the claimant to request that money or sue for it within a particular period of time.","start":1097.515,"stop":1127.386,"duration":29.87},{"text":"But that's because the United States in those situations is not disputing that the land... that the money belongs to the Indian and that it's available whenever he requests it.","start":1127.386,"stop":1136.281,"duration":8.89},{"text":"However, if the claimant requested the money and the United States denied that it belonged to the Indian in this case, then that would be a situation where there was a repudiation of an express trust.","start":1136.281,"stop":1149.068,"duration":12.79},{"text":"And even under the rule that the Respondent has advanced in this case, the statute of limitations would begin to run.","start":1149.068,"stop":1156.374,"duration":7.31},{"text":"That rule is reflected in the cases upon which Respondent relies and the other cases that we set forth in our reply brief discussing this express trust concept.","start":1156.374,"stop":1165.3,"duration":8.93},{"text":"So in this case, even if what this Court referred to as the bare trust under Section 5 of the allotment act is the equivalent of an express trust for purposes of application of the rule that Repondent relies upon, in 1954 when the land was sold out of its trust status by the United States there couldn't have been a clearer repudiation of any trust relationship between the United States and Respondent with respect to that land.","start":1165.3,"stop":1194.749,"duration":29.45},{"text":"And even under the rule Respondent suggests, that would trigger the running of the statute of limitations at that time.","start":1194.749,"stop":1202.045,"duration":7.3},{"text":"And whether the statute of limitations is six years or 12 years, that period would have long since expired by the time this suit was
