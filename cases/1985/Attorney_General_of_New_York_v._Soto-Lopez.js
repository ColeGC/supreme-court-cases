rational basis standard so that any basis which can be put forward to rationally justify the statute should be sufficient to sustain its validity.","start":360.184,"stop":372.757,"duration":12.57},{"text":"In the initial... in the August against Bronstein decision, the Court found that these were the four purposes which were served, and relying on the opinion of Chief Judge Friendly in a case called Russell against Hodges we believe that the states do have a role as states in encouraging service of their residents in the military, and that the Constitution does give the states the role as such in providing for national defense, and we looked at two things specifically.","start":372.757,"stop":404.629,"duration":31.87},{"text":"Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the authority to raise militias according to the discipline prescribed by Congress is reserved to the states, and Clause 15 explicitly reserves to the states, and I am quoting,","start":404.629,"stop":416.77,"duration":12.14},{"text":"\"the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia. \"","start":416.77,"stop":420.472,"duration":3.7},{"text":"And similarly, the Second Amendment to the Constitution recognizes that a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state, and under the Constitution, Congress is empowered to call up and historically has often called up the militia, the State National Guard, in time of war to provide for the common defense, and indeed at this time many of the nation's combat-ready units are included in the state militias.","start":420.472,"stop":444.671,"duration":24.2},{"text":"Thus, we believe the state as a state, under our Constitution, has an interest in encouraging its residents to serve in the military.","start":444.671,"stop":452.092,"duration":7.42},{"text":"Similarly, during or just before a time of war, a military draft becomes a greater probability than would otherwise be the case, and of course much more important than would otherwise be the case.","start":452.092,"stop":465.15,"duration":13.06},{"text":"Under our draft laws, quotas are set for each state based on the number of eligible persons in that state and based on the number of eligible persons nationwide, and a state under the Selective Service laws gets credit for the number of persons currently in the service.","start":465.15,"stop":481.861,"duration":16.71},{"text":"Thus, we believe that the state may validly seek to encourage volunteer service both in order to assist the nation and to assist the state in meeting its quotas under the national defense system, and similarly may seek to minimize the burden on non-volunteers who may be providing important services to the state or to the people of the state.","start":481.861,"stop":502.608,"duration":20.75},{"text":"It seems to us that a critical error in the Second Circuit's opinion is to assume that because New York might have an interest in encouraging service of all residents of the United States in the service, that therefore it is illegitimate for New York to concentrate its efforts on its lesser included interest, namely, encouraging its own residents to serve.","start":502.608,"stop":524.954,"duration":22.35},{"text":"No doctrine of which we are aware holds that a state offering prospective incentives for participation in a national program such as the draft must make those promised benefits available to all persons residing outside their borders, and as a practical matter, New York law targets the residents of the State of New York, simply because it is not much of an incentive to enter into the military service for a teen-ager in Nevada, to be offered public service employment in New York after service in wartime.","start":524.954,"stop":558.861,"duration":33.91},{"text":"The New York law also compensates veterans, as Justice Rehnquist indicated, and compensation is certainly one of its most important purposes.","start":558.861,"stop":569.3,"duration":10.44},{"text":"Again, the Second Circuit viewed that purpose purely retrospectively, failing to recognize, we submit, that promise of compensation is so important incentive to military service.","start":569.3,"stop":580.208,"duration":10.91},{"text":"Even if one were to concede that rewarding veterans after the fact for military service at some point in the past is not a legitimate state purpose, it does not follow, it seems to us, that promising to reward them in the future for such military service doesn't serve a legitimate state purpose.","start":580.208,"stop":597.819,"duration":17.61},{"text":"That purpose, we submit again, is encouraging service in the military.","start":597.819,"stop":602.204,"duration":4.38},{"text":"An additional important purpose that the New York law and the New York constitutional provisions are intended to fulfill is to encourage skilled veterans to come home and to serve in the public service.","start":602.204,"stop":613.929,"duration":11.73},{"text":"A wartime veteran, as I am sure this Court is aware, acquires skills and experiences which make that person a very desirable employee, whether for government or for anybody else, and we would of course concede that that is true of all veterans, whether they reside... whether they have ever resided in New York or not.","start":613.929,"stop":632.058,"duration":18.13},{"text":"Nonetheless, we believe that New York has a valid interest, unrelated to any desire to reward its own people, to encourage former residents to come back to New York after time of war and to engage in public service.","start":632.058,"stop":643.681,"duration":11.62},{"text":"I think it's important to focus on the group that New York is targeting with this provision, entirely apart from the questions, that the incentive purpose of going into the military for the person who is drafted, for example.","start":643.681,"stop":660.31,"duration":16.63},{"text":"The group New York has always targeted with the statue is the group which is by definition is uprooted, New York residents who have gone to war.","start":660.31,"stop":668.099,"duration":7.79},{"text":"Whether or not they have done so, again in reliance on the promise of preferential consideration at a later point, it is reasonable for the State to give them some encouragement to return home and New York, beyond that, is interested not only in getting residents to return home but to engage in public service when they do so, and this Court has frequently indicated that a state's interest in maximizing the quality of its public work force is an important one which may justify restrictions that otherwise might be constitutionally doubtful.","start":668.099,"stop":700.987,"duration":32.89},{"text":"Quite arguably, based on this Court's decisions, New York could not constitutionally make such distinctions after the fact.","start":700.987,"stop":708.474,"duration":7.49},{"text":"An example is that New York could not declare in 1946 that state residents... that persons who had gone to college in New York State in 1961 would receive tuition assistance grants, because that would discriminate against persons who had become residents of the State of New York subsequent to 1981.","start":708.474,"stop":729.221,"duration":20.75},{"text":"But we submit there is no doubt that prospectively in 1981, New York could have adopted tuition support grants to persons who were residents in the state at that time, as this Court's decisions is that area have made clear.","start":729.221,"stop":742.314,"duration":13.09},{"text":"We certainly concede that New York could have drafted this statute and could have framed its constitutional provisions in such a way as to more closely and more precisely retained its objectives, and perhaps the plaintiffs in this case in fact are as well qualified as some other people who received a preference under New York statute.","start":742.314,"stop":767.762,"duration":25.45},{"text":"But the distinction New York makes, we submit, is a rational one in view of the critical incentive purposes.","start":767.762,"stop":773.233,"duration":5.47},{"text":"New York's constitutional provision does encourage service both in the military and in civil service employment, and those are legitimate objectives and this Court has frequently said that--","start":773.233,"stop":783.241,"duration":10.01}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"Is there anything in the record to support that statement, the statement that it does increase the

correct.","start":800.835,"stop":802.402,"duration":1.57},{"text":"It is an incentive purpose that has historically been given for the statute, and whether... we don't know whether this constitutional provision encourages one or 100 people to do that, but I think it can clearly be said to do that in some number of cases.","start":802.402,"stop":825.535,"duration":23.13},{"text":"To return for a moment to the Zobel and Hooper decisions, both the Alaska dividend statute and the New Mexico property tax exemption, which were invalidated by this Court, were after the fact enactments designed to
