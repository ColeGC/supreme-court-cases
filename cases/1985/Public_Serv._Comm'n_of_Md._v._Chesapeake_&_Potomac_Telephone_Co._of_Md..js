Emge","textObjs":[{"text":"The district court order in our case indicates that if the Fourth Circuit decision is reversed that the judgment would be entered in favor of the defendants in that case, which is the Maryland commission.","start":144.598,"stop":156.204,"duration":11.61},{"text":"However, there are numerous cases involving other matters than the preemption order under Section 401 enforcement proceedings that have just recently been instituted, and since there is a conflict between the First and the Fourth Circuits on whether a private party can enforce the preemption... an FCC rulemaking order... there will be other instances where the decision will depend upon which circuit you're in.","start":156.204,"stop":184.613,"duration":28.41},{"text":"So although the commission's decision... the commission as a defendant will have a judgment in its favor in the event the preceding case is ruled in favor of the states, there are still conflicts that will remain that will arise in other areas.","start":184.613,"stop":202.232,"duration":17.62},{"text":"If the Court agrees that the preemption order is not the type of FCC decision that can be enforced by a private party, it would be unnecessary to address or reach the broader question as to whether a state commission is a person and to what extent the state commission is a person for purposes of the Communications Act.","start":202.232,"stop":226.237,"duration":24},{"text":"Under the enforcement scheme established by Congress in Section 401, the FCC has the sole authority to enforce compliance with provisions of the Act, and it's important to note at this point that in the preemption order the FCC based its decision on the fact that it said that Section of the Communications Act preempted inconsistent state depreciation practices.","start":226.237,"stop":254.974,"duration":28.74},{"text":"Clearly, enforcement of the preemption order is nothing more than enforcing compliance with the Act, and under the enforcement scheme established by Congress is Section 401 the <FCC> [= FCC] and not private parties has the sole authority to determine when and if those violations, such violations, should be enforced.","start":254.974,"stop":276.592,"duration":21.62},{"text":"Under the enforcement scheme in Section 401, private parties can only enforce obedience to FCC orders.","start":276.592,"stop":285.167,"duration":8.57},{"text":"It is clear that by limiting enforcement under Section 401(b) to orders, Congress clearly understood that there were other types of FCC actions that would not be enforceably by private parties under that subsection.","start":285.167,"stop":299.566,"duration":14.4},{"text":"It's clear that there was a distinction, well known distinction, between what constitutes an agency order and what constitutes a rule.","start":299.566,"stop":309.266,"duration":9.7},{"text":"Congress chose to use the word \"order\" with respect to the type of actions that could be enforced by a private party.","start":309.266,"stop":315.748,"duration":6.48},{"text":"In addition, if Congress had intended private parties to be able to enforce FCC rules, which are the functional equivalent of statutes, the provisions of Section 401(a) would have no meaning.","start":315.748,"stop":330.852,"duration":15.1},{"text":"The sole responsibility, once again, for enforcing the compliance with the Act resides only in the FCC.","start":330.852,"stop":339.817,"duration":8.97},{"text":"The Respondents and their supporting amici curiae concede that not all FCC actions are enforceable under Section 401(b).","start":339.817,"stop":349.843,"duration":10.03},{"text":"For example, the Respondent implies in its brief that regulations and rules which are sufficiently general in their terms and applicability may not be enforceable by private parties under Section 401(b).","start":349.843,"stop":364.244,"duration":14.4},{"text":"They merely say... allege in this case that the Court doesn't have to reach that because of their position that the preemption order is not one of those orders.","start":364.244,"stop":373.459,"duration":9.21},{"text":"But we submit that if you review the terms and provisions of the preemption order, it clearly is a rule of general applicability and is addressed to a broad group of entities.","start":373.459,"stop":386.344,"duration":12.88},{"text":"They seem to indicate, the Respondents that is, that there is a hybrid action called a rulemaking order, and that rulemaking orders such as the preemption order can be enforced by private parties under Section 401(b).","start":386.344,"stop":403.649,"duration":17.31},{"text":"The first point to be made with respect to that argument is that the fact that the FCC calls the action an order is under this Court's decision in CBS not determinative.","start":403.649,"stop":416.458,"duration":12.81},{"text":"It's the substance of what the FCC has done, rather than what it classifies its actions to be, that controls.","start":416.458,"stop":423.017,"duration":6.56},{"text":"Secondly, if the FCC adopted a rule by an order, it's clear that if that action were to be enforced, it would not be the order adopting the rule that would be enforced, it would be the substance of the rule that would be enforced by the court.","start":423.017,"stop":439.948,"duration":16.93},{"text":"So therefore you once again get back to the situation where, although the FCC has the sole responsibility to adopt... to enforce provisions of the Communications Act, a private party under the enforcement scheme suggested by the Respondents would also share that responsibility.","start":439.948,"stop":458.519,"duration":18.57},{"text":"In order to preserve the enforcement scheme that was established by Congress in Section 401 and thereby maintain the role assigned to the FCC by the Act, enforcement under Section 401(b) must be limited to FCC orders which determine the specific rights and responsibilities of specific individual parties and are based upon findings which take into account specific facts associated with that situation.","start":458.519,"stop":494.629,"duration":36.11},{"text":"These orders, in short, must be specific in their requirements and self-executing.","start":494.629,"stop":500.984,"duration":6.35},{"text":"By self-executing, we mean that in order for a court to enforce the FCC order there is no further determination required by the Federal Communications Commission, for, as the FCC has noted in its brief, under the enforcement scheme established by Congress in Section 401(b), the court's role in the enforcement of FCC orders is very limited.","start":500.984,"stop":528.272,"duration":27.29},{"text":"So in order for the federal court's role to be limited, the order that is sought to be enforced must be very specific in what it requires, it must be directed to a specific party, and must be based upon specific facts that were presented to the agency, not a general pronouncement of policy, agency policy.","start":528.272,"stop":547.95,"duration":19.68},{"text":"The preemption order is clearly not a self-executing FCC order, but rather is a broad policy statement containing agency interpretation of its statutory authority, and it prescribes conduct that's applicable to a broad class of individuals.","start":547.95,"stop":568.317,"duration":20.37},{"text":"It is a quasi-legislative action, which is the functional equivalent of the Communications Act.","start":568.317,"stop":574.44,"duration":6.12},{"text":"And once again to point out that the FCC's decision in the preemption order was based upon the fact that it found that the Communications Act, Section 220, preempted the states from using inconsistent practices, and that the enforcement of that preemption order is no different from enforcing compliance with that section of the Communications Act.","start":574.44,"stop":598.133,"duration":23.69},{"text":"There are numerous policy considerations which underlie the enforcement scheme that was adopted by Congress and which is set forth in Section 401, and the consideration of these policies indicates that private enforcement of the preemption order is precluded.","start":598.133,"stop":617.798,"duration":19.66},{"text":"For example, if the goal of promoting the development of uniform, nationwide interstate policy permits the FCC to preempt inconsistent state depreciation practices, then that policy also dictates that the FCC and not private parties enforce the preemption order under Section 401(b).","start":617.798,"stop":641.632,"duration":23.83},{"text":"You cannot have uniformity absent the FCC determination that a state ratemaking order is in violation of the preemption order.","start":641.632,"stop":652.83,"duration":11.2},{"text":"The cases that have arisen in Maine, in the district courts of Maine, Louisiana, and Kentucky, illustrate that the federal courts in order to enforce the preemption order are required to make a detailed analysis, conduct judicial review of a state ratemaking order to determine if that state's order complies with the FCC preemption order.","start":652.83,"stop":675.555,"duration":22.72},{"text":"In determining... and reviewing a state rate order involves a substantial amount of judgment to be exercised by the reviewing court, and will result in contrary decisions, inconsistent decisions, in privately instituted enforcement cases.","start":675.555,"stop":698.687,"duration":23.13},{"text":"The cases that have arisen illustrate clearly that, absent FCC enforcement of the preemption order, there will be inconsistent implementation of that policy embodied in that preemption order.","start":698.687,"stop":713.743,"duration":15.06},{"text":"The FCC has argued that the availability of that agency to participate in district court proceedings is sufficient to ensure that uniformity will be maintained.","start":713.743,"stop":727.237,"duration":13.49},{"text":"However, it's obvious that the FCC may not participate in each and every case that's instituted under Section 401(b).","start":727.237,"stop":737.593,"duration":10.36},{"text":"It may not be invited by the parties or by the district court to make its views known.","start":737.593,"stop":743.372,"duration":5.78},{"text":"Consequently, the action of the district court may in fact be contrary to the policies that the FCC has articulated.","start":743.372,"stop":751.43,"duration":8.06},{"text":"But more importantly, it deprives the FCC of its opportunity to choose the cases that it believes should be enforced and leaves that decision in the hands of private parties.","start":751.43,"stop":766.143,"duration":14.71},{"text":"A specific case that's instituted by a private party following private interests, rather than
