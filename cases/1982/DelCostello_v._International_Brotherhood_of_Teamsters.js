1977.","start":94.147,"stop":110.747,"duration":16.6},{"text":"At that time he was also a dissident member of PROD, a national Teamsters organization and was engaged in a campaign of truck safety

amicably.","start":143.842,"stop":151.965,"duration":8.12},{"text":"As a result, the grievance took the form of a hearing before a committee consisting of an equal number of employer and union

December of 1977.","start":230.825,"stop":249.004,"duration":18.18},{"text":"Several months thereafter, I believe it was in March of 1978, Mr. Del Costello initiated suit in the federal district court

disputes.","start":281.537,"stop":292.003,"duration":10.47},{"text":"In any event, for the next 32 months during which time the parties engaged in rather extensive discovery, not one time did Anchor

Mitchell.","start":292.003,"stop":320.661,"duration":28.66},{"text":"We contend that if this Court applies the arbitral limitation statute of 30 days for all intents and purposes the hybrid cause of action is destroyed.","start":320.661,"stop":337.749,"duration":17.09},{"text":"I say that because most of these arbitration statutes were initially passed by the state legislatures to apply to commercial disputes and in commercial disputes from the arbitrator to the courts the parties are usually represented by the same counsel.","start":337.749,"stop":361.005,"duration":23.26},{"text":"And

day.","start":361.005,"stop":376.279,"duration":15.27},{"text":"The situation is entirely different with a disconnected party such as Mr. Del Costello or anyone having hybrid cause of action because

his union representative.","start":390.322,"stop":397.977,"duration":7.65},{"text":"Moreover, unlike the arbitral proceeding where there is an established and known record of law and fact, the facts surrounding the malpractice not only are not on the record but the business agent in most instances does everything to hide those facts.","start":397.977,"stop":417.685,"duration":19.71},{"text":"As a consequence, before the worker ever realizes that he has a cause of action, 30 days has already passed and he is out of court.","start":417.685,"stop":428.557,"duration":10.87},{"text":"But that is
