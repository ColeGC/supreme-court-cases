Congress in the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 meant that natural gas produced by a pipeline is automatically entitled to the incentive pricing scheme under Title I of that Act.","start":17.821,"stop":36.923,"duration":19.1},{"text":"Even though, as here, the gas is old gas long dedicated to the interstate market.","start":36.923,"stop":43.28,"duration":6.36},{"text":"In our view, the Court in holding that the first sale prices and that the pricing scheme of Title I applied to this pipeline produced gas misconceived the legislative intent and argued, granted a profit to which the pipeline were not entitled, $200 million prospectively and something over $2 billion total projected.","start":43.28,"stop":66.801,"duration":23.52},{"text":"These are complex matters under a complicated statutory scheme.","start":66.801,"stop":71.768,"duration":4.97},{"text":"And I think it would be helpful as I use these words to indicate we're talking about wellhead or field sales, mixed systems supply, commingling, downstream.","start":71.768,"stop":84.279,"duration":12.51},{"text":"I think those terms are essential to the decision making in this case and they also have functional meaning in the history of pipeline regulation.","start":84.279,"stop":91.947,"duration":7.67},{"text":"A pipeline gets its gas from many wells.","start":91.947,"stop":96.103,"duration":4.16},{"text":"It can be, I guess, compared to a tree with roots.","start":96.103,"stop":100.242,"duration":4.14},{"text":"Most of these wells are operated by independent producers.","start":100.242,"stop":104.208,"duration":3.97},{"text":"Some are pipeline produced wells.","start":104.208,"stop":107.472,"duration":3.26},{"text":"Normally, in

supply.","start":107.472,"stop":121.904,"duration":14.43},{"text":"And they go downstream to the pipelines'... generally to the pipelines' regular system customers.","start":121.904,"stop":129.121,"duration":7.22},{"text":"A pipeline also, however, produces its own gas which it sells at the wellhead, principally to other pipelines, sometimes to other third parties.","start":129.121,"stop":142.178,"duration":13.06},{"text":"In this sense... and that's part of, essential of our argument... it functions like an independent producer.","start":142.178,"stop":148.784,"duration":6.61},{"text":"These differences have very important regulatory considerations in the historical background.","start":148.784,"stop":157.483,"duration":8.7},{"text":"First, very early in the application of the Natural Gas Act which was enacted in 1938, pipeline produced gas was deemed to be like other gas the pipeline transported in interstate commerce.","start":157.483,"stop":173.243,"duration":15.76},{"text":"It was deemed to be part of the entire wholesale transaction.","start":173.243,"stop":178.631,"duration":5.39},{"text":"Colorado Interstate, a decision of this Court, made that clear.","start":178.631,"stop":182.178,"duration":3.55},{"text":"And it was subject to the cost-of-service methodology which, as the Court knows, places the initial risk on the consumer.","start":182.178,"stop":192.594,"duration":10.42},{"text":"The gas of that nature is the gas involved here, where the risk, as I say, is the consumer risk.","start":192.594,"stop":202.34,"duration":9.75},{"text":"On the other hand, as the Court will recall, it was not until 1954, when the Phillips case was decided, that the independent producer was deemed to be a natural gas company covered by the Act, by the Natural Gas Act.","start":202.34,"stop":221.365,"duration":19.03},{"text":"As this Court recognized in Permian, the early years proved to be a time of very difficulty in any effort to regulate.","start":221.365,"stop":229.376,"duration":8.01},{"text":"They didn't... they weren't natural gas companies in the traditional sense.","start":229.376,"stop":232.984,"duration":3.61},{"text":"They didn't transport in interstate commerce.","start":232.984,"stop":236.7,"duration":3.72},{"text":"And individual cost-of-service regulation failed, as Permian points out.","start":236.7,"stop":242.354,"duration":5.65},{"text":"The Commission then turned to a different way of regulating independent producers.","start":242.354,"stop":247.697,"duration":5.34},{"text":"The regulation consisted of average industry costs based upon area and then national rates.","start":247.697,"stop":255.475,"duration":7.78},{"text":"This was essentially an incentive type pricing.","start":255.475,"stop":259.817,"duration":4.34},{"text":"For example, the risk was on the investor.","start":259.817,"stop":263.253,"duration":3.44},{"text":"If an independent producer produced only dry holes, he got no recovery.","start":263.253,"stop":268.469,"duration":5.22},{"text":"If, on the other hand, he operated on less than average costs, dug a well which produced, then he was able to make a profit so that there was that investor risk approach.","start":268.469,"stop":281.589,"duration":13.12},{"text":"Most pertinently as this development occurred, the affiliate of the pipeline, the affiliate of the pipeline, the producing affiliate of the pipeline was accorded the same treatment.","start":281.589,"stop":293.569,"duration":11.98},{"text":"More to the point here the pipeline who sold at the wellhead was given this economic risk establishment, was also treated as an independent producer would be, that you have that kind of development.","start":293.569,"stop":311.624,"duration":18.06},{"text":"At the same time, as the years went on, starting in '69 when there was an indication of a gas shortage, the commission decided to give not cost based gas... all of that pre-'69 cost based gas was on cost-of-service... but mixed system supplied from a pipeline to be on parity, giving parity pricing to the independent producer, wellhead pricing, and to the pipeline, pricing of its wellhead sales.","start":311.624,"stop":344.033,"duration":32.41},{"text":"But cost-of-service remained on cost-of-service.","start":344.033,"stop":348.373,"duration":4.34},{"text":"As a matter of fact in the '70's, in the early '70's, the pipelines essentially either through agreements or through their own choice by saying we'd rather be on... we'd rather be on cost-of-service with... it serves our purposes better.","start":348.373,"stop":365.806,"duration":17.43},{"text":"These special circumstance pipelines were allowed to be on cost-of-service.","start":365.806,"stop":369.913,"duration":4.11},{"text":"Other pipelines as to this mixed system supply chose instead to get the area and national rates.","start":369.913,"stop":378.878,"duration":8.96},{"text":"So you have at the time of the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act, that development coupled with the development that the result of the decision in the Phillips case had lead to an interstate regulated market and an intrastate unregulated market with regard to independent producer sales or sales like independent producers.","start":378.878,"stop":404.836,"duration":25.96},{"text":"The consequence was that the market bifurcated.","start":404.836,"stop":408.631,"duration":3.79},{"text":"The independent producer certainly, in shopping the market place as to his new wells, would prefer to sell it in the intrastate market, which he did... or which the producers generally did.","start":408.631,"stop":419.706,"duration":11.08},{"text":"The consequences were there was less gas in the interstate market, more gas in the intrastate market, and high priced gas.","start":419.706,"stop":428.781,"duration":9.07},{"text":"This was the bifurcation coupled with the fact that at that time the shortages commenced.","start":428.781,"stop":434.482,"duration":5.7},{"text":"Now I would like, with that background, to turn to the statutory language.","start":434.482,"stop":440.62,"duration":6.14},{"text":"Statutory language is set forth at page 2 of our main brief, or in the Appendix at E(1).","start":440.62,"stop":448.977,"duration":8.36},{"text":"As the Court will note, the first portion of that statute, Section 2(21), was a definitional

I think this is essential to point to the Court... that it shall not include the sale of any volume of natural gas by any interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company, or any affiliate thereof... and now the critical language... unless such sale is attributable to volumes of natural gas produced by the pipeline, the interstate pipeline, or the local distribution company, or the affiliate.","start":485.79,"stop":517.245,"duration":31.45},{"text":"The Court of Appeals said, well, while there is no sale we must set up if there's a intra-corporate transaction.","start":517.245,"stop":526.398,"duration":9.15},{"text":"When the production division of a pipeline transfers the gas to the transportation division of the pipeline there is a hypothecated first sale.","start":526.398,"stop":538.564,"duration":12.17},{"text":"Therefore the higher pricing provisions of the Title I of the Natural Gas Policy Act would apply.","start":538.564,"stop":545.86,"duration":7.3},{"text":"We think that this interpretation flies in the face of the statute.","start":545.86,"stop":550.014,"duration":4.15},{"text":"Section 2(20), which is also printed at page 2 of our brief, makes it clear that the term \"sale\" means a transfer for value.","start":550.014,"stop":560.057,"duration":10.04},{"text":"There is no transfer for value in the context of the Court of Appeals analysis.","start":560.057,"stop":565.976,"duration":5.92},{"text":"More significantly, or equally significantly, there's no contract.","start":565.976,"stop":570.63,"duration":4.65},{"text":"There's no relationship which traditionally has been the basis of regulation by this commission... by the FERC... under the Natural Gas Act.","start":570.63,"stop":579.939,"duration":9.31},{"text":"The Mobil Sierra doctrine, as this Court will recall, makes it clear that the contract to the parties are the basis for the relationship.","start":579.939,"stop":588.061,"duration":8.12},{"text":"The same principle attaches quite clearly under the Natural Gas Policy Act.","start":588.061,"stop":595.183,"duration":7.12},{"text":"As this Court's decision the other day at agency... in energy reserves makes clear, the critical consideration is, you don't get the contract, you don't get the statutory price, you get the contract price or whichever is lower.","start":595.183,"stop":610.427,"duration":15.24},{"text":"So it seems to me that the initial interpretation by the Court of Appeals cannot withstand the statutory language.","start":610.427,"stop":619.642,"duration":9.22},{"text":"There's another interpretation which the Court of Appeals rejected, but which is made by several of the petitioners.","start":619.642,"stop":625.624,"duration":5.98}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Before you leave that interpretation, am I correct in recalling that if the pipeline had a subsidiary instead of a single corporate entity that transferred from its wholly-owned production subsidiary to its transmission subsidiary, that you would regard that as a sale?","start":625.624,"stop":641.883,"duration":16.26}]},{"speakerName":"Jerome M.
