yelling and screaming and Sergeant Mitzner then placed him under arrest, did not search him at that time, handcuffed him, took him to his car, and brought him to the police station.","start":407.433,"stop":425.736,"duration":18.3},{"text":"At the police station the Respondent was unhandcuffed and taken into the booking room where the standard police booking procedure began.","start":425.736,"stop":437.778,"duration":12.04},{"text":"The Respondent was told to remove his clothing, to put on jail garb, to take the things out of his pockets, and he began filling out forms.","start":437.778,"stop":448.338,"duration":10.56},{"text":"Then, according to Sergeant Mitzner, the Petitioner or the Respondent placed his purse on the counter before him, took out a pack of cigarettes.","start":448.338,"stop":458.911,"duration":10.57},{"text":"The sergeant touched that purse, felt something inside and reached in.","start":458.911,"stop":465.377,"duration":6.47},{"text":"According to the Petitioner, the purse was taken from his shoulder and searched.","start":465.377,"stop":470.812,"duration":5.44},{"text":"But it was uncontested that inside that purse at the time... after a valid custodial arrest, were ten amphetamine

court.","start":479.075,"stop":487.884,"duration":8.81},{"text":"Twenty days after being taken under advisement, the state filed a brief in opposition to the motion to suppress.","start":487.884,"stop":496.973,"duration":9.09},{"text":"The Appellate Court then affirmed the holding of the trial court suppressing the evidence.","start":496.973,"stop":504.549,"duration":7.58},{"text":"Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Illinois was denied, and this matter is before the Court on a writ of certiorari.","start":504.549,"stop":509.781,"duration":5.23},{"text":"The reasonableness of a post-arrest warrantless search of the Respondent's purse is predicated upon the right of the state to search the Respondent after his valid custodial arrest for disorderly conduct.","start":509.781,"stop":527.431,"duration":17.65},{"text":"The validity of Sergeant Mitzner's authority to search this individual after the arrest has remained virtually unchallenged in this Court.","start":527.431,"stop":539.066,"duration":11.63},{"text":"As this Court noted in Robinson, the right to search is not to be doubted.","start":539.066,"stop":544.36,"duration":5.29},{"text":"The arrest is a reasonable intrusion as this Court has said in the initial stage of prosecution which may lead to the ultimate relinquishment of liberty of this individual.","start":544.36,"stop":558.026,"duration":13.67},{"text":"When Sergeant Mitzner observed the Respondent's disorderly conduct and arrested him for that, Ralph Lafayette's expectation of privacy in the contents of his purse became subordinated to the legitimate and overriding interests of the state to search that purse.","start":558.026,"stop":579.44,"duration":21.41},{"text":"Those interests, as stated in this Court, that are monitored by police officers each day are the interests to disarm the person arrested, to protect the police officers and those around them, to remove the means of escape from the arrested person, and to prevent destruction of evidence that can be used against the person arrested.","start":579.44,"stop":602.478,"duration":23.04},{"text":"Now these interests that were monitored by Sergeant Mitzner were not tailored specifically for Ralph Lafayette.","start":602.478,"stop":611.366,"duration":8.89},{"text":"These are the interests served in every arrest and search incidental thereto.","start":611.366,"stop":616.722,"duration":5.36},{"text":"The interests served are not the justification for the search of Ralph Lafayette.","start":616.722,"stop":623.781,"duration":7.06},{"text":"The valid custodial arrest as this Court has indicated is the justification for that search, and the search needs no further justification.","start":623.781,"stop":635.011,"duration":11.23},{"text":"The breadth of authority to search is not limited, as this Court has held, by the crime arrested for.","start":635.011,"stop":643.852,"duration":8.84},{"text":"Despite the trivial nature of a crime that a police officer arrests an individual for, an officer never knows if he is facing the infamous, as this Court put it, trojan horse.","start":643.852,"stop":656.486,"duration":12.63},{"text":"It is of no moment to a post-arrest warrantless search that there may be an absence of the fruits of the crime arrested for or no evidence of the crime that can be seized in relation to the crime, although in this case the bizarre behavior of the Respondent could have been found in the evidence of amphetamines found in his purse.","start":656.486,"stop":682.507,"duration":26.02},{"text":"The Justification to search is not based upon the probability of finding weapons and evidence and means of escape in each and every case, but is based upon the valid custodial arrest.","start":682.507,"stop":695.564,"duration":13.06},{"text":"The state's interests to be protected after a valid custodial arrest are constant whether or not in a hindsight glance we can say that the interests were unlikely to have been served in that particular search incidental to arrest.","start":695.564,"stop":712.886,"duration":17.32}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"What was this man custodial arrested
