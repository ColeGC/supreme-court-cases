the Eighth Circuit.","start":4.385,"stop":13.658,"duration":9.27},{"text":"The issues in this case began when a drug task force in Minnesota was investigating the activities of one of Respondent's co-conspirators, one Armstrong, who they had reason to believe was engaged in the manufacture of illegal drugs.","start":13.658,"stop":34.987,"duration":21.33},{"text":"They acquired information that Armstrong was making purchases of certain precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of amphetamine from a particular drug company, and with the cooperation... or chemical company... and with the cooperation of that company, they placed a beeper or radio transmitter in a false bottom in a five-gallon container of chloroform which Armstrong was scheduled to pick up.","start":34.987,"stop":60.972,"duration":25.99},{"text":"Armstrong came to the chemical company, picked up the chloroform, loaded it in his car, and was then followed by physical visual surveillance to the home of co-defendant Petschen, where the container was seen to be transferred into Petschen's vehicle.","start":60.972,"stop":81.302,"duration":20.33},{"text":"Petschen then left and was followed both visually and with the use of the beeper as he drove from Minnesota to Wisconsin.","start":81.302,"stop":95.395,"duration":14.09},{"text":"At one point during his travels on the road, the officers lost both visual and beeper contact, but they regained it while he was still in the course of his trip, and then they lost it for a second time.","start":95.395,"stop":110.987,"duration":15.59},{"text":"At that point, with the aid of an aircraft, and after the passage of perhaps a half an hour to an hour, the beeper was located emitting signals from the property of Respondent Knotts.","start":110.987,"stop":125.414,"duration":14.43},{"text":"There followed a visual surveillance over the course of a couple of days, and then a warrant, search warrant was obtained to search the property and the search disclosed a clandestine laboratory to manufacture these chemicals, and of course the chloroform container which contained the beeper and various other precursor chemicals.","start":125.414,"stop":148.846,"duration":23.43},{"text":"The issue in this case is whether a warrant is required to monitor the signals emitted by a beeper from a container that has arrived at an individual's property.","start":148.846,"stop":160.154,"duration":11.31},{"text":"The answer to this question involves potentially two different kinds of inquiries.","start":160.154,"stop":165.022,"duration":4.87},{"text":"First, whether the use of this investigative technique is a search or seizure at all, regulated by the Fourth Amendment, and if the answer is no, that would, I think, end this case.","start":165.022,"stop":174.747,"duration":9.73},{"text":"Secondly, if it is a search or seizure, what quantum of suspicion must exist to support the use of this technique, and must such use be accompanied by a warrant.","start":174.747,"stop":186.804,"duration":12.06},{"text":"Now, before turning to these issues, I would like to tell the Court briefly something about how beepers or beacons, as they are called, operate, and how they are used.","start":186.804,"stop":197.26,"duration":10.46},{"text":"It is basically an FM transmitter that emits a radio signal which, when monitored, discloses the location of the beeper.","start":197.26,"stop":206.366,"duration":9.11},{"text":"There are some beepers, not the one in this case, that will also disclose when the package is being moved or opened.","start":206.366,"stop":214.055,"duration":7.69},{"text":"A beeper is a fairly expensive device.","start":214.055,"stop":217.407,"duration":3.35},{"text":"I am told it costs somewhere between $700 and $1,200.","start":217.407,"stop":220.626,"duration":3.22},{"text":"The kind of beeper used in this case is fairly small.","start":220.626,"stop":223.661,"duration":3.03},{"text":"It weighs about a half a pound, and is about three inches

object.","start":233.952,"stop":246.026,"duration":12.07},{"text":"Now, in either case, the basic purpose of this device is to be employed as an aid to surveillance to track movement.","start":246.026,"stop":256.382,"duration":10.36},{"text":"Now, the container beeper is sometimes employed for an additional purpose, in addition to tracking the movement, which is to determine whether the object, the container remains located at a particular place or, as I mentioned, in some instances, whether it has been opened.","start":256.382,"stop":277.112,"duration":20.73},{"text":"Now, car beepers are useful in a wide variety of cases, kidnapping cases, espionage cases, extortion cases, any kind of case where
