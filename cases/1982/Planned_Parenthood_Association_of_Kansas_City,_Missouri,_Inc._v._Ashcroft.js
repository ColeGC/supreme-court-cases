suggested very strongly by the Solicitor General... and in those cases that he suggests of different segments of society have strongly competing views is a terrifying thought.","start":322.667,"stop":341.05,"duration":18.38},{"text":"The entire concept of fundamental basic rights is sought to be undermined and discarded in one fell swoop.","start":341.05,"stop":348.969,"duration":7.92},{"text":"Constitutional rights will then be bargained by lobbying interests in the legislature, and woe be it to the minority who seek to rely on basic equality, justice and decency for their protection.","start":348.969,"stop":360.729,"duration":11.76},{"text":"A comment by Justice Blackmun, as to whether or not Roe versus Wade or Marbury versus Madison was being sought to be overruled I think is apropos.","start":360.729,"stop":370.647,"duration":9.92},{"text":"If one is to adopt the suggestions of the Solicitor General, 179 years of constitutional history would appear to fly out the door.","start":370.647,"stop":379.003,"duration":8.36},{"text":"I would suggest lastly in this regard that the government's somewhat simplistic suggestion of how to resolve this matter and how to avoid any further abortion cases coming before this Court creates more problems than it purports to solve.","start":379.003,"stop":392.701,"duration":13.7},{"text":"It basically would eliminate the entire concept, in my opinion, of fundamental rights.","start":392.701,"stop":396.856,"duration":4.15},{"text":"The first issue that I would wish to address in our chapter, in our section that was passed, is the issue of the minors.","start":396.856,"stop":405.228,"duration":8.37},{"text":"I would somewhat simplify this particular argument by noting that with two possible exceptions, it is a question of statutory construction.","start":405.228,"stop":415.739,"duration":10.51},{"text":"Those two exceptions would be whether or not this act does require or insure that appellate review be swift and complete.","start":415.739,"stop":426.203,"duration":10.46},{"text":"Respondents take the position that since this statute was enjoined the day following its enactment, the day following it went into law, since it has never been in practice in the state of Missouri, that the Supreme Court of the state of Missouri has waited to enact any rules covering appellate review in these cases.","start":426.203,"stop":444.899,"duration":18.7},{"text":"I don't know and would not speak to the reason they have waited.","start":444.899,"stop":449.475,"duration":4.58},{"text":"It is clear that in the three years since the statute has been on the books that no rules have been adopted.","start":449.475,"stop":455.129,"duration":5.65},{"text":"But again, in all candor, the statute has never been in effect to this date.","start":455.129,"stop":458.94,"duration":3.81},{"text":"The second exception that I would raise in addition to the statutory construction problem on this issue of the minors is that the statute makes absolutely no exceptions whatsoever for any emergency of any kind, even when life or health is threatened.","start":458.94,"stop":478.402,"duration":19.46},{"text":"Under all possible scenarios, it is necessary that the minor, if she cannot obtain the permission of one parent, go to the juvenile court and go through this hearing and any subsequent appeals that might come along the way, and receive the court's sanction for this procedure, regardless of the fact that her life or health is immediately being threatened by the fact that the doctor cannot perform the abortion.","start":478.402,"stop":506.874,"duration":28.47},{"text":"And yet, it is interesting to note that Section 3 of this same statute makes an exception of this very like kind when it is necessary to perform an abortion against the minor's will.","start":506.874,"stop":518.666,"duration":11.79},{"text":"It says if an abortion is necessary to save the life of the minor, and she doesn't want it and she says no, then the doctor may proceed.","start":518.666,"stop":530.209,"duration":11.54},{"text":"But not the reverse.","start":530.209,"stop":531.694,"duration":1.49},{"text":"If she wants the abortion and her life or health is threatened, he cannot proceed until he receives, again, the sanction of either one parent or the court.","start":531.694,"stop":542.283,"duration":10.59},{"text":"With those two exceptions, then, we are back to the statutory construction problem of Section 188.028.2(4).","start":542.283,"stop":552.716,"duration":10.43},{"text":"The district court found that the state had not made any argument to convince it that its interpretation of that statute was clear, that the use of this conjunctive word \"or\" between the options available to the juvenile court of a, b or c, the court had the option to pick any of those, and not necessarily in any order and not necessarily by rejecting others first.","start":552.716,"stop":576.504,"duration":23.79},{"text":"The appellate court disagreed.","start":576.504,"stop":578.097,"duration":1.59},{"text":"It came to an opposite conclusion.","start":578.097,"stop":581.173,"duration":3.08},{"text":"We have suggested in our Reply Brief recently filed with this Court that in light of the difference of opinions of reasonable judicial minds, that perhaps this Court should abstain from the issue inasmuch as a decision by the Missouri state courts would, in fact, or could possibly resolve any federal constitutional question as to what, in fact, the statute does mean.","start":581.173,"stop":606.101,"duration":24.93},{"text":"There has never been an opportunity for the Missouri state courts to rule on this issue, and perhaps abstention is appropriate.","start":606.101,"stop":612.223,"duration":6.12},{"text":"Abstention, in an identical type of situation, was the route taken by this Court in 1976 in Bellotti 1, and that position of abstaining in that kind of an issue was recently affirmed in H.L. versus Matheson in referencing Bellotti 1.","start":612.223,"stop":628.451,"duration":16.23},{"text":"The second matter that we would address is the in-hospital provision.","start":628.451,"stop":636.556,"duration":8.11},{"text":"This provision probably has the most serious impact upon the actual delivery of abortion services than any of the other provisions involved before this Court in this case.","start":636.556,"stop":650.27,"duration":13.71},{"text":"And probably in the other cases as well.","start":650.27,"stop":652.394,"duration":2.12},{"text":"It is clear that this provision would stop and prevent more procedures from taking place, than any of the other provisions involved or under review.","start":652.394,"stop":664.109,"duration":11.72},{"text":"As Justice Rehnquist indicated in the Themopolous case, it is the practice of this Court to take the factual findings of the lower courts as they find them.","start":664.109,"stop":674.684,"duration":10.57},{"text":"This case is unique in regard to the in-hospital provision, as opposed to any of the other district courts that have decided this issue, and there have been many.","start":674.684,"stop":683.243,"duration":8.56},{"text":"This issue has been decided by the District Court in Louisiana, in Kentucky, in Missouri and very recently and unreported yet, in the last two weeks, by courts in Illinois and Wisconsin.","start":683.243,"stop":696.003,"duration":12.76},{"text":"All have found that this is an unreasonable regulation.","start":696.003,"stop":701.329,"duration":5.33},{"text":"There were two separate district court trials on this issue, as I indicated.","start":701.329,"stop":705.39,"duration":4.06},{"text":"And in fact, the trial on remand, the second district court trial,... and it was specifically remanded for this particular issue because the appellate court said, we want to know specifically whether or not it is safer to perform second trimester procedures in a hospital or in an outpatient facility.","start":705.39,"stop":724.258,"duration":18.87},{"text":"And while the district court had held the section unconstitutional, they had not in so many words made that factual finding.","start":724.258,"stop":731.489,"duration":7.23},{"text":"And when it was sent back on remand and the second trial was held, respondents chose not to offer any testimony whatsoever.","start":731.489,"stop":737.736,"duration":6.25},{"text":"And the only additional witnesses at the trial on remand were those offered by the petitioner.","start":737.736,"stop":742.874,"duration":5.14},{"text":"The district court made some very specific findings.","start":742.874,"stop":746.794,"duration":3.92},{"text":"These are all contained in the Joint Appendix and the various opinions.","start":746.794,"stop":750.215,"duration":3.42},{"text":"They found, as a matter of fact, that the D&E procedure is the safest second trimester abortion technique currently available.","start":750.215,"stop":758.744,"duration":8.53},{"text":"They found that second trimester D&E procedures are currently performed in only one hospital in the entire state of Missouri, that being in Kansas City, Missouri which is on the western border.","start":758.744,"stop":770.674,"duration":11.93}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul

outpatient.","start":813.252,"stop":827.98,"duration":14.73},{"text":"The court found, as opposed to the 540 performed in a hospital when it could only be performed in a hospital in 1979, that in 1980

unmet need for second trimester procedures.","start":869.401,"stop":887.175,"duration":17.77},{"text":"And in 1980, when both hospitals and outpatient facilities could perform them, the unmet need
