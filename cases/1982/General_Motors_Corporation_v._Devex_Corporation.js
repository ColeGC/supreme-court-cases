royalty case, notwithstanding the history of the statute.","start":494.298,"stop":507.981,"duration":13.68},{"text":"To be sure, the Court added to its reference to Aro by seeking to justify the award of prejudgment interest because the defendant had the use of the royalty money in the time between the dates that infringement was held to take place and the time of judgment.","start":507.981,"stop":529.003,"duration":21.02},{"text":"But this is true in every case.","start":529.003,"stop":531.971,"duration":2.97},{"text":"There is always a span of time between

allowable in every case.","start":539.373,"stop":545.511,"duration":6.14},{"text":"In short, this reason only adds to the basic error of misapplying the dictum in the Aro case instead of looking to the Act as passed.","start":545.511,"stop":554.521,"duration":9.01},{"text":"The judgment should be reversed, because the decision below is based on a mandatory interest requirement that Congress rejected and is clearly contrary to the statute.","start":554.521,"stop":567.503,"duration":12.98},{"text":"Now, the history of the 1946 Act also answers other questions in this case.","start":567.503,"stop":573.283,"duration":5.78},{"text":"Devex contends that the term 35 USC 284 requires prejudgment interest.","start":573.283,"stop":582.201,"duration":8.92},{"text":"But the 1946 Act as it was passed by the House and reached the Senate provided for due compensation, not less than a reasonably royalty, using that very term, and the statute or post statute at that time also used explicitly required interest from the time infringement occurred.","start":582.201,"stop":602.443,"duration":20.24},{"text":"After the Senate amendments, the reference to due compensation not

interest.","start":620.529,"stop":632.024,"duration":11.5},{"text":"Otherwise, why the explicit reference to interest from the time the infringement occurred before the amendment, and why the reference to the interest as may be fixed by the court after the amendment?","start":632.024,"stop":650.111,"duration":18.09},{"text":"At no point in the history was due compensation treated as if it required interest, and the same is true of damages adequate to compensate as the term is used in 35 USC 284.","start":650.111,"stop":664.574,"duration":14.46},{"text":"Now, the history in the text of the 1946 Patent Act also compels the conclusion that the Act codified the pre-existing decisions on prejudgment interest in patent cases.","start":664.574,"stop":677.988,"duration":13.41},{"text":"Prior to the 1946 Act, this Court had rendered a number of decisions on prejudgment interest in patent
