relevance.","start":579.623,"stop":585.637,"duration":6.01},{"text":"And it's quite clear that in civil discovery a plaintiff who can show nothing more than mere relevance is not entitled to work

does.","start":606.72,"stop":607.781,"duration":1.06}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"And could the Government have claimed a privilege under that aspect of the rule in

decisionmaker but are merely being written in order to assess various aspects of a particular litigation, and therefore those documents may not fall within the deliberative process privilege, although they would seem clearly to fall within the work product privilege, as both the district court and the Court of Appeals in this case held.","start":618.918,"stop":644.628,"duration":25.71},{"text":"So while in some categories of cases there may be an overlap between the two privileges, in this case I don't think there is an overlap and in a great many cases there wouldn't be an overlap.","start":644.628,"stop":654.404,"duration":9.78},{"text":"All the Government would have available to it would be the work product
