Wallace","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, it's arguable that the ball would move with greater ease without it, but this is what the Board has been doing to explain its decisions, and it is the context against which Congress legislated in Taft-Hartley in revising the law.","start":450.615,"stop":471.074,"duration":20.46},{"text":"I don't think what they did on this subject in Taft-Hartley can be

views.","start":471.074,"stop":487.224,"duration":16.15},{"text":"I think to understand what has occurred in this field, we have to recognize how the Board has been analyzing these cases, even if it

overview.","start":499.454,"stop":504.203,"duration":4.75},{"text":"I was saying, if the general counsel was unable to show that it was a pretext, the clearest way of doing that would be to show that the reason didn't exist at all factually, or as was the case with one of the reasons here, that the employer didn't know about it until after the discharge decision was made.","start":504.203,"stop":527.959,"duration":23.76},{"text":"Or there can be other ways of showing it was a pretext, such as by showing that this was commonly done with impunity by other employees to the knowledge of the employer.","start":527.959,"stop":537.985,"duration":10.03},{"text":"In any event, if he doesn't succeed in showing that it was a pretext, but nonetheless carries his burden of persuasion, showing by a preponderance of the evidence that anti-union animus was also a motivating factor, then we have a true dual motive case, and we have a case in which the general counsel has satisfied his burden of persuasion that a violation of Section 8(a)(3) occurred by showing that the adverse action, the discharge took place for a prohibited reason, because from the beginning, if the discharge took place in whole or in part for a prohibitive... for a prohibited reason, that was sufficient to show a violation.","start":537.985,"stop":593.571,"duration":55.59},{"text":"Part of the confusion stems, however, from the fact that the Board still refers to this showing as a prima facie case, and the reason it does that is because it recognizes the possibility of the employer still establishing an affirmative defense, by showing with respect to a hypothetical question that the discharge would have occurred for the legitimate reasons even in the absence of the improper motivation for the discharge.","start":593.571,"stop":632.368,"duration":38.8},{"text":"And on that question, the Board has consistently placed the burden of persuasion as well as of production on the employer, and the Board has referred to this as an affirmative defense, and the issue in this case, the difference between the Board and the court of appeals in this case focuses solely on this phase of the analysis.","start":632.368,"stop":660.748,"duration":28.38},{"text":"Now, whether it is proper for the Board to place the burden of persuasion on this question on the employer, or whether the burden of persuasion must remain with the general counsel on this question, and this is a matter that was addressed with great specificity in the legislative history of Taft-Hartley, and unlike some cases in which the Board appears before the Court, where we are contending that the Board's interpretation of the Act on a specific matter is a reasonable interpretation among reasonable alternatives, and therefore should be sustained, this, it seems to us, is an interpretation required by the legislative history of the revision of the Act in Taft-Hartley.","start":660.748,"stop":720.443,"duration":59.69},{"text":"And I would like to turn to the pertinent materials.","start":720.443,"stop":726.363,"duration":5.92},{"text":"It was well established, as we have shown in cases collected starting at Page 15 of our brief, prior to Taft-Hartley, that if the discharge was motivated in whole or in part by the improper motivation, a violation had been shown, and that the burden was on the employer to prove as a defense that he would have reached the same result in the absence of the improper motivation.","start":726.363,"stop":770.703,"duration":44.34},{"text":"Many Board opinions, and we have quoted one on Page 16, referred to language used in a well known Second Circuit opinion, NLRB against Remington Rand, which is cited at the bottom of Page 16 of our brief, in which Learned Hand rejected the defense factually, although he said it was a proper defense for the employer to make, in language that was quoted and requoted many times, that it rested upon the tort feasor, as he called the employer, because the general counsel had shown that he had acted out of improper motivation.","start":770.703,"stop":813.045,"duration":42.34},{"text":"It rested upon the tort feasor to disentangle the consequences for which it was chargeable from those for which it was immune.","start":813.045,"stop":821.136,"duration":8.09},{"text":"And that interpretation was made clear in annual reports to Congress which we have cited in Footnote 9 on Page 18, and was criticized in the House hearings quite specifically.","start":821.136,"stop":839.379,"duration":18.24},{"text":"We have referred to that also in Footnote 9.","start":839.379,"stop":843.174,"duration":3.79},{"text":"And a change in the law was advocated, and indeed the House bill would have changed the law specifically in that respect, and on Page 18 of our brief we have described the provision that was in the House bill to change the law on that question.","start":843.174,"stop":863.495,"duration":20.32},{"text":"That provision was not in the Senate bill, and the conference committee struck it in favor of retaining the existing practice before the Board.","start":863.495,"stop":876.301,"duration":12.81},{"text":"This was one of many examples, as we have reminded the Court from time to time, in which the strategy of the conference was against making particular changes because they had in mind larger objectives to be achieved in Taft-Hartley.","start":876.301,"stop":897.917,"duration":21.62},{"text":"It was the first time that the Act was going to specify categories of unfair labor practices by unions, for example.","start":897.917,"stop":907.117,"duration":9.2},{"text":"They wanted to overrule this Court's Packard decision, which had included foremen within bargaining units, and they knew they had to anticipate a veto from President Truman, so they had to keep together a broad-based coalition that would be able to override the veto, and other matters were not being changed because of their desire to accomplish these major objectives.","start":907.117,"stop":934.199,"duration":27.08},{"text":"And Senator Taft, in an extended interchange on the floor in reporting the conference bill, and we have quoted pertinent portions of it on Page 20 of our brief, an extended interchange with Senator Pepper, who was raising this problem that the House had tried to shift the burden of proof away from the employer on this issue, kept pointing out repeatedly that this was struck by the conference committee from the House bill, and as we say at the conclusion of the excerpt we have here, under provision of the conference report, the employer has to make the proof.","start":934.199,"stop":976.105,"duration":41.91},{"text":"This is the present rule and the present practice of the
