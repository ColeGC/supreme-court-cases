damage.","start":623.751,"stop":639.558,"duration":15.81},{"text":"The damages provisions of section 11 are well defined and fairly restrictive.","start":639.558,"stop":646.43,"duration":6.87},{"text":"The principal restriction which is operative generally is that a participant in the registration process is liable only for an

underwriters.","start":684.695,"stop":692.583,"duration":7.89},{"text":"An underwriter is generally liable only for that portion of the securities underwritten by

underwrites.","start":706.03,"stop":714.464,"duration":8.43},{"text":"In the facts of the present case, that is fairly graphically demonstrated by Russ & Company, which I have chosen just because they're one of the smaller underwriters.","start":714.464,"stop":725.351,"duration":10.89},{"text":"They underwrote 30 units out of the 3,300 units which were sold in this offering.","start":725.351,"stop":732.145,"duration":6.79},{"text":"Under section 11 the aggregate liability of Russ & Company would have been $44,000.","start":732.145,"stop":740.749,"duration":8.6},{"text":"Under 10(b)5 or under 17(a), if those statutes providing client remedies, the liability of Russ & Company would be $4,400,000 plus... plus... any additional premium over and above that which might arise as a result of the fact that those securities trade at a premium.","start":740.749,"stop":764.006,"duration":23.26},{"text":"So the effect of permitting plaintiffs recourse to 10(b)5 and 17(a) is to dramatically increase the exposure of certain defendants.","start":764.006,"stop":777.58,"duration":13.57},{"text":"One other significant effect is that section 11 only imposes liability on certain... certain persons.","start":777.58,"stop":793.542,"duration":15.96},{"text":"Not every participant in the process of preparing a registration statement or bringing an offering to market is even potentially liable.","start":793.542,"stop":803.6,"duration":10.06},{"text":"For example, attorneys for underwriters are not liable

be involved, because of the large expenses which are incurred in defending oneself.","start":847.41,"stop":858.64,"duration":11.23},{"text":"The fact of the matter is that 10(b)5 lawsuits are

a great many decisions allowing recovery under section 10(b) without any discussion at all of whether an express remedy would apply, although from the facts of those cases it appears that such express
