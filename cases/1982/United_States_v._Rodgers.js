Revenue Service made assessments against Philip Bosco in excess of $900,000 for federal wagering taxes.","start":153.544,"stop":165.776,"duration":12.23},{"text":"Bosco died in

liability or unsatisfied tax liability.","start":180.458,"stop":201.807,"duration":21.35},{"text":"In the other case, Respondent Ingram and her husband, Donald Ingram, acquired real property during

Ingram.","start":235.449,"stop":245.556,"duration":10.11},{"text":"After unsuccessfully attempting to dispose of the properties, Respondent Ingram and the trustee for the properties filed this action

property.","start":245.556,"stop":264.048,"duration":18.49},{"text":"The United States removed the action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, and filed a

argument.","start":292.662,"stop":298.176,"duration":5.51},{"text":"The court of appeals held that because the homestead interest of a spouse is characterized as a property interest under Texas law,

claims.","start":369.1,"stop":384.266,"duration":15.17},{"text":"Homestead property is not mentioned in Section 6334, nor does any other federal statute purport to exempt such property from federal

point.","start":402.071,"stop":406.832,"duration":4.76},{"text":"No provision of a state law may exempt property or rights to property from levy for the collection of any federal tax.","start":406.832,"stop":416.222,"duration":9.39},{"text":"Thus, property exempt from execution under state personal or homestead exemptions... exemption laws is nevertheless subject to levy by the United States for collection of its taxes.","start":416.222,"stop":427.543,"duration":11.32},{"text":"Under Section 6321, the United States has a lien on all property and rights to property
