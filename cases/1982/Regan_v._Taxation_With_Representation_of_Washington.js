right.","start":346.354,"stop":357.445,"duration":11.09},{"text":"Nevertheless, the Court held that there was a legal protection violation because there is a basic difference between direct state interference with a protective activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislative policy.","start":357.445,"stop":371.44,"duration":14},{"text":"Now the difference between those cases and the instant case: in our view there are two that are relevant, and both of them make this case a stronger case for constitutionality than in Harris and in Monner.","start":371.44,"stop":384.48,"duration":13.04},{"text":"The first difference is that in those cases the two things that were treated differently were mutually preclusive competitors.","start":384.48,"stop":392.79,"duration":8.31},{"text":"That is to say, the statutorily preferred event which was birth necessarily precluded the constitutionally protected abortion

contrast, subsidizing veterans groups has no automatic detrimental effect on charitable groups.","start":412.751,"stop":421.292,"duration":8.54},{"text":"The second difference, and in my view the more important one, is that the classification in this case is part of our national acts of laws.","start":421.292,"stop":431.461,"duration":10.17},{"text":"This Court has made it very clear that for equal protection purposes, income tax cases are in a class by themselves.","start":431.461,"stop":440.129,"duration":8.67},{"text":"The Internal Revenue Code is perhaps without peer in its intricacy, its detail, and its sheer length.","start":440.129,"stop":447.344,"duration":7.21},{"text":"By their very nature, most income tax provisions classify.","start":447.344,"stop":452.53,"duration":5.19},{"text":"Their function is to identify under what circumstances the burden of different groups in our society, the share of the National tax burden borne by different groups is to be either increased or decreased.","start":452.53,"stop":468.413,"duration":15.88},{"text":"In carrying out this function, Congress necessarily treats different people in different ways, and many of those differences have an arguable impact on a fundamental right.","start":468.413,"stop":478.317,"duration":9.9},{"text":"Importing heightened scrutiny as the test governing the constitutionality of that kind of a complex and inner-related statutory construct would seriously damage the certainty and the predictability that should be characteristic of our national tax laws.","start":478.317,"stop":496.278,"duration":17.96},{"text":"Aside from everything else that ought to go into a fair tax system, it is important that taxpayers know with as much certainty as possible what their obligations are.","start":496.278,"stop":506.507,"duration":10.23},{"text":"That certainty value is enhanced by the rational basis equal protection has because of the likelihood that it ensures that the congressional judgment will in fact survive.","start":506.507,"stop":519.051,"duration":12.54},{"text":"It is diminished, correspondingly, by a test of heightened scrutiny.","start":519.051,"stop":525.143,"duration":6.09},{"text":"Look at the matter from Congress's standpoint.","start":525.143,"stop":527.42,"duration":2.28},{"text":"It is probable that the time will never come when Congress does not have before it some proposal for change in the income tax law.","start":527.42,"stop":537.06,"duration":9.64},{"text":"Congress's ability to respond to new developments, new information, new understanding is a difficult enough task under any circumstances.","start":537.06,"stop":547.601,"duration":10.54},{"text":"It should not be rendered even more burdensome by increasing the likelihood that the judgments that Congress makes will be turned around by the Courts.","start":547.601,"stop":557.235,"duration":9.63},{"text":"Take this case, for example: Section 501(c) consists of 22 categories.","start":557.235,"stop":562.562,"duration":5.33},{"text":"It comes of no surprise to anyone that the Court of Appeals found that two of those categories resulted in a difference in treatment to their occupants.","start":562.562,"stop":575.435,"duration":12.87},{"text":"Of course, there are differences in treatment.","start":575.435,"stop":577.588,"duration":2.15},{"text":"If Congress had not intended differences in treatment, there would not be 22 categories.","start":577.588,"stop":583.912,"duration":6.32},{"text":"The point is that the entire Code, and not just these 22 categories, essentially consists of differences in treatment.","start":583.912,"stop":592.113,"duration":8.2},{"text":"That, I submit, is why this Court has consistently accorded great deference to Congressional line drawing in the income tax area.","start":592.113,"stop":600.984,"duration":8.87},{"text":"It is repeatedly stated, and most recently in San Antonio versus Rodriguez, that in taxation, even more than in other fields,

point.","start":614.352,"stop":616.977,"duration":2.63},{"text":"That is whether the distinction between lobbying by veterans groups on the one hand and lobbying by 501(c)(3) organizations on the

there were no express statutory limitations on lobbying by exempt organizations.","start":632.624,"stop":642.576,"duration":9.95},{"text":"Congress was concerned, however, in 1934 that the deductibility of contributions to organizations otherwise classified as religious, charitable, or education could effectively translate into the public financing of private propagandizing on a range of subjects limited only by the donor's whim and the attractiveness of that abuse increased with the donor's wealth.","start":642.576,"stop":671,"duration":28.42},{"text":"It was a concern that was first expressed by Judge Hand for a unanimous Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1930 in a case called Slee versus The Commissioner, and as this Court observed in Cammarano, the 1934 act made explicit the conclusion derived by Judge Hand in 1930 in Slee.","start":671,"stop":687.416,"duration":16.42},{"text":"Very simply, there are differences between veterans organizations on the one hand

1934.","start":687.416,"stop":704.563,"duration":17.15},{"text":"In the first place, there are quantitative differences.","start":704.563,"stop":707.655,"duration":3.09},{"text":"The number of veterans organizations is only a fraction of the total number of the 501(c)(3) groups, and the 501(c)(3)'s collect about 1500 times as much in contributions as do the veterans groups.","start":707.655,"stop":723.054,"duration":15.4},{"text":"Even more important, these organizations structurally by virtue of the way they are chartered by Congress and in fact carry out their
