Court as \"odd, if not bizarre\".","start":171.945,"stop":181.691,"duration":9.75},{"text":"To the trained eyes of the agents, this behavior seemed designed to detect surveillance, and created a suspicion in their minds that Respondent was a drug courier.","start":181.691,"stop":191.622,"duration":9.93},{"text":"The officers also noted that Respondent had purchased his ticket with cash, and that there were certain discrepancies in the information on his baggage tags.","start":191.622,"stop":200.088,"duration":8.47},{"text":"They approached Respondent in the boarding area, and had a brief

York.","start":221.535,"stop":227.859,"duration":6.32},{"text":"They also observed him engaged in a series of maneuvers that appeared to them to be designed to detect and evade surveillance, and that indicated to these officers as well that Respondent likely was a drug courier.","start":227.859,"stop":241.009,"duration":13.15},{"text":"After Respondent retrieved his bags from the baggage claim, the agents approached him, identified themselves, and informed him that he was suspected of carrying narcotics.","start":241.009,"stop":251.74,"duration":10.73},{"text":"Respondent immediately stated

carrying were his, Respondent said that they were, and then he falsely stated that he had already been surrounded by a gang of agents in Miami who searched both his person and his bags.","start":259.08,"stop":272.607,"duration":13.53},{"text":"Respondent subsequently refused a request by the officers to consent to a search of his bags, and then asked them whether he was under arrest.","start":272.607,"stop":281.01,"duration":8.4},{"text":"Agent Whitmore informed him that he was free to leave, but that his luggage would be kept and taken to a judge to determine whether there was probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant.","start":281.01,"stop":291.863,"duration":10.85},{"text":"The agents explained to Respondent that they would not open the luggage without a warrant, and that they would return it to him if no warrant was issued.","start":291.863,"stop":300.204,"duration":8.34},{"text":"Some further conversation ensued, in which Respondent retracted his earlier admission of ownership of one of the bags, and asked the officers whether some arrangement could be made or whether something could be fixed up so that he could still leave the airport with his bags.","start":300.204,"stop":316.121,"duration":15.92},{"text":"Ultimately, Respondent stated that he had pressing engagements and did not wish to remain with his luggage, and the agents gave him a number for him to contact them to arrange for the return of his luggage.","start":316.121,"stop":327.664,"duration":11.54},{"text":"The agents then took the luggage to the Customs mail handling facility at Kennedy Airport to arrange for exposure to a drug-detecting dog.","start":327.664,"stop":336.816,"duration":9.15},{"text":"Approximately 90 minutes after the luggage was taken from Respondent, the dog reacted positively to one suitcase.","start":336.816,"stop":344.016,"duration":7.2},{"text":"After a search warrant was obtained, the suitcase was opened, and substantial quantities of cocaine, marijuana, and LSD were found.","start":344.016,"stop":351.872,"duration":7.86},{"text":"The District Court denied a motion to suppress, finding that Agent Whitmore had reasonable suspicion that Respondent's suitcase contained contraband, and that this suspicion justified the temporary detention of the luggage to arrange for the dog sniff.","start":351.872,"stop":366.71,"duration":14.84},{"text":"A divided Court of Appeals reversed.","start":366.71,"stop":369.303,"duration":2.59},{"text":"The majority accepted the District Court's finding of reasonable suspicion, but held that the detention of a suitcase based on such suspicion could last no longer than could a temporary detention of a person, and hence the 90-minute
