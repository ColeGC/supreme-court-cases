Fleischman, which happened to be a criminal contempt proceeding involving a congressional subpoena.","start":637.316,"stop":661.104,"duration":23.79},{"text":"But it explains that the rule being adopted is a rule affecting merely the time and manner of proof rather than a shift of the burden of persuasion, but it explains that the prosecution would be under a serious practical handicap if it must negate all possible defenses, and that the... the relevant facts are peculiarly within the respondent's knowledge of why, contrary to what one would normally think of the president of a corporation, he is not in a position to comply with the subpoena.","start":661.104,"stop":702.993,"duration":41.89},{"text":"There is sort of a presumption of business regularity, that the person normally thought to be in possession or control of a business' records would be the person to seek them from.","start":702.993,"stop":717.643,"duration":14.65},{"text":"This is the way grand jury subpoenas are issued, and there's never any further showing than that.","start":717.643,"stop":724.077,"duration":6.43},{"text":"Then it's up to that officer to say why it is that he can't comply.","start":724.077,"stop":729.233,"duration":5.16}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Wallace, could I interrupt you for a moment?","start":729.233,"stop":730.34,"duration":1.11},{"text":"You say you don't think it makes any difference that he was late making this.","start":730.34,"stop":734.107,"duration":3.77},{"text":"He didn't make the same showing at the original judicial enforcement proceeding.","start":734.107,"stop":738.852,"duration":4.75},{"text":"Do you rely at all on the fact that instead of getting on the witness stand, he submitted this so-called written oath?","start":738.852,"stop":744.866,"duration":6.01},{"text":"Supposing he had gotten on the witness stand and said exactly the same thing he said in the oath?","start":744.866,"stop":748.551,"duration":3.69}]},{"speakerName":"Lawrence G.
