right to access to records of government contractors... books and records.","start":61.101,"stop":74.095,"duration":12.99},{"text":"To put the access provisions in context, it must be recalled that when Congress created the GAO in 1921, it directed that the Comptroller investigate all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement and application of public funds, and further directed the Comptroller to make recommendations to Congress looking for greater economy or efficiency in public expenditures.","start":74.095,"stop":99.43,"duration":25.34},{"text":"Under that mandate, the Comptroller has, for sixty years, examined the fiscal responsibility and the manner in which federal agencies have discharged their fiscal responsibilities, with an eye towards increasing efficiency and promoting economy in the expenditure of public funds.","start":99.43,"stop":119.108,"duration":19.68},{"text":"There should be no doubt that this is precisely the function Congress assigned to the GAO when it included the word 1921 Act.","start":119.108,"stop":130.01,"duration":10.9},{"text":"Congressman Lutes, who proposed that addition, stated that its purpose is to make sure that the Comptroller General shall concern himself not simply with taking in and paying out of money from an accountant's point of view, but that he shall also concern himself with the question as to whether it is economically and efficiently applied.","start":130.01,"stop":150.611,"duration":20.6},{"text":"Now following World War II, Congress recognized the explosive growth in purchases from the private sector required that the Comptroller be given additional powers so he could discharge these responsibilities properly.","start":150.611,"stop":163.84,"duration":13.23},{"text":"For this reason, Congress passed the access to records statutes at issue in this case.","start":163.84,"stop":169.807,"duration":5.97},{"text":"They gave the Comptroller access to records of government contractors so that he would have the necessary tool to examine the transactions from both sides.","start":169.807,"stop":178.553,"duration":8.75},{"text":"This was based on Congress' determination that only with this full information could GAO discharge its duties in a meaningful way.","start":178.553,"stop":188.783,"duration":10.23},{"text":"And Congress focused special concern on negotiated contracts... those that were made without advertised solicitation of bids.","start":188.783,"stop":197.358,"duration":8.58},{"text":"Because negotiated contracts lack the inherent safeguards of advertised contracts, they are more susceptible to abuse and more likely to result in waste and extravagance.","start":197.358,"stop":209.526,"duration":12.17},{"text":"In a word, they pose a greater risk that the government will pay unreasonably high prices, and for that reason Congress determined that negotiated contracts require close supervision and control.","start":209.526,"stop":221.833,"duration":12.31},{"text":"In fact, negotiated contracts were prohibited by law until World War II.","start":221.833,"stop":226.955,"duration":5.12},{"text":"In this case, GAO seeks to exercise its statutory right of access to Merck's records relating to only four of the many negotiated
