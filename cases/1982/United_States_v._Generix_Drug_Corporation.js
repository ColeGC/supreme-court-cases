Court:","start":35.294,"stop":36.811,"duration":1.52},{"text":"This case presents an important question under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that will have a profound effect on the public health.","start":36.811,"stop":44.961,"duration":8.15},{"text":"The Court of Appeals' decision permits the sale without FDA approval of a large category of prescription medicines known as generic drugs.","start":44.961,"stop":54.41,"duration":9.45},{"text":"Such products purport to be interchangeable with preexisting or pioneer drugs for treating serious and life-threatening diseases, but they are not identical to the pioneers and they may in fact be unsafe and ineffective.","start":54.41,"stop":69.36,"duration":14.95},{"text":"By way of background, I should explain that drugs are composed active ingredients, which are intended to have a therapeutic effect on the patient, and inactive ingredients, which are not intended to have a therapeutic effect.","start":69.36,"stop":82.743,"duration":13.38},{"text":"The inactive ingredients, however, play an important role.","start":82.743,"stop":86.491,"duration":3.75},{"text":"They may comprise 90 to 99 percent of a product and they often have a significant impact on how the active ingredient does its job.","start":86.491,"stop":96.396,"duration":9.91},{"text":"For example, the inactive ingredients influence how much active ingredient reaches the bloodstream and how quickly this occurs.","start":96.396,"stop":104.265,"duration":7.87},{"text":"So even if two drugs have the same active ingredient, we cannot assume that they will have the same results.","start":104.265,"stop":111.015,"duration":6.75},{"text":"The inactive ingredients may slow down or block the action of the active ingredient altogether, so it's as if the patient took no medication at all.","start":111.015,"stop":120.806,"duration":9.79},{"text":"For a patient who's taking a drug to control high blood pressure, such as most of the drugs involved in this case were, this means he runs the risk of heart attach or stroke.","start":120.806,"stop":131.129,"duration":10.32},{"text":"On the other hand, the inactive ingredients can speed up or increase the effect of the active ingredient, and this is perhaps most apparent in time release drugs, where the result can be a dumping of active ingredients too quickly into the bloodstream, causing toxicity, overdose and other adverse side effects.","start":131.129,"stop":150.217,"duration":19.09},{"text":"It's as if in that case the patient has taken two or three or ten times the appropriate dosage.","start":150.217,"stop":156.276,"duration":6.06},{"text":"By the same token, different manufacturing methods can also affect how the drug works.","start":156.276,"stop":161.931,"duration":5.66},{"text":"If the drug is packed too densely or too loosely into the tablet, the patient may suffer from wholly unintended reactions.","start":161.931,"stop":169.726,"duration":7.79},{"text":"These differences are vitally important for generic drugs.","start":169.726,"stop":173.24,"duration":3.51},{"text":"These drugs are offered as substitutes for preexisting products whose effects and proper dosages are well known.","start":173.24,"stop":181.689,"duration":8.45},{"text":"But unless the generic actually performs the same way the pioneer does, the substitution may be dangerous.","start":181.689,"stop":189.075,"duration":7.39},{"text":"Because the generic company does not know the full composition or manufacturing methods of the pioneer, the only way to be assured that the copy and the pioneer will in fact work the same way is by testing one against the other.","start":189.075,"stop":204.053,"duration":14.98},{"text":"If they perform in a similar way, they are considered to be bioequivalent and substitution will not affect the patient.","start":204.053,"stop":211.521,"duration":7.47},{"text":"But if they do not work the same way, then substitution poses a real danger.","start":211.521,"stop":217.082,"duration":5.56},{"text":"In this case, the district court found that the products Respondent sold were not tested and were not generally recognized by experts as safe and effective for their intended uses, and that was all the Government needed to show for Respondents to be enjoined.","start":217.082,"stop":233.884,"duration":16.8},{"text":"But the Eleventh Circuit held that these untested drugs could be sold with no scrutiny whatsoever.","start":233.884,"stop":240.194,"duration":6.31},{"text":"The court wrongly concluded that the Act's use of the term \"drug\" refers only to active ingredients and not to the real life drugs that doctors prescribe, pharmacists dispense, and patients ingest, that is drugs as products.","start":240.194,"stop":257.688,"duration":17.49},{"text":"As a result, the court has discarded the carefully crafted statutory scheme that assures that all drugs available for consumption by the public are in advance determined by experts to be safe and effective.","start":257.688,"stop":271.573,"duration":13.88},{"text":"And this holding creates a mammoth exception that would allow
