likely although still unlikely occurrence is that ground water would penetrate the repository, but ground water usually moves very slowly and the Commission calculated that by the time the radioactive materials in the groundwater reached the surface they would be so diluted and they would have decayed to such a degree that a person receiving the maximum exposure to that ground water would be subject to radiation roughly equal to the background radiation of the atmosphere and the soil.","start":320.481,"stop":355.468,"duration":34.99},{"text":"The Commission accordingly concluded that so far as science could determine the chances of a substantial release of radiation from the repository are minimal to the point of being banishing, and the more likely occurrences would not release significant amounts of radiation.","start":355.468,"stop":376.881,"duration":21.41},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals did not question that conclusion.","start":376.881,"stop":381.677,"duration":4.8},{"text":"At the same time the Commission acknowledged explicitly and, in fact, repeatedly that there is, of course, a certain irreducible and imponderable uncertainty involved in predicting what will happen so far into the future and in making predictions about a repository site that has not yet been specifically designated.","start":381.677,"stop":406.495,"duration":24.82},{"text":"But the Commission concluded that although these uncertainties exist, a reasonable working assumption that the licensing boards are to use is that there will be no releases of radiation from the solid wastes once the repository has been sealed.","start":406.495,"stop":425.472,"duration":18.98},{"text":"The Court of Appeals had

rulemaking record that had been greatly supplemented by the Commission, invalidated all versions of the rule on the ground that the Commission violated the National Environmental Policy Act when it determined not to allow licensing boards to reconsider in individual proceedings the uncertainties associated with the disposal of high-level wastes.","start":443.652,"stop":471.78,"duration":28.13},{"text":"We then sought certiorari.","start":471.78,"stop":473.826,"duration":2.05},{"text":"Although the Court of Appeals based its decision squarely on NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act, it never identified the language in NEPA or in any decision of this Court that prohibits the Commission from doing what it did here.","start":473.826,"stop":496.443,"duration":22.62},{"text":"As this Court has said several times, what NEPA requires is that an agency consider the environmental consequences of its actions and ordinarily disclose them to the public.","start":496.443,"stop":510.296,"duration":13.85},{"text":"The Commission did consider the uncertainties associated with high-level waste disposal, and it made those uncertainties fully explicit.","start":510.296,"stop":519.371,"duration":9.07},{"text":"In fact, the Court of Appeals did not suggest otherwise.","start":519.371,"stop":523.37,"duration":4},{"text":"On the contrary, both the Court of Appeals and Respondents quote at some length from the Commission's own statements in attempting to show what we freely concede, that there are inevitably uncertainties associated with an inquiry of this sort, nor was the Commission's consideration of these issues not meaningful or only abstract as the Court of Appeals suggested.","start":523.37,"stop":550.373,"duration":27},{"text":"For several years the Commission has been on record as saying that it would not continue to license reactors at all if it did not have reasonable assurance that wastes could be disposed of safely.","start":550.373,"stop":565.414,"duration":15.04},{"text":"If the ultimate outcome of the Commission's investigation of the waste disposal problem had been that the risks associated with any category of wastes are unacceptably great or if that is ever the outcome because the Commission's investigation of this matter is continuing, the Commission would halt all reactor licensing.","start":565.414,"stop":588.077,"duration":22.66},{"text":"If the Commission were to conclude that the risks associated with waste disposal, while not that severe, are still grave it would be open to it to decide, for example, to permit reactors to be built or operated only where the need for power is particularly exigent.","start":588.077,"stop":606.632,"duration":18.55},{"text":"But the Commission concluded instead that the ascertainable risks are minimal, and as I said the Court of Appeals did not question that conclusion on this rulemaking record and that the unavoidable uncertainties should not affect the rate at which reactors are licensed.","start":606.632,"stop":625.499,"duration":18.87},{"text":"Since that conclusion was reached after thorough, explicit and candid consideration, it simply cannot violate
