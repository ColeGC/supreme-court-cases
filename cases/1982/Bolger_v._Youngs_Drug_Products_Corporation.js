Code prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptive products.","start":25.799,"stop":39.763,"duration":13.96},{"text":"Section 3001(e)(2) does not prohibit any mailing that the recipient has indicated a desire to receive.","start":39.763,"stop":48.027,"duration":8.26},{"text":"The issue in this case is whether that statute violates the First Amendment.","start":48.027,"stop":53.961,"duration":5.93},{"text":"This action was brought by the appellee, which has been a manufacturer of contraceptive products for some 60 years, and is by its own account the leader in the field.","start":53.961,"stop":68.764,"duration":14.8},{"text":"Until 1979, appellee promoted its products by means of a sales force and advertisements in magazines.","start":68.764,"stop":78.996,"duration":10.23},{"text":"In 1979, after what appellee describes as business discussions, appellee inaugurated a new marketing strategy that included in addition to its other traditional means of advertising a campaign of mass unsolicited mailings to members of the general public at large.","start":78.996,"stop":104.347,"duration":25.35},{"text":"The Postal Service advised appellee that these mailings would violate Section 3001(e)(2), and appellee then brought this suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that Section 3001(e)(2) violated the Constitution, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.","start":104.347,"stop":127.412,"duration":23.07},{"text":"The District Court found that appellee's mailings are commercial solicitations and promotional materials in which appellee has a commercial interest.","start":127.412,"stop":140.581,"duration":13.17},{"text":"It accordingly declared that they are commercial speech, entitled to lesser protection under the First Amendment.","start":140.581,"stop":150.872,"duration":10.29},{"text":"The District Court also concluded that Section 3001(e)(2) directly furthers specific and important government interests.","start":150.872,"stop":163.053,"duration":12.18},{"text":"But the District Court nonetheless declared Section 3001(e)(2) unconstitutional because it believed that it could devise an alternative that, while not protecting the government's interests quite as well, struck what the District Court viewed as a better balance.","start":163.053,"stop":181.284,"duration":18.23},{"text":"That alternative was highly elaborate.","start":181.284,"stop":185.063,"duration":3.78},{"text":"Its central feature was a series of warnings in large letters on the outside of appellee's unsolicited mailings.","start":185.063,"stop":194.184,"duration":9.12},{"text":"The District Court ordered its alternative into effect and enjoined the enforcement of Section 3001(e)(2).","start":194.184,"stop":204.524,"duration":10.34},{"text":"We then brought this appeal.","start":204.524,"stop":207.539,"duration":3.01},{"text":"Unlike restrictions on commercial expression that this Court has invalidated in the past, Section 3001(e)(2) is a narrow and specific limitation, and its effect on First Amendment rights can only be described as minimal.","start":207.539,"stop":228.733,"duration":21.19},{"text":"It has no application to any form of non-commercial speech.","start":228.733,"stop":234.699,"duration":5.97},{"text":"For that reason, organizations that advocate birth control or family planning as a social or moral matter are free to do so by using the mails, even by using the mails on an unsolicited basis.","start":234.699,"stop":250.941,"duration":16.24},{"text":"Section 3001(e)(2) also has no application to a wide range of advertising, including all the methods of advertising that appellee itself has used so successfully for so long.","start":250.941,"stop":266.562,"duration":15.62},{"text":"It does not have any application to advertising that does not use the mail, and it does not have any application to much advertising that does.","start":266.562,"stop":275.481,"duration":8.92},{"text":"For example, it does not apply to advertisements in magazines or other publications that are sent through the mail so long as the recipient has indicated a desire to receive the publication.","start":275.481,"stop":287.066,"duration":11.58},{"text":"And it has no application even to unsolicited advertising that is mailed to persons with a professional interest in contraception such as physicians and pharmacists and dealers.","start":287.066,"stop":300.39,"duration":13.32},{"text":"These people, of course, particularly physicians and pharmacists, can counsel and advise others on the use of contraception.","start":300.39,"stop":307.889,"duration":7.5},{"text":"But most important, Section 3001(e)(2) does not prevent any person from receiving any of appellee's mailings if appellee only obtains his consent, and appellee can even use the mail in an effort to obtain his consent, because Section 3001(e)(2) as interpreted by the Postal Service does not prohibit a premailing in which an advertiser asks a postal customer to consent to receiving a line of contraceptive advertisements.","start":307.889,"stop":342.03,"duration":34.14}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

I know the statute permits it, but supposing the statute prohibited the mailing of its promotional material by a charitable foundation or something like Planned Parenthood.","start":559.084,"stop":572.81,"duration":13.73},{"text":"Do you think Congress could constitutionally prohibit it on the same grounds, that it might fall into the hands of children?","start":572.81,"stop":579.638,"duration":6.83}]},{"speakerName":"David A.
