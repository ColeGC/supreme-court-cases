embodied in prior decisions beginning with the case of James against Dravo Contracting Company in 1937, proceeding on up through the U.S. against Fresno County case in 1977 and as recently as last year, the same principles being articulated in U.S. against Mexico.","start":404.212,"stop":429.903,"duration":25.69},{"text":"I'd like to suggest a case that illustrates the hypertechnical approach

arguing that application of the use tax to property that they brought into the state from out of state was unfair and discriminatory as far as the interstate commerce clause was concerned because it did not equate with a state retail sales tax, which of course applied to vendors and vendees in that state.","start":438.806,"stop":466.42,"duration":27.61},{"text":"One of the reasons for the complaint was the theory that the retailer might be able to absorb part of that tax, and this Court said no, that that was hypertechnical, the difference in the legal incidence in the way those taxes were applied made no constitutional difference at all.","start":466.42,"stop":485.022,"duration":18.6},{"text":"And as the Court said, there is an equal charge against what is used, whatever its source.","start":485.022,"stop":491.237,"duration":6.22},{"text":"And this is the approach we're urging on the Court to take today with regard to this hypertechnical, what we believe formalistic complaint.","start":491.237,"stop":499.298,"duration":8.06},{"text":"We're submitting the Court should construe the supremacy clause so as to protect the Federal Government against a state tax which places the Government at a competitive disadvantage in obtaining resources necessary to perform its functions, but at the same time construing the supremacy clause so as to allow the state the greatest flexibility to fashion a tax scheme that will fit our particular circumstances.","start":499.298,"stop":525.069,"duration":25.77},{"text":"We certainly acknowledge, just to lay the groundwork, that the state may not lay the incidence of a tax directly on the Federal Government.","start":525.069,"stop":533.487,"duration":8.42},{"text":"That is McColluch against Maryland, starting 160 years ago.","start":533.487,"stop":536.985,"duration":3.5},{"text":"And that is why the legal incidence of this tax was not imposed on the Government here in the State of Washington.","start":536.985,"stop":543.139,"duration":6.15},{"text":"And of course, just to make the step, this Court held that a state... it diverted from that and said that the state may impose a tax on people dealing with the Federal Government in 1937 in the James against Dravo case, and this Court held that that may occur even though the cost of that tax is passed on to the Federal Government, even though that becomes an expense of doing that business.","start":543.139,"stop":569.363,"duration":26.22},{"text":"So that brings us, I believe, to the test, the question here before the Court today: What is the test that should be applied to determine whether a tax with those dealing with the Federal Government is discriminatory under the supremacy clause?","start":569.363,"stop":584.747,"duration":15.38},{"text":"Now, the Court, as I say, indicated it was all right for a state to tax contractors dealing with the Federal Government if the same tax is imposed on all other contractors, and in so doing the Court implicitly accepted the principle that economic forces will work the same in both the federal and the nonfederal sectors.","start":584.747,"stop":604.833,"duration":20.09},{"text":"And we suggest that we can go from that case to say that they become economic burden partners in both the federal and the nonfederal sectors.","start":604.833,"stop":616.89,"duration":12.06},{"text":"By economic burden partners, we'd suggest that we have a case where parties to a transaction which is subject to a tax, where the legal incidence of the tax falls on one party or the other and the economic burden of the tax will be determined as part of the negotiations in response to market forces which would apply to those kinds of transactions at that time.","start":616.89,"stop":642.458,"duration":25.57},{"text":"So of course the question is, does this economic burden partner principle carry over to the case we're presenting to the Court today, and we believe that it does.","start":642.458,"stop":652.158,"duration":9.7},{"text":"The question is, does this principle apply when the legal incidence of a tax is on a different partner in the federal transaction than it does on the partner in the nonfederal transaction.","start":652.158,"stop":665.605,"duration":13.45}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day

Eikenberry","textObjs":[{"text":"In that sense, Your Honor, the incidence is on different partners in the transaction, but I believe we can show that it is not a discriminatory tax simply because that incidence is placed on different partners to the transaction.","start":673.585,"stop":687.644,"duration":14.06}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"How do you distinguish the Moses Lake Homes and Phillips Chemical Company cases that are relied upon by the Solicitor General?","start":687.644,"stop":697.123,"duration":9.48}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth O.
