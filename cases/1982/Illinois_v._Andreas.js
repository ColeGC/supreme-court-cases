delivered.","start":67.832,"stop":83.467,"duration":15.64},{"text":"The essential facts are as follows.","start":83.467,"stop":86.324,"duration":2.86},{"text":"On February 21st, 1979, a customs agent stationed at O'Hare International Airport inspected a shipment from Calcutta, India, to Respondent consignee.","start":86.324,"stop":98.695,"duration":12.37},{"text":"He did this in a customs bonded area.","start":98.695,"stop":101.147,"duration":2.45},{"text":"The container inspected was sheet metal, approximately four feet square and 12 to 18 inches thick.","start":101.147,"stop":109.846,"duration":8.7},{"text":"There were two locks affixed to the container, which the customs agent opened by keys which were accompanying the airline documents.","start":109.846,"stop":118.875,"duration":9.03},{"text":"Inside the container he found a table top approximately three feet in diameter and eight to ten inches thick.","start":118.875,"stop":126.637,"duration":7.76},{"text":"He removed the table from the container and drilled several holes in it, removing from inside a substance, which he field tested and found to be marijuana.","start":126.637,"stop":137.163,"duration":10.53},{"text":"He then contacted agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration.","start":137.163,"stop":140.912,"duration":3.75},{"text":"Soon thereafter DEA Agent Labek arrived at O'Hare Airport.","start":140.912,"stop":147.457,"duration":6.54},{"text":"He saw both the table and the container in the customs bonded area.","start":147.457,"stop":152.033,"duration":4.58},{"text":"He also performed his own field test on contents from the table top, which again showed marijuana.","start":152.033,"stop":159.343,"duration":7.31},{"text":"On February 22nd, the next day, DEA Agent Labek picked up the container, which had been resealed at that time, from the customs area at O'Hare.","start":159.343,"stop":171.182,"duration":11.84},{"text":"He was dressed as a delivery man and took the table and the container to 61 East Goethe Street in Chicago, Illinois, the address of Respondent given on the airline documents.","start":171.182,"stop":181.755,"duration":10.57},{"text":"There he met officers of the Chicago Police Department, including Police Officer Wayne Lipsek, who was also dressed as a delivery man.","start":181.755,"stop":190.376,"duration":8.62},{"text":"Agent Labek met an individual in the apartment building at that address who identified himself as Respondent.","start":190.376,"stop":198.124,"duration":7.75},{"text":"The two walked outside and met Officer Lipsek.","start":198.124,"stop":202.246,"duration":4.12},{"text":"While they were unloading the container from the back of the van, Respondent noted that there was a table top inside and that he had helped pack it.","start":202.246,"stop":211.961,"duration":9.72},{"text":"The three carried the container into the apartment building and took it to the second floor.","start":211.961,"stop":217.35,"duration":5.39},{"text":"Respondent directed the officers to leave the container in the hallway immediately outside his apartment.","start":217.35,"stop":223.785,"duration":6.44},{"text":"They did so.","start":223.785,"stop":225.316,"duration":1.53},{"text":"After leaving the container outside the apartment, they went around the corner and observed Respondent take the container inside the apartment.","start":225.316,"stop":234.016,"duration":8.7},{"text":"While Officer Lipsek left to obtain a state search warrant, Agent Labek maintained surveillance within the apartment building.","start":234.016,"stop":242.934,"duration":8.92},{"text":"Soon after Respondent took the container into the apartment, Agent Labek saw him come out of the apartment, go to a window in the hallway, look to the side and look down, turn and go back into the apartment.","start":242.934,"stop":259.396,"duration":16.46},{"text":"Approximately 30 to 45 minutes later, Respondent came out of the apartment with the

arrest and Agent Labek later testified that the container with Respondent at that time was the same container that had been delivered to him.","start":270.283,"stop":282.356,"duration":12.07},{"text":"Officer Lipsek was radioed and told to return to the scene.","start":282.356,"stop":287.65,"duration":5.29},{"text":"He did so, and Officer Lipsek and Agent Labek accompanied the container to Chicago police headquarters.","start":287.65,"stop":295.975,"duration":8.33},{"text":"At Chicago police headquarters the container was opened, the table top was found within, the substance was removed from within the table top and again field tested and found to be marijuana.","start":295.975,"stop":308.549,"duration":12.57},{"text":"Officer Lipsek was present during this entire process and testified that the container which was opened was the same container that had been delivered to Respondent.","start":308.549,"stop":321.34,"duration":12.79},{"text":"Respondent was charged with possession of controlled substances and with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.","start":321.34,"stop":330.257,"duration":8.92},{"text":"The trial court granted Respondent's motion to suppress evidence.","start":330.257,"stop":335.506,"duration":5.25},{"text":"The Illinois appellate court affirmed that decision.","start":335.506,"stop":337.896,"duration":2.39},{"text":"The State's petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court was denied, and this Court granted certiorari.","start":337.896,"stop":344.94,"duration":7.04},{"text":"It is the State's position that no warrant was required for the second opening of the container at police headquarters.","start":344.94,"stop":352.375,"duration":7.44},{"text":"There had been a lawful customs search which clearly established that contraband was within the container, and this knowledge was within law enforcement's area of understanding.","start":352.375,"stop":364.229,"duration":11.85},{"text":"There was then a controlled delivery of the container and its contents, during which the officers maintained reasonably continuous surveillance.","start":364.229,"stop":372.584,"duration":8.36},{"text":"Thus the second search constituted not a new search but a reassertion of control over that which the Government had already seized.","start":372.584,"stop":380.551,"duration":7.97},{"text":"This Court has for many years and in many cases held that a search at customs is reasonable by the fact that it occurs at the border.","start":380.551,"stop":392.062,"duration":11.51},{"text":"It does not require probable cause, it does not require a warrant.","start":392.062,"stop":396.402,"duration":4.34},{"text":"Thus any individual shipping a container which will cross a border has no legitimate expectation of privacy that the container will not be searched.","start":396.402,"stop":407.602,"duration":11.2},{"text":"At the time that the search took place here at customs, it was performed by a customs agent, it was performed in a customs area.","start":407.602,"stop":417.535,"duration":9.93},{"text":"It revealed contents which were contraband and field tests confirmed that it was contraband.","start":417.535,"stop":426.063,"duration":8.53},{"text":"At that stage the Government had the right to seize the container and its contents.","start":426.063,"stop":431.701,"duration":5.64},{"text":"They also had the right to conduct a controlled delivery, which they did.","start":431.701,"stop":436.183,"duration":4.48},{"text":"A controlled delivery is an accepted police activity where there is delivery by law enforcement and there is a serving of a legitimate law enforcement purpose.","start":436.183,"stop":447.898,"duration":11.72},{"text":"In this case, two purposes could be to confirm the identity of the recipient of the container and also to identify any confederates which might be involved in the criminal enterprise.","start":447.898,"stop":460.253,"duration":12.35},{"text":"Thus the seizure had taken place at the time of the initial legal search and it remained in the Government's constructive control throughout.","start":460.253,"stop":468.687,"duration":8.43},{"text":"Here there was a valid controlled delivery.","start":468.687,"stop":471.655,"duration":2.97},{"text":"Markings were not necessary on this container because it was of a distinctive type.","start":471.655,"stop":476.87,"duration":5.22},{"text":"It was a four by four metal container used for shipping, used to ship large objects.","start":476.87,"stop":483.211,"duration":6.34},{"text":"Therefore it was sufficiently distinctive that no special markings on the outside or in the interior were necessary.","start":483.211,"stop":491.036,"duration":7.82},{"text":"The law enforcement agencies involved had collective knowledge that was sufficient through the continuum of delivery here so that there was no break.","start":491.036,"stop":502.656,"duration":11.62},{"text":"All relevant actions taken from the time of the search at customs were by customs agents, Chicago police department officers, or agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration.","start":502.656,"stop":513.981,"duration":11.32},{"text":"The critical point here is the 30 to 45-minute interval during which Respondent had the container in his apartment.","start":513.981,"stop":523.148,"duration":9.17},{"text":"It is our position that this did not create any legitimate expectation of privacy on the part of Respondent in the contents of the container.","start":523.148,"stop":532.847,"duration":9.7},{"text":"The fact of possession clearly does not defeat a controlled delivery, because it takes place in almost every controlled delivery.","start":532.847,"stop":540.627,"duration":7.78},{"text":"At least for some point, the individual recipient does have the package.","start":540.627,"stop":545.843,"duration":5.22},{"text":"Constant observation of the package and the recipient are not required in a controlled delivery.","start":545.843,"stop":552.169,"duration":6.33},{"text":"Quite frequently during this process, there is transfer from one agent to another, law enforcement agency to another, by a common carrier.","start":552.169,"stop":561.18,"duration":9.01},{"text":"It is not required and it has never been required in these cases that there be continuous Government observation of the object while it is being transferred.","start":561.18,"stop":571.16,"duration":9.98}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A.

Devine","textObjs":[{"text":"I think, Your Honor, that the Court could, because of the unusual nature of the type of search which can occur at customs under the law and which can give law enforcement officials specific knowledge of the contents of the container, could take the position that once the Government finds contraband in such containers and the container is identified, even if it were a suitcase, were clearly identifiable, then Government, if it maintained reasonably continuous surveillance, could retake that container and open it up because there had been that specific knowledge and there had not been a legitimate expectation of privacy about the contents in placing it at an international border.","start":615.971,"stop":662.685,"duration":46.71}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"That would be true, following up in Justice Blackmun's question, only so long as there were probable cause to believe that whatever had been in the container was still in it.","start":662.685,"stop":673.978,"duration":11.29},{"text":"If it had been in the guy's apartment for two days and he comes out with a container, he may just be throwing it in the trash.","start":673.978,"stop":680.412,"duration":6.43}]},{"speakerName":"Richard A.
