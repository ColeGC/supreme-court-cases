Circuit Court of Appeals and presents two questions for your consideration.","start":67.38,"stop":75.814,"duration":8.43},{"text":"The first question being the interpretation of some of the provisions under Section 905(a), 905(b), and 933 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act.","start":75.814,"stop":88.075,"duration":12.26},{"text":"The second question is a question regarding major damages which was applied by the lower court and affirmed by the Third Circuit in this particular case.","start":88.075,"stop":96.728,"duration":8.65},{"text":"By way of background, the respondent was an employee of Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation.","start":96.728,"stop":103.411,"duration":6.68},{"text":"He had worked for them on the rivers, particularly on the Monongahela River for Jones & Laughlin for many years.","start":103.411,"stop":109.237,"duration":5.83},{"text":"He was entitled as having the duties of being a barge helper and barge handler.","start":109.237,"stop":116.703,"duration":7.47},{"text":"In doing so, he would go out and he would work with the barges.","start":116.703,"stop":120.014,"duration":3.31},{"text":"So that you are aware of the situation, on the Monongahela River Jones & Laughlin had two landings.","start":120.014,"stop":125.762,"duration":5.75},{"text":"The first landing had an elevator which they would take these barges, and the barges being approximately 175 feet long, 26 feet wide, under the coal elevator.","start":125.762,"stop":139.084,"duration":13.32},{"text":"This would then empty the barge as the coal goes into the metal freeze, and persons like Mr. Pfeifer would then be in charge of taking care of the fleet as the empty barges would be moved down to the other fleet.","start":139.084,"stop":153.344,"duration":14.26},{"text":"Mr. Pfeifer was injured on February 13, 1978, at which time he came out to work on the midnight shift.","start":153.344,"stop":162.701,"duration":9.36},{"text":"He did not work his normal job at that time, his normal job was a Class 7 job, but as he would do from time to time, he would come out and he worked as a headman, this was a Class 13 as far as the pay is concerned.","start":162.701,"stop":177.086,"duration":14.39},{"text":"In that position Mr. Pfeifer was in charge of two other individuals and these three individuals on that particular shift would then go out and take care of the barges.","start":177.086,"stop":188.458,"duration":11.37},{"text":"By taking care of the barges, they would make sure that the lashings were tight.","start":188.458,"stop":192.611,"duration":4.15},{"text":"If it was necessary to pump out any barges which were taking on water, this was one of their duties.","start":192.611,"stop":197.812,"duration":5.2},{"text":"Also incumbent upon Mr. Pfeifer and the people he was working with was to make sure that the gunnels, which would be the walkways on the barges, and the deck-ends where the people would walk would be free and clear of snow.","start":197.812,"stop":211.947,"duration":14.13},{"text":"As I say, Mr. Pfeifer came out to work at midnight on this particular shift, and sometime later, 3:00 a.m., or 4:00 a.m., while going out with two other individuals to pump a barge, he slipped on some ice and snow that had been accumulated on the barge and injured his back.","start":211.947,"stop":231.127,"duration":19.18},{"text":"As a result of that incident, then, Mr. Pfeifer did sign the proper forms for getting payments under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act.","start":231.127,"stop":241.451,"duration":10.32},{"text":"I think it is important for you to know as a Court that Jones & Laughlin has been paying Mr. Pfeifer for the compensation benefits as called for under this Act ever since the date of the accident.","start":241.451,"stop":252.806,"duration":11.36},{"text":"At the time of the trial in this particular case in which there was a final verdict rendered against Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation in the amount of approximately $275,000, there was a set off which was approximately $33,000 for the compensation benefits which had been made to Mr. Pfeifer as of the date of the trial.","start":252.806,"stop":276.281,"duration":23.47},{"text":"I believe it is also important for you to know that even today as I stand here arguing this case before you, we are still making payments under the Compensation Act as called for.","start":276.281,"stop":288.104,"duration":11.82},{"text":"I think this is relatively important because 905(a) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act sets forth what we refer to as the exclusivity provision, which states basically that a person injured under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act has exclusive remedies to receive compensation from the employer.","start":288.104,"stop":311.392,"duration":23.29},{"text":"This is why I pointed out that under these circumstances we have been and in fact are still paying because as Jones & Laughlin looks at and reviews the exclusivity provision, we feel that that is the only basis that an employee is to receive benefits from the employer.","start":311.392,"stop":330.634,"duration":19.24}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"That would be traditional in those workmen's

Murdoch","textObjs":[{"text":"There is in the legislation history as it appears, although the amendments to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act are still pending, they have set forth the case of Griffith versus Wheeling-Pittsburgh as being something that was not intended from the 1972 amendments.","start":382.722,"stop":399.996,"duration":17.27},{"text":"I will give you some background.","start":399.996,"stop":401.262,"duration":1.27},{"text":"In 1972, there was an amendment by 905(b), which is the section that was discussed in Edmonds and came into play.","start":401.262,"stop":410.883,"duration":9.62},{"text":"As I look at the Edmonds decision, as I look at the Griffith/Wheeling-Pittsburgh case, I feel that was done in that particular instance, though, was the failure to look at sections 905(a), 905(b), and section 933, as they are all read together.","start":410.883,"stop":428.484,"duration":17.6},{"text":"Though This Court, even as recently as last Wednesday, set forth in the case of Lockheed versus the United States that 905(a) was the exclusive remedy under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Benefit Act.","start":428.484,"stop":442.12,"duration":13.64},{"text":"As we look at 905(a), it simply says that this is the only thing that the employee is entitled to.","start":442.12,"stop":449.055,"duration":6.94},{"text":"Getting to 905(b) and looking at the legislative intent of the amendments back in 1972, as we have in most workermen's compensation areas you had the quid pro quo.","start":449.055,"stop":463.955,"duration":14.9},{"text":"You had the giving up of any rights that they might have had before the amendments to sue for unseaworthiness or to sue for indemnity in response for largely increased benefits.","start":463.955,"stop":476.231,"duration":12.28},{"text":"These benefits are taken under section 910 and they set forth that as of June 1st of each year the different values are placed on as to what the increase is going to be for the benefits, and then they are implemented in October of that particular year.","start":476.231,"stop":497.224,"duration":20.99},{"text":"So the position that we have here is that because of the 1972 amendments giving such a large increase in benefits to these longshoremen that it did away with what was the dual capacity.","start":497.224,"stop":510.186,"duration":12.96},{"text":"I think it is important that you look at 905(b) as it applies to 905(a) and 933.","start":510.186,"stop":516.887,"duration":6.7},{"text":"905(b) basically starts off by saying that any person injured under this particular Act has the benefits of this Act.","start":516.887,"stop":526.196,"duration":9.31},{"text":"I stress that it says \"any person\" because in looking at the Edmonds case there is a distinction that the Court brought or the Court intended to bring up by saying that the first sentence only applies to a longshoreman.","start":526.196,"stop":539.94,"duration":13.74},{"text":"I disagree with that because if you go one step further, it says in 905(b) if there is the right, then, to sue the vessel or vessel as a person that the employer cannot be directly or indirectly liable.","start":539.94,"stop":557.713,"duration":17.77},{"text":"So where I have the problem with Edmonds is that it did not go far enough with the language.","start":557.713,"stop":565.055,"duration":7.34},{"text":"You have 905(a) which basically says exclusively you get the benefits.","start":565.055,"stop":571.225,"duration":6.17},{"text":"The employer is not to suffer any more manner of making payments.","start":571.225,"stop":575.644,"duration":4.42},{"text":"Section 905(b) reiterates this, it says that the employer cannot be directly or indirectly liable to the injured employee on behalf of the vessel.","start":575.644,"stop":587.67,"duration":12.03},{"text":"If we look at Edmonds and we try to determine the way it was with Edmonds, then you are saying basically that the injured employee can sue the vessel, but in the same token if the vessel is owned by the employer it is literally the employer that is making the payments.","start":587.67,"stop":605.835,"duration":18.17},{"text":"So it is really a way of getting around the language as far as what 905(a) was, and it is our contention that in 905(b), as the second part of the first sentence, where it says that the employer may not be directly or indirectly liable to the employee for the vessel, then they are in fact reiterating in 905(b) the exclusivity provision that it had in 908(a).","start":605.835,"stop":635.51,"duration":29.67},{"text":"Going one step further in that same sentence in section 905(b) it does make reference that if any action can be filed by the injured employee, it would be in accordance with section 933 of the same Act.","start":635.51,"stop":651.223,"duration":15.71},{"text":"Edmonds did not address itself to that particular section.","start":651.223,"stop":655.44,"duration":4.22},{"text":"Section 933 of the Act sets forth that the injured employee, if he determines that the injuries were in fact caused by somebody other than the employer or an employee of the employer, he has the right to a third party action.","start":655.44,"stop":671.776,"duration":16.34},{"text":"So I think you have in 905(a) and 905(b) and 933, you have three distinct places where the intent of Congress was to limit any payments that the injured employee would get from the employer to solely the situation of receiving the compensation benefits.","start":671.776,"stop":693.471,"duration":21.7},{"text":"The trade-offs, as I have indicated, if you look at the legislative intent and the language which I have cited in my brief, sets forth specifically that the intent of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act was to place maritime workers in similar situations into the same situation that a land-based employee has under Workmen's Compensation.","start":693.471,"stop":717.211,"duration":23.74},{"text":"I believe the Court is well aware that in the cases where we have a State Workemen's Compensation law that the employee who is injured does in fact have the right to get the benefits.","start":717.211,"stop":728.816,"duration":11.61},{"text":"Under the Compensations Act, he had no other benefits at that time.","start":728.816,"stop":733.533,"duration":4.72},{"text":"There is nothing to preclude him, as I feel the intent of 905(b) was, to sue, let's say, the manufacturer of a machine upon which he was injured as long as it was not owned by the employer.","start":733.533,"stop":747.215,"duration":13.68},{"text":"So I think, in looking at the 1972 amendments, when you put them all together without taking them out of context, that you can see that the overall intent was simply to put these longshoremen on the same basis of land-based employees, to get only that type of benefit.","start":747.215,"stop":767.113,"duration":19.9},{"text":"Now, 905(b) does also provide that somebody who is injured, who is not an employee or not, can sue somebody who has caused the injury, but again if there is any liability or any money to be paid by the employer, then they are not going to receive payments.","start":767.113,"stop":788.792,"duration":21.68},{"text":"We had raised this contention in the pleadings.","start":788.792,"stop":792.197,"duration":3.4},{"text":"I had raised it as a motion for summary judgment in the lower court, and of course the Third Circuit looked at it, but this is the first time, I believe, that this issue has been before this Court.","start":792.197,"stop":803.067,"duration":10.87},{"text":"Although there has been discussion in Edmonds and in other cases, I do feel that what we are looking at is a situation that the intent of Congress was overwhelming to limit the recovery that the longshoremen could get.","start":803.067,"stop":818.89,"duration":15.82},{"text":"I might point out also that if we get this interpretation, and also we are looking at minimizing litigation costs, because I think if you look at the true intent then the employees who are injured will, in fact, be getting their compensation benefits which are quite high under the circumstances of this Act, and there is not going to be these types of actions which are going to take up the time of the trial courts largely.","start":818.89,"stop":845.301,"duration":26.41}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day
