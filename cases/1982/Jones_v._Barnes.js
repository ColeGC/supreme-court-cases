counsel has a strategy for effective presentation of the appeal, then the Second Circuit rule would suppress that strategy and require counsel to replace it with a laundry list brief, with a brief simply listing what may well be a large number of issues which, in counsel's judgment, would render the brief less effective rather than more.","start":527.851,"stop":552.334,"duration":24.48},{"text":"Such a list of issues which Anders, in fact, requires may be better than nothing which is what the Anders defendant would otherwise
