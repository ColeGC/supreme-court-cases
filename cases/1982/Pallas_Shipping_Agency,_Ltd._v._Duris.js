the court has stated here.","start":697.72,"stop":705.622,"duration":7.9},{"text":"But I submit to interpret that and apply it to the Act as the court did in this case, is going to do extreme violence to the scheme of the Act and if the court would view the statistics compiled by the Department of Labor, which were lodged with the court by our amicus in this cases, you will see that only in two percent of the cases are formal compensation awards entered.","start":705.622,"stop":747.308,"duration":41.69},{"text":"And that's disputed cases, and it's less than that in undisputed cases.","start":747.308,"stop":752.947,"duration":5.64},{"text":"Now, we firmly believe that Congress intended that an award and assignment be issued in every case and we point to the 1972 amendments to the Act in which Congress extensively revised Section 905(b) with respect to third party liability.","start":752.947,"stop":783.357,"duration":30.41},{"text":"And in that revision, Congress stated that the third party liability action is to be brought in","start":783.357,"stop":794.571,"duration":11.21},{"text":"\"accordance with the provisions of Section 33(b). \"","start":794.571,"stop":799.568,"duration":5},{"text":"Furthermore, the quid pro quo of the act certainly gives the employer, we contend, the right to review independently all of his cases and determine whether he wants to bring a third party action.","start":799.568,"stop":821.7,"duration":22.13},{"text":"It's also clear, we believe, that if the employer is going to lose this right, he has indeed lost a valuable right.","start":821.7,"stop":836.585,"duration":14.88},{"text":"When we look at Section 33 as a whole, because there's the election and then the assignment and then some other sections, but when we look at that as a whole, we'll find that Sections (a) and (b) of Section 33 certainly give the employee and employer both a cause of action, at least by implication, certainly to the employee.","start":836.585,"stop":867.323,"duration":30.74},{"text":"And for certain in Section, I believe it's (d), gives the employer a cause of action for recovery under the Act of his compensation loss.","start":867.323,"stop":881.569,"duration":14.25},{"text":"Now, if that is the case, then certainly this statute contemplates an assignment in each and every case.","start":881.569,"stop":896.75,"duration":15.18},{"text":"The conditional understanding that employer and employee would have consecutive rights to each third party action is implicit, we believe, in the hearings.","start":896.75,"stop":913.618,"duration":16.87},{"text":"Now, the Sixth Circuit, having said that in the case of voluntary payments there could be no assignment... no award and no assignment, thus no assignment, or no six month limitation period, realized that they had to come up with something for this poor employer, who is left with his compensation payments.","start":913.618,"stop":943.48,"duration":29.86},{"text":"And in the event the employee did not sue a third party, he had no way to recover them.","start":943.48,"stop":953.319,"duration":9.84},{"text":"So, the Sixth Circuit said, all right, we'll give him a Burnside remedy.","start":953.319,"stop":957.585,"duration":4.27},{"text":"The Burnside remedy stems from a case decided by this court back in 1969 in which a tort action was permitted to the stevedore in order to permit him to recover other than under Section 33 of the Act.","start":957.585,"stop":975.608,"duration":18.02},{"text":"So, they came up with this Burnside remedy, injected it into the case, and said Mr. Employer, you've got your remedy, while we, on the petitioner's side, question the existence or nonexistence, whether the existence or nonexistence of this nonstatutory cause of action is relevant to these proceedings.","start":975.608,"stop":1006.72,"duration":31.11},{"text":"Nevertheless, certainly the viability of Burnside today is extremely questionable in view, again, of the extensive revision to Section 905(b), third party liability Section of the Act with its exclusivity language.","start":1006.72,"stop":1028.555,"duration":21.84},{"text":"Furthermore, I find it extremely hard to rationalize, in my mind, that any employer today would want a tort-only cause of action for recovery of his compensation loss or other damages in which he would be subjected to the possibility, at least, will he be subjected to the proportional fault recovery in the case, and possibly no recovery.","start":1028.555,"stop":1065.602,"duration":37.05},{"text":"Next, the Sixth Circuit in Duris hit on the controversion issue, which I was discussing a few moments ago with Justice O'Connor.","start":1065.602,"stop":1083.142,"duration":17.54},{"text":"The court expressed the view, with respect to controversion that by the employer controverting the claim, that it would bring the employee into contact with the statutes which would, in turn, make the employee aware of the assignment provision and then, in view of its previous statement, which I quoted earlier, indicated that the only true way in which an award could be obtained in a 33(b) action would be via contravention.","start":1083.142,"stop":1133.839,"duration":50.7},{"text":"We suggest that the Sixth's Circuit's reasoning is faulty.","start":1133.839,"stop":1138.448,"duration":4.61},{"text":"Certainly the regulations contemplate the informal administration of this Act and to minimize contravention and/or hearings which would be held as a result thereof.","start":1138.448,"stop":1158.502,"duration":20.05},{"text":"What, I think, the court neglected to consider is that when you controvert a claim, you controvert the right to receive compensation and under the Act, Section 14 and Section 19, in order... well, both provide that this will happen early on in the handling of any particular case within 14 days under Section 14 and within 14 days under Section 19.","start":1158.502,"stop":1198.955,"duration":40.45},{"text":"But, in any event, if you controvert, it's going to happen early on in the case.","start":1198.955,"stop":1204.906,"duration":5.95},{"text":"It will admittedly result in a hearing and award.","start":1204.906,"stop":1210.138,"duration":5.23},{"text":"Now, how controversion is going to make the employee cognizant of his rights under the statutes and, in particular, his rights under the assignment provision, is certainly a mystery to me.","start":1210.138,"stop":1231.332,"duration":21.19},{"text":"The smooth operation of the act, we submit, should not call for contravention by the employer on each and every case in order to obtain this award and, indeed, as I suggested previously, we feel it may be highly improper.","start":1231.332,"stop":1254.182,"duration":22.85},{"text":"Next, the court considered the conflict of interest question and pointed to the disincentive on the part of the employer to bring suit under the Act.","start":1254.182,"stop":1273.581,"duration":19.4},{"text":"The Sixth Circuit stated","start":1273.581,"stop":1275.97,"duration":2.39},{"text":"\"this conflict of interest problem makes us hesitate to countenance any interpretation of the Act which would expand the assignment provision of Section 33. \"","start":1275.97,"stop":1291.324,"duration":15.35},{"text":"We submit that the underlying reason given by the court, mainly conflict of interest, will not legally Justify its conclusion with respect to an expanded interpretation.","start":1291.324,"stop":1311.831,"duration":20.51},{"text":"This court considered an identical argument, conflict of interests, business relationship, in its recent decision in Rodriguez and rejected it.","start":1311.831,"stop":1329.652,"duration":17.82},{"text":"We submit that the Sixth Circuit's reasoning in the Duris opinion simply cannot be sustained on sound legal principles.","start":1329.652,"stop":1343.411,"duration":13.76},{"text":"I'd like, at this point, to discuss, for a short time, the history of the
