Procedure.","start":91.698,"stop":120.312,"duration":28.61},{"text":"Several issues were litigated below, but we confined our petition for certiorari to a single issue, not because we agree with the Court of Appeals' decision regarding all of the other issues, but because we wanted to present the Court with the issue of greatest importance administratively and the issue that reflects a long-standing practice of many years in the issuance of Rule 6(e) orders by district courts.","start":120.312,"stop":158.717,"duration":38.41},{"text":"The case arises out of a special grand jury investigation of commodity futures trading transactions before the Chicago Board of Trade.","start":158.717,"stop":172.603,"duration":13.89},{"text":"The grand jury was investigating related criminal

deducted in preparing his tax return, and yet he recovered most of those losses in the form of cash kickbacks from his trading partners.","start":200.857,"stop":245.526,"duration":44.67},{"text":"So, the guilty plea was based on a theory of violations that have implications for tax purposes.","start":245.526,"stop":254.881,"duration":9.35},{"text":"After some preliminary proceedings which are not

the grand jury and the United States Attorney in analyzing the evidence that was being secured.","start":391.076,"stop":425.859,"duration":34.78},{"text":"And, no use for any other purpose was
