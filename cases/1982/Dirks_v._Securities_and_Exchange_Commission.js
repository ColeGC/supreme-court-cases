Court:","start":11.602,"stop":15.274,"duration":3.67},{"text":"Ten years ago today, in fact virtually at this hour, Petitioner Dirks was in the office of Stanley Goldblum, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of then high flying Equity Funding Corporation of America.","start":15.274,"stop":31.016,"duration":15.74},{"text":"Justice White, it was at 10:00 in the morning, California time.","start":31.016,"stop":34.936,"duration":3.92},{"text":"[Laughter]","start":34.936,"stop":38.527,"duration":3.59},{"text":"Mr. Dirks was there to confront Mr. Goldblum with uncorroborated allegations of a former officer... a fired former officer of a subsidiary to the effect in relevant part that the major foundations of the company, its life insurance subsidiary, were a fraud and that the company was carrying on its books substantial amounts of \"phony policies\" which were being sold to reinsurers as though they were real in a Ponzi scheme.","start":38.527,"stop":76.185,"duration":37.66},{"text":"Mr. Goldblum, of course, denied all, arranged for a meeting which lasted much of the day with all of the other major officers of the company in an endeavor to persuade Mr. Dirks that these allegations were entirely spurious and were being circulated by a disgruntled former fired employee who, although Mr. Dirks hadn't mentioned his name, Mr. Goldblum knew who it was.","start":76.185,"stop":104.268,"duration":28.08},{"text":"Secrist had come to Dirks ten days earlier with these and other allegations, some of which ultimately proved to be true, some of which proved to be false.","start":104.268,"stop":113.156,"duration":8.89},{"text":"He had come to Dirks because Dirks had a reputation as an analyst who was willing to investigate beyond just looking at reports, the bottom line financial analysis, because as the Court of Appeal below found the Securities and Exchange Commission had a history of failing to act promptly in dealing with what has come to be known as the Equity Funding Scandal, the SEC having been informed by one of its own former attorneys a year and a half earlier and having taken essentially no action, a quick investigation which was closed.","start":113.156,"stop":147.14,"duration":33.98},{"text":"The SEC again being informed within two days of Mr. Dirks, but again concluding that there was nothing there and not taking any action at that time.","start":147.14,"stop":156.105,"duration":8.97},{"text":"Secrist had the idea that in view of the performance by the regulators and in view of the notion within the company that the company had connections through its associate general counsel to the SEC, which made it clear that the SEC would never act, and through its vice president of the Illinois Insurance Commission, which also assured that the Insurance Commission which had regulatory authority would never act, the only way to public's eyes what Secrist believed, though, as he admitted he had no proof, was a major, perhaps the major fraud in corporate America at the time was to have somebody like Dirks go out, do such investigation as he could and to publicize those allegations in the only way a securities analyst can by telling everybody he can get his hands on with the result that the trading in the stock would cause an adjustment in the price--","start":156.105,"stop":214.551,"duration":58.45}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Bonderman, we are dealing here, I guess, only with the activities of Mr. Dirks

time.","start":289.098,"stop":306.42,"duration":17.32},{"text":"In fact, Stanley Sporkin, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement at the time, who was called
