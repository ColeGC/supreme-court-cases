New Hampshire.","start":66.858,"stop":81.135,"duration":14.28},{"text":"The theory below was that for the contraband nature of that balloon to have been \"immediately apparent\" to the officer as required by Coolidge, the officer had to know what was inside the balloon.","start":81.135,"stop":95.628,"duration":14.49},{"text":"And in the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals, because this balloon was opaque, the officer obviously could not see inside the balloon and could not have known what was inside.","start":95.628,"stop":105.667,"duration":10.04},{"text":"Therefore, they found the seizure to be improper.","start":105.667,"stop":108.452,"duration":2.78},{"text":"The State of Texas filed a motion for rehearing or a request for rehearing, but that motion for leave to file was denied by the en banc court, three of those nine judges filing a written dissent to that.","start":108.452,"stop":123.362,"duration":14.91},{"text":"It was the belief of these dissenters that probable cause, not knowledge, was the standard to which the seizing officer was held, and that when proper regard was given to the inferences that this experienced officer was able to draw when he saw the balloon, probable cause was evident, and the seizure was proper.","start":123.362,"stop":141.407,"duration":18.05},{"text":"To amplify on the facts of the seizure, on June 18th, 1979, Fort Worth police officer Tom Maples and other members of the Patrol Division had set up a roadblock-type of driver's license check.","start":141.407,"stop":157.035,"duration":15.63},{"text":"They were checking, stopping each vehicle that came through this roadblock, checking the drivers for driver's licenses and checking the vehicles for expired inspection stickers or registration and license plate violations.","start":157.035,"stop":171.962,"duration":14.93},{"text":"They were not checking the drivers for outstanding warrants.","start":171.962,"stop":175.164,"duration":3.2},{"text":"They were not looking for any particular individual.","start":175.164,"stop":177.866,"duration":2.7},{"text":"They did not have any members of the narcotics detail with them.","start":177.866,"stop":181.234,"duration":3.37},{"text":"It happened to be Officer Maples who stopped respondent's vehicle when he came through this checkpoint.","start":181.234,"stop":187.637,"duration":6.4},{"text":"When Officer Maples asked the respondent to exhibit a driver's license, the respondent reached in his right front pants pocket, fumbled around in that pocket long enough to alarm the officer, and caused him to shine his flashlight into the car, this incident having occurred around 11:00 to 11:15 at night, and when the respondent withdrew his hand from that pants pocket, the officer could see him holding two items.","start":187.637,"stop":214.289,"duration":26.65},{"text":"Between his thumb and index finger he was holding a folded dollar bill, but between his two middle fingers where I've placed this box, he was holding a small, green, knotted, opaque, tied-off balloon.","start":214.289,"stop":229.314,"duration":15.03},{"text":"The officer described it as being tied about a half inch from the end, and when mashed down it was approximately one-eight of an inch thick.","start":229.314,"stop":237.32,"duration":8.01},{"text":"The officer then saw the respondent drop this balloon alongside his leg onto the car seat.","start":237.32,"stop":243.908,"duration":6.59},{"text":"The respondent reached over and opened the glove box of the vehicle, presumably still trying to find the driver's license.","start":243.908,"stop":250.712,"duration":6.8},{"text":"The light in that box came on, and inside there the officer could see several items.","start":250.712,"stop":256.116,"duration":5.4},{"text":"He saw what he described as a lot of loose white powder, a bag of balloons apparently just as they had come from the store, several small, empty plastic vials.","start":256.116,"stop":268.189,"duration":12.07},{"text":"The officer, having been experienced in this sort of thing, formed the conclusion that there was some sort of narcotic substance in that green balloon he had first seen, so he asked the respondent to step from the car and move to the rear of the vehicle, which respondent did closing the door behind him.","start":268.189,"stop":284.615,"duration":16.43},{"text":"The officer could then see inside the vehicle still, saw the green balloon on the car seat where the respondent dropped it, and he reached in and picked up the balloon, noticing at that time that it contained some sort of powdery substance inside.","start":284.615,"stop":298.542,"duration":13.93},{"text":"The record also shows that this officer was a five-year veteran of the police department.","start":298.542,"stop":303.696,"duration":5.15},{"text":"He had taken part in several arrests where such balloons had been seized and found to contain narcotics.","start":303.696,"stop":309.766,"duration":6.07},{"text":"He had made one such arrest himself in the previous year in which eight or nine such balloons had been recovered.","start":309.766,"stop":315.42,"duration":5.65},{"text":"He had talked with his fellow officers about the fact that narcotics were often packaged this way.","start":315.42,"stop":320.722,"duration":5.3},{"text":"He had talked with drug users about the use of milk sugar, which is apparently what this loose powder was.","start":320.722,"stop":327.561,"duration":6.84},{"text":"He knew from his experience what those empty plastic vials could have been put to.","start":327.561,"stop":332.263,"duration":4.7},{"text":"And it was based on this, the circumstances of seeing this balloon and his experience with the narcotics trade, that caused him to believe the balloon contained narcotics, caused him to seize it, and caused him then to place respondent under arrest for possession of a controlled substance.","start":332.263,"stop":348.475,"duration":16.21}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.
