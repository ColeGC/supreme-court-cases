deaf.","start":148.848,"stop":158.936,"duration":10.09},{"text":"Some background will establish the context for the specific facts and the narrow legal issue that is before the Court.","start":158.936,"stop":168.781,"duration":9.84},{"text":"Without visual aids, most deaf persons cannot understand the sound part of television.","start":168.781,"stop":176.297,"duration":7.52},{"text":"Government agencies and broadcasters have been working for more than a decade on ways to provide the deaf with suitable access to the sound part of television.","start":176.297,"stop":188.615,"duration":12.32},{"text":"Until early 1980, there were essentially two kinds of special visual aids that could help the deaf.","start":188.615,"stop":198.259,"duration":9.64},{"text":"One was sign language interpretation.","start":198.259,"stop":201.482,"duration":3.22},{"text":"The other was so-called open

sets.","start":205.515,"stop":212.251,"duration":6.74},{"text":"Because they are distracting and block part of the visual picture, both impact adversely on television service for the non-deaf majority.","start":212.251,"stop":225.167,"duration":12.92},{"text":"Competing technologies to produce captions visible only to the deaf reached the developmental stage in the early 1970's, and have been evolving.","start":225.167,"stop":237.716,"duration":12.55},{"text":"This is so-called closed captioning.","start":237.716,"stop":241.72,"duration":4},{"text":"One system reached the marketplace in 1980.","start":241.72,"stop":245.18,"duration":3.46},{"text":"The other is not as far along, but it may offer more benefits in the long run.","start":245.18,"stop":252.266,"duration":7.09},{"text":"Basically, both involve transmission of specially encoded signals that will produce captions only on television sets that have special decoding mechanisms.","start":252.266,"stop":265.496,"duration":13.23},{"text":"Producing captions that fit the visual action is a sophisticated process involving skilled personnel and special equipment.","start":265.496,"stop":276.242,"duration":10.75},{"text":"It is far more complex than flashing a tornado warning across the bottom of the screen.","start":276.242,"stop":283.678,"duration":7.44},{"text":"Some programs are not suited to captions at all, and caption is expensive, about $2,500 an hour, and public television's historic budget crunch has grown much worse lately.","start":283.678,"stop":298.638,"duration":14.96},{"text":"Despite these difficult problems, great strides have been made.","start":298.638,"stop":303.21,"duration":4.57},{"text":"Due to a combination of available approaches, deaf viewers throughout the country today have access to the sound part of many hours of television each week on both commercial and public stations.","start":303.21,"stop":318.46,"duration":15.25},{"text":"Now, this case comes to the Court on a record that covers KCET's 1974 to 1977 license term.","start":318.46,"stop":328.896,"duration":10.44},{"text":"This was long before closed captioning was in being.","start":328.896,"stop":333.18,"duration":4.28},{"text":"Nevertheless, KCET had presented nearly 1,000 programs with special visual aids during that license term.","start":333.18,"stop":343.225,"duration":10.05},{"text":"The Respondents requested the FCC to deny KCET's license renewal.","start":343.225,"stop":349.95,"duration":6.72},{"text":"They claimed that KCET's programs for the deaf were not enough, and had not been presented in peak viewing hours.","start":349.95,"stop":358.916,"duration":8.97},{"text":"Respondents focused on the comparatively new Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that prohibits discrimination against handicapped persons by recipients of federal financial assistance.","start":358.916,"stop":377.088,"duration":18.17},{"text":"Respondents requested the FCC to use its license renewal processes to force KCET to provide more of the special services they believe that Section 504 required.","start":377.088,"stop":392.996,"duration":15.91},{"text":"Three points made by the FCC in denying Respondents' complaint merit emphasis here.","start":392.996,"stop":399.742,"duration":6.75},{"text":"First, the FCC found that KCET had offered special broadcasts for the deaf, and had not abused its discretion in scheduling them.","start":399.742,"stop":412,"duration":12.26},{"text":"The only specific claims of KCET shortcomings were thus found baseless.","start":412,"stop":419.545,"duration":7.55},{"text":"Second, the FCC reviewed the many steps it had taken under the general public interest standard of the Communications Act concerning television for the deaf, and some of these predated enactment of Section 504.","start":419.545,"stop":436.477,"duration":16.93},{"text":"Third, the FCC concluded that it lacked Section 504 enforcement duties, because it did not dispense public funds.","start":436.477,"stop":446.763,"duration":10.29},{"text":"The FCC deferred to the funding agencies to decide complaints of Section 504 violations, but the FCC made very clear that any finding of a Section 504 violation by KCET would be given weight.","start":446.763,"stop":464.114,"duration":17.35},{"text":"Meanwhile, the Respondents went elsewhere.","start":464.114,"stop":466.655,"duration":2.54},{"text":"They filed a complaint against KCET at what is now the Department of Education, one of the funding agencies.","start":466.655,"stop":474.311,"duration":7.66},{"text":"They also brought a class action against KCET in District Court.","start":474.311,"stop":479.103,"duration":4.79},{"text":"Both complaints charged Section 504 discrimination, and both were eventually resolved in KCET's favor.","start":479.103,"stop":489.311,"duration":10.21},{"text":"The Respondents then appealed the FCC's denial of their complaint.","start":489.311,"stop":494.104,"duration":4.79},{"text":"A panel of the D.C. Circuit, speaking through Judge Wright, with Judge McGowan dissenting, reversed the FCC.","start":494.104,"stop":503.54,"duration":9.44},{"text":"Its decision ignored the extensive record evidence of KCET's service to the deaf, as well as the FCC's conclusions about it.","start":503.54,"stop":513.217,"duration":9.68},{"text":"We ask this Court to reverse the D.C. Circuit.","start":513.217,"stop":517.168,"duration":3.95},{"text":"The sole basis for the D.C. Circuit's decision was its belief that Section 504 expressed such a strong national policy in favor of the deaf that the FCC had to read the public interest standard in the Communications Act as if it incorporated the policy of Section 504.","start":517.168,"stop":542.337,"duration":25.17},{"text":"The FCC thus was ordered independently to decide KCET's Section 504 compliance as part of the license renewal proceedings at the FCC.","start":542.337,"stop":555.442,"duration":13.11},{"text":"The narrow issue this Court agreed to review is whether that novel incorporation theory is a legally correct interpretation of the intent of Congress.","start":555.442,"stop":567.711,"duration":12.27},{"text":"We say it is not.","start":567.711,"stop":570.052,"duration":2.34},{"text":"The mandatory incorporation theory is at war with this Court's holding that the FCC has very broad discretion to decide the scope of the public interest standard.","start":570.052,"stop":582.621,"duration":12.57},{"text":"We have found no holding by this Court suggesting that the FCC must automatically read into the public interest standard policies expressed by the Congress in other statutes.","start":582.621,"stop":596.64,"duration":14.02},{"text":"The FCC is not required to incorporate the policy of another law unless the Congress directs it.","start":596.64,"stop":605.335,"duration":8.7},{"text":"Of course, the FCC may and often does consider the policies of other statutes when it determines the scope of the public interest standard in the Communications Act, but that is an initial judgment that the Congress entrusted to the FCC.","start":605.335,"stop":623.989,"duration":18.65},{"text":"The FCC exhibited leadership concerning television for the deaf.","start":623.989,"stop":629.723,"duration":5.73},{"text":"The Court of Appeals acted as if the FCC had done nothing.","start":629.723,"stop":633.935,"duration":4.21}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
