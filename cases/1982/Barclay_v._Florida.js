Nabrit, III","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I represent the petitioner, Elwood Barclay, who is here on a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida which on direct appeal affirmed his murder conviction and a death sentence.","start":50.355,"stop":66.692,"duration":16.34},{"text":"The death sentence was imposed by a judge of the Circuit Court of Duval County who entered written sentencing findings that are the focus of our argument here today.","start":66.692,"stop":77.047,"duration":10.36},{"text":"The judge disregarded an advisory jury verdict which recommended that Barclay be given life imprisonment, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed.","start":77.047,"stop":86.653,"duration":9.61},{"text":"Barclay lost by a four-to-two vote, and his rehearing petition was denied by an equally divided court.","start":86.653,"stop":93.807,"duration":7.15},{"text":"Petitioner brought the case here on certiorari, and the state filed a brief agreeing that this Court should review the case.","start":93.807,"stop":102.6,"duration":8.79},{"text":"Now, let me begin my statement of the case before I describe the proceedings in the court below by briefly recounting five points about the Florida death sentencing statute.","start":102.6,"stop":117.297,"duration":14.7},{"text":"It is a statute that has been in this Court before.","start":117.297,"stop":120.233,"duration":2.94},{"text":"It was the statute approved in the Proffit case, and it was presented as having five procedural safeguards.","start":120.233,"stop":128.261,"duration":8.03},{"text":"First, a requirement that the death sentence be based on specific written findings about aggravating circumstances, which was supposed to serve as a guide for the sentencer's discretion.","start":128.261,"stop":140.522,"duration":12.26},{"text":"Second, the statute says that the list of aggravating circumstances is limited to eight factors, which are listed in the statute, and six of those I will just refer to in a moment are involved in this case.","start":140.522,"stop":155.39,"duration":14.87},{"text":"Second, the statute provided for an automatic appeal, a review in which the Florida Supreme Court is supposed to keep the sentencing decisions under the statute in line with the statute.","start":155.39,"stop":168.885,"duration":13.5},{"text":"Next, the jury had a special role.","start":168.885,"stop":172.353,"duration":3.47},{"text":"Although it is called advisory, the jury... the jury's judgment is supposed to prevail under the Florida law unless no reasonable mind could disagree that the death sentence should be imposed, so that it is... and finally, the idea that both the judge and jury will make a judgment both about the sufficiency of the aggravating circumstances to justify a death sentence as well as a weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.","start":172.353,"stop":208.228,"duration":35.88},{"text":"So, in summary, in the Proffit case, the Court said that after a verdict of guilt, there would be what this Court referred to as an informed, focused, guided, and objective inquiry into the question of whether a death sentence should be imposed, and that would be at... that kind of objective inquiry, at both the trial and appellate levels.","start":208.228,"stop":229.206,"duration":20.98},{"text":"Now, in Barclay's case, Barclay was found guilty in March of 1975, along with a co-defendant Dougan.","start":229.206,"stop":240.075,"duration":10.87},{"text":"He was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of one Stephen Orlando, and two other co-defendants were convicted by the same jury of second-degree murder.","start":240.075,"stop":249.837,"duration":9.76},{"text":"After the conviction, at the penalty trial, the jury recommended a death sentence for the co-defendant Dougan, but life imprisonment for Barclay.","start":249.837,"stop":263.411,"duration":13.57},{"text":"And in the penalty hearing, the state argued for only one of the eight statutory aggravating circumstances, that the crime was heinous atrocious, and cruel, yet the state made no effort at that penalty trial to convince the jury that any of the other seven circumstances applied.","start":263.411,"stop":284.276,"duration":20.87},{"text":"And the majority of the jury came back with a written finding, a written finding that sufficient aggravating circumstances did not exist to justify a death sentence, and a written finding that sufficient mitigating circumstances do exist which outweigh any aggravating circumstances.","start":284.276,"stop":303.644,"duration":19.37},{"text":"The judge discharged the jury and directed a pre-sentence investigation report, and a month later entered his own written findings, and five years later, in 1980, the judge substantially repeated the findings when he reimposed the sentence after it was first vacated on the basis of Gardner against Florida.","start":303.644,"stop":328.898,"duration":25.25},{"text":"And the judge found seven aggravating circumstances.","start":328.898,"stop":333.663,"duration":4.76},{"text":"Now, let me review some of them.","start":333.663,"stop":336.803,"duration":3.14},{"text":"The first one is quoted in our brief at Pages 29 and 30, and in this one... this is at the bottom of Page 29 and the bottom of Page 30.","start":336.803,"stop":352.622,"duration":15.82},{"text":"In this one the judge found as an aggravating circumstance that Barclay had some prior arrests, and he had a prior conviction for forgery and for breaking and entering.","start":352.622,"stop":364.118,"duration":11.5},{"text":"Now, it is acknowledged by the state that this was an error, and the reason is that what the judge found here was the absence of one of the statutory mitigating circumstances, and it is acknowledged as a matter of state law, it is acknowledged at Page 26, I think, of the state's brief, that under the state's Mikenas case, which the state cites, that it is not correct to make the absence of mitigating circumstances an aggravating circumstance, so that that was a finding that is a non-statutory finding.","start":364.118,"stop":409.71,"duration":45.59},{"text":"It is a finding of an aggravating circumstance that is not listed in the statute.","start":409.71,"stop":414.942,"duration":5.23},{"text":"There are two more points about that.","start":414.942,"stop":419.176,"duration":4.23},{"text":"One is that mere arrests under... and again, I am referring to Florida law really as a predicate for the federal arguments that I'll make later, but I am merely trying to be descriptive.","start":419.176,"stop":430.796,"duration":11.62},{"text":"Under the Florida law, the mere arrests don't qualify as convictions, even if there is a relevant crime involved, a violent crime under one of the other subsections, and convictions can't be proved by the presentence investigation report.","start":430.796,"stop":446.569,"duration":15.77},{"text":"They have to be proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt at the penalty trial.","start":446.569,"stop":453.145,"duration":6.58},{"text":"Now, turning to the next two aggravating circumstances found by the court, and these appear in our brief at the bottom of Page 33 is one, and the next one is over at Page 36, both of these are equally flawed.","start":453.145,"stop":482.273,"duration":29.13},{"text":"The first one has to do with whether or not the defendant was under a sentence of imprisonment at the time of the murder, and it is undisputed that Barclay at the time of the murder, Barclay was not in prison, he was not supposed to be in prison, he was not on parole, he was not on probation, none of that.","start":482.273,"stop":499.798,"duration":17.52},{"text":"The judge found that he was not imprisoned at the top of Page 34, but he said the criminal record was an aggravating circumstance.","start":499.798,"stop":508.186,"duration":8.39},{"text":"So what the judge did here again was to take a past criminal record and say that it was something like, it resembled the statutory aggravating circumstance.","start":508.186,"stop":518.806,"duration":10.62},{"text":"The judge did something similar with the next one, at Page 36.","start":518.806,"stop":526.286,"duration":7.48},{"text":"He said that... This provision is whether or not the defendant had been convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person, and there was nothing like that in Barclay's record, but the judge said that, well, he had been convicted of breaking and entering, and the judge said, it is not known if that prior felony involved the use or threat of violence, but he said, however, such crime can and often does involve violence.","start":526.286,"stop":558.914,"duration":32.63},{"text":"So, again, he found something really not in terms of the statute, but he said, well, it is something like the statute, so that we have three findings by the Court which really aren't in terms of the statute.","start":558.914,"stop":574.845,"duration":15.93},{"text":"The judge said, well, I am finding something that resembles the statute.","start":574.845,"stop":578.376,"duration":3.53},{"text":"Now, the fourth one is whether or not there is... the murder created a great risk of death to many persons.","start":578.376,"stop":591.121,"duration":12.75},{"text":"And this one is discussed in our brief beginning over at Page 40, and the judge found that... the judges words,","start":591.121,"stop":601.491,"duration":10.37},{"text":"\"Before, during, and after the murder. \"","start":601.491,"stop":603.427,"duration":1.94},{"text":"the judge said,","start":603.427,"stop":604.255,"duration":0.83},{"text":"\"there was a great risk of death to many persons. \"","start":604.255,"stop":607.02,"duration":2.76},{"text":"He based it on... he's got a before and an after, but he doesn't have a during in there.","start":607.02,"stop":615.861,"duration":8.84},{"text":"Before, he said, the defendants drove around looking for a victim, and it is undisputed that the victim was killed in a deserted, lonely road, and that there was no one else around, but the judge found that there was a great risk of death to many persons based on the fact that before finding a victim in a lonely, deserted spot, they looked at and decided not to attack people in groups in other parts of the city.","start":615.861,"stop":642.724,"duration":26.86},{"text":"It is a line of reasoning that--","start":642.724,"stop":648.597,"duration":5.87}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
