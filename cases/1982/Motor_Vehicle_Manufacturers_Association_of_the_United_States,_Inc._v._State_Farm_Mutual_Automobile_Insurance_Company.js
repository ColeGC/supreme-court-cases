terms.","start":17.584,"stop":34.843,"duration":17.26},{"text":"Over the 17 years since that statute was enacted, a succession of Transportation Secretaries have tried to find the best way to implement its broad authority.","start":34.843,"stop":46.479,"duration":11.64},{"text":"The optimum solution to the problem of occupant crash protection has been particularly elusive.","start":46.479,"stop":53.946,"duration":7.47},{"text":"Since 1967 standard 208, which deals with the problem of occupant crash protection, has required the installation of manual seatbelts.","start":53.946,"stop":64.392,"duration":10.45},{"text":"Passive restraints, which require no independent occupant action for their effectiveness, were first incorporated into standard 208 in a series of amendments adopted between 1970 and 1972.","start":64.392,"stop":76.669,"duration":12.28},{"text":"One of the permitted options under those amendments was a manual belt system coupled with an ignition interlock.","start":76.669,"stop":84.37,"duration":7.7},{"text":"However, public irritation with interlock systems led Congress in 1974 to prohibit them by statute.","start":84.37,"stop":91.163,"duration":6.79},{"text":"In 1976 Secretary Coleman attempted to deal with what he considered to be the root of the problem: widespread public resistance to mandatory passive restraints.","start":91.163,"stop":104.113,"duration":12.95},{"text":"He proposed a demonstration project involving up to 500,000 cars installed with passive restraints in order to smooth the way for their public acceptance at a later date.","start":104.113,"stop":115.858,"duration":11.75},{"text":"Secretary Coleman did not reject mandatory passive restraints as a long-range solution.","start":115.858,"stop":121.294,"duration":5.44},{"text":"He simply concluded that they would be more effective if preceded in time by an effort to change the public's attitude about them.","start":121.294,"stop":130.244,"duration":8.95},{"text":"His successor disagreed, as was, in our view, his prerogative.","start":130.244,"stop":134.677,"duration":4.43},{"text":"Within a manner of months, Secretary Adams dispensed with the Coleman demonstration project and instead adopted the modified standard 208 at issue here, which made passive restraints mandatory for large cars beginning with the 1982 model year and all cars beginning with the 1984 model year.","start":134.677,"stop":154.124,"duration":19.45},{"text":"While it permitted manufacturers to choose between two basic systems, air bags or passive belts, it was assumed at that time that about 60 percent of the cars would be equipped with air bags.","start":154.124,"stop":166.759,"duration":12.63},{"text":"Four years after the Adams decision, Secretary Lewis rescinded the mandatory passive restraint features of standard 208.","start":166.759,"stop":175.022,"duration":8.26},{"text":"He based his decisions on three findings:","start":175.022,"stop":177.413,"duration":2.39},{"text":"First, that because of the intervening to small cars, not one percent... not 60 percent, but only one percent of all cars would be equipped with air bags;--","start":177.413,"stop":189.095,"duration":11.68},{"text":"Second, that in complying then with standard 208 as it then stood, the seat belts that would be installed in the overwhelming majority of new cars would be detachable, and that once detached would be the functional equivalent of manual belts;--","start":189.095,"stop":205.306,"duration":16.21},{"text":"And third, that there was substantial uncertainty about the usage rate of these detachable belts convertible to manual belts.","start":205.306,"stop":214.661,"duration":9.35},{"text":"Under those circumstances, NHTSA could not reliably predict whether increased use because of detachable belts would fall closer to zero percent or closer to five percent or ten percent, and for those reasons, together with the possible adverse safety effects from public reaction to what the public might perceive to be another expensive example of ineffective regulation, the agency could not conclude that the automatic restraints as then stated met the need for safety.","start":214.661,"stop":244.226,"duration":29.57},{"text":"The Court of Appeals took no issue with the first two of these findings.","start":244.226,"stop":249.429,"duration":5.2},{"text":"It described them as reasonable.","start":249.429,"stop":250.977,"duration":1.55},{"text":"But it said that the third step turned the question on its head.","start":250.977,"stop":255.348,"duration":4.37},{"text":"The court conceded the factual issue of probable seat belt usage was one which no one could predict with certainty.","start":255.348,"stop":263.752,"duration":8.4},{"text":"Nevertheless, it held that once the agency had selected the passive restraint course of action in 1977, the presumption no longer ran in favor of the agency judgment, but rather in favor of the very regulation which the agency had concluded did not meet the statutory objectives.","start":263.752,"stop":286.524,"duration":22.77},{"text":"The effect of this unprecedented holding is truly starting.","start":286.524,"stop":293.006,"duration":6.48},{"text":"It effectively deprives an administrative agency of its authority to regulate in conditions of uncertainty by making predictive judgments to resolve that uncertainty, judgments which in many cases, including this one, lie at the very heart of the administrative process.","start":293.006,"stop":314.027,"duration":21.02},{"text":"By definition, where predictive judgments must be made in uncertain conditions, as they must here, the location of the burden will usually be determinative.","start":314.027,"stop":326.646,"duration":12.62},{"text":"This case illustrates the mischief of shifting that burden once the agency proposes a regulation, and here is the reason why.","start":326.646,"stop":336.552,"duration":9.91},{"text":"There are several views concerning which path leads to the best occupant restraint system.","start":336.552,"stop":342.892,"duration":6.34},{"text":"Over the 17 years that Secretaries of Transportation have struggled with that problem, there have been two major, enduring, and overarching issues.","start":342.892,"stop":354.886,"duration":11.99},{"text":"The first is, how effective will the passive restraint system really be.","start":354.886,"stop":360.151,"duration":5.26},{"text":"Secretary Adams in 1977 concluded that 60 percent of all cars would be equipped with air bags under his proposal and that this would be highly effective.","start":360.151,"stop":370.567,"duration":10.42},{"text":"By 1981 the circumstances had changed dramatically.","start":370.567,"stop":373.878,"duration":3.31},{"text":"It was clear that compliance would consist of easily detachable belts, and Secretary Lewis concluded that under those new circumstance the requirements created by standard 208 as it then stood would not be effective.","start":373.878,"stop":386.905,"duration":13.03},{"text":"There has always been a second broad issue, separate and very important.","start":386.905,"stop":394.775,"duration":7.87},{"text":"And it is: Assuming that there is to be a passive restraint requirement at some point in time, which of two possible approaches should the agency emphasize first in time?","start":394.775,"stop":410.361,"duration":15.59},{"text":"Do you push ahead first with hardware requirements or do you emphasize first changes in public attitude?","start":410.361,"stop":420.625,"duration":10.26},{"text":"The right answers to those two controlling questions depend on the resolution of multiple uncertainties, technological uncertainties and behavioral uncertainties.","start":420.625,"stop":436.335,"duration":15.71},{"text":"Someone has to perform the necessary task of sorting out those uncertainties, balancing the relevant considerations on all sides, and then making a judgment concerning which alternatives ought to be pursued and in what order.","start":436.335,"stop":451.859,"duration":15.52},{"text":"It is equally clear, I submit, that that job, making predictive judgments in conditions of uncertainty, belongs to the administrative agency.","start":451.859,"stop":464.139,"duration":12.28},{"text":"Standard 208 has been in existence since 1967.","start":464.139,"stop":469.606,"duration":5.47},{"text":"It's been amended many times.","start":469.606,"stop":472.336,"duration":2.73},{"text":"After more than a decade of evolving experimental administrative efforts and continuing efforts by the Courts of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and also for the District of Columbia, there is nothing in law and nothing in common sense that suggests that that evolution should be frozen as of the 1977 amendment.","start":472.336,"stop":494.485,"duration":22.15},{"text":"In 1976 Secretary Coleman concluded that the best way to implement the statute was to attempt first to change human attitudes.","start":494.485,"stop":504.277,"duration":9.79},{"text":"Was he right?","start":504.277,"stop":505.388,"duration":1.11},{"text":"Was that the best

submit, is that the Coleman choice of alternative did not preclude Secretary Adams from choosing another alternative without first bearing the probably impossible burden of disproving the predictive assumptions underlying the Coleman decision.","start":510.586,"stop":531.281,"duration":20.69},{"text":"And for the same reason, in 1981 Secretary Lewis did not rule out the possibility of passive restraints as a long-range solution.","start":531.281,"stop":539.294,"duration":8.01},{"text":"All options are still available.","start":539.294,"stop":540.811,"duration":1.52},{"text":"All options
