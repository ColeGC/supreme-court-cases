state.","start":51.192,"stop":66.685,"duration":15.49},{"text":"The guts of that statute is simply in Section 302 which prohibit states from denying the Franchise to any person over the age of 18 who

Justice.","start":87.94,"stop":92.01,"duration":4.07},{"text":"The Oregon Constitution like that of 46 other states restricts the Franchise to those who are 21 years and older.","start":92.01,"stop":101.695,"duration":9.68},{"text":"I might add that in May 1970, the voters of Oregon overwhelmingly defeated a Constitutional Amendment which would have reduced the voting age to 19.","start":101.695,"stop":115.359,"duration":13.66},{"text":"There are some points, in the plaintiff's argument over which I think there is a little dispute and which I would like to dispose off at the outset.","start":115.359,"stop":126.123,"duration":10.76},{"text":"First that states have traditionally determined voter qualifications and that tradition was contemplated by the drafters of the Constitution in Article I, Section 2, dealing with the election of representatives and Article II, Section 1, dealing with the selection of Presidential electors, and was reaffirmed even after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was reaffirmed in the Seventeenth Amendment which deals with the election of Senators.","start":126.123,"stop":154.105,"duration":27.98},{"text":"Secondly, states certainly have a vital and legitimate interest in restricting the Franchise to responsible persons, and age is certainly a relevant criteria in determining the qualifications for voter responsibility.","start":154.105,"stop":173.777,"duration":19.67},{"text":"Thirdly, the implementation of an age classification inevitably leads to line drawing and reasonable men can certainly differ as to the precise location of that line.","start":173.777,"stop":188.922,"duration":15.15},{"text":"I think also, there are obviously outer limits, over which reasonable men would also not differ that the line was not reasonable.","start":188.922,"stop":201.101,"duration":12.18},{"text":"Fourthly, while legislative wisdom may prefer one line over another, no one can seriously argue that a minimum age of 18 or 19, or 20, or 21 is irrational, irrelevant or invidious.","start":201.101,"stop":223.225,"duration":22.12},{"text":"I think this Court could perceive a reasonable basis for any one of these choices.","start":223.225,"stop":230.132,"duration":6.91},{"text":"I think the -- the point was put very succinctly by Professor Herbert Wexler in a letter to the President which appears in the congressional record on this legislation, in which he stated and I quote, “Age is obviously not irrelevant to qualifications and since any age criterion involves the drawing of an arbitrary line, fixing the age at 21, most certainly this is not capricious.”","start":230.132,"stop":261.005,"duration":30.87},{"text":"I think that there will be considerable dispute over many issues that will follow in my argument and the Solicitor General will raise, but I think really the issue in this case boils down to one point, and it is simply this.","start":261.005,"stop":278.359,"duration":17.35},{"text":"It's whether Congress has the power to substitute its legislative preference in selecting that line for the preference of the voters of the State of Oregon.","start":278.359,"stop":290.597,"duration":12.24},{"text":"Of course, for Congress to exercise such a legislative mandate, it must look to one of the enumerated powers.","start":290.597,"stop":297.278,"duration":6.68},{"text":"The defendant concedes that the responsibility for determining voter qualifications is at least primarily vested in the states by the Constitution.","start":297.278,"stop":307.933,"duration":10.65},{"text":"The defendant rests its case on Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.","start":307.933,"stop":314.7,"duration":6.77},{"text":"I think in order to understand Section 5, we must first examine Section 1 of that Amendment.","start":314.7,"stop":323.464,"duration":8.76},{"text":"And I think the point should be made at Section 1, standing alone is not an affirmative grant of power to Congress, but rather it's merely a prohibition against the states.","start":323.464,"stop":337.66,"duration":14.2},{"text":"And this is in contrast to the enumerated powers of Congress such as Interstate Commerce that are enumerated in Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution.","start":337.66,"stop":349.841,"duration":12.18},{"text":"Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to do all that is necessary and proper to enforce the prohibition of Section 1, but the test necessarily must be whether the power exercised by Congress is appropriate to the enforcement of what is prohibited by Section 1. in Title III, Congress and the defendant have attempted to obviate this test by bootstrap reasoning.","start":349.841,"stop":384.34,"duration":34.5},{"text":"First, in Section 301 of the Act, Congress declares that requiring a citizen to be 21 years of age in order to vote is a violation of the Equal Protection Prohibition.","start":384.34,"stop":398.441,"duration":14.1},{"text":"And therefore, it is necessary and proper to enforce the prohibition by preventing the states from denying the franchise to anyone who is over 18.","start":398.441,"stop":410.172,"duration":11.73},{"text":"Secondly, defendant now asserts, the judicial review of Congress' findings is confined to the single issue of whether the Court can perceive any rational basis therefore.","start":410.172,"stop":427.776,"duration":17.6},{"text":"We concede that the perceive a basis test is the appropriate test of legislation under the necessary and proper clause embodied in Section 5.","start":427.776,"stop":440.093,"duration":12.32},{"text":"We also concede that it's a proper role for Congress to seek and identify violations of the Equal Protection Prohibition.","start":440.093,"stop":449.596,"duration":9.5},{"text":"But there is still one defective link in defendant's chain of reasoning which destroys the connection.","start":449.596,"stop":459.237,"duration":9.64},{"text":"We submit that first, that the perceive a basis test is not the appropriate test for judicial review in determining the scope and the meaning of the Equal Protection Prohibition.","start":459.237,"stop":473.196,"duration":13.96},{"text":"This is a determination that must be made by this Court, exercising its independent judgment and review.","start":473.196,"stop":484.505,"duration":11.31},{"text":"Secondly, even if the perceive a basis test is applicable, there is no ground in this case for perceiving a basis that Title III is aimed at a Fourteenth Amendment objective.","start":484.505,"stop":500.598,"duration":16.09},{"text":"Now, the defendant relies on a single case, Katzenbach versus Morgan.","start":500.598,"stop":507.059,"duration":6.46},{"text":"I am sure the Court is familiar with the case, but to briefly reiterate the facts, there Congress enactment had prohibited the states from denying the vote on account of illiteracy to any person of Puerto Rican ancestry who had attended six years in an American school.","start":507.059,"stop":526.093,"duration":19.03},{"text":"The difficult problem in the case was the literacy tests on their face, certainly are not invidious or irrational.","start":526.093,"stop":536.428,"duration":10.34},{"text":"Nevertheless, the Court and we believe correctly upheld the Act, because it and I quote, “Maybe readily seen as plainly adapted to further the aims of Equal Protection.”","start":536.428,"stop":551.141,"duration":14.71},{"text":"The Court in its majority opinion followed two rationales in reaching this conclusion.","start":551.141,"stop":557.697,"duration":6.56},{"text":"First, that the enhanced political power would or maybe helpful in gaining non-discriminatory governmental services for Puerto Ricans, and for that reason the Court could perceive a basis that the legislation was necessary and proper to ensure Equal Protection of the laws for this particular ethnic minority group.","start":557.697,"stop":581.425,"duration":23.73},{"text":"Secondly, the Court could perceive a basis for Congress ascertaining that the New York Literacy test was being used as a direct device to deny the Franchise to Puerto Ricans, solely because of their national origin.","start":581.425,"stop":599.67,"duration":18.25},{"text":"Under both rationales, the Court, and again we believe rightly, defined Congress' powers to determine what is necessary and proper in the broadest terms and confined its review to whether it could perceive a basis for the congressional determination.","start":599.67,"stop":620.962,"duration":21.29},{"text":"But contrary to the defendant's argument, the Court merely confirmed what was obvious in that case, that the object of the legislation was plainly adopted to furthering the aims of the Fourteenth Amendment.","start":620.962,"stop":636.178,"duration":15.22},{"text":"As the Court itself said or recognized the practical, the sole practical effect of that Act in Katzenbach versus Morgan was to extend the franchise to large segments of the minority group which had heretofore been denied the right largely as a result of their national origin.","start":636.178,"stop":658.931,"duration":22.75},{"text":"And of course State action denying rights to the minorities because of their race, color, national origin are classic Fourteenth Amendment objectives.","start":658.931,"stop":671.815,"duration":12.88},{"text":"But contrary to defendant's argument, there is no suggestion in Katzenbach versus Morgan that the Court was saying that Congress had not only brought powers to fashion remedies, but that Congress could indeed determine what is prohibited by Sections 1, in other words, what is prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause and that that determination by Congress would be binding upon this Court.","start":671.815,"stop":700.905,"duration":29.09},{"text":"Defendant's interpretation can only be supported by taking isolated sentences from the opinion and reading those sentences totally out of context.","start":700.905,"stop":712.212,"duration":11.31},{"text":"Furthermore, there is no support in the precedence for defendant's interpretation.","start":712.212,"stop":717.62,"duration":5.41},{"text":"Defendant cites two cases involving interstate commerce, but those cases, the issue in those issues was not what is interstate commerce, but rather what is Congress' powers under the necessary and proper clause.","start":717.62,"stop":734.497,"duration":16.88},{"text":"In all of those cases the Court still reserved to itself the ultimate determination of the issue of what is Interstate Commerce.","start":734.497,"stop":746.061,"duration":11.56},{"text":"I'd like to suggest that if we follow defendant's rationale, it would mean that there will be hardly an area of State Legislation or State Law which Congress could not preempt.","start":746.061,"stop":759.707,"duration":13.65},{"text":"Because as this Court has many times recognized, legislatures must make choices and necessarily must make classifications or if you like, we can call them discriminations, but these classifications are inherent in the legislative process.","start":759.707,"stop":779.545,"duration":19.84},{"text":"Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit all classifications and never has, but only those which are irrelevant, invidious, or irrational.","start":779.545,"stop":792.263,"duration":12.72},{"text":"But if we are going to leave to Congress the prerogative to determine which classifications come within the equal protection, then Congress could declare almost all State legislation, declare the classifications therein as a violation of Equal Protection and thus be within their scope, so that they can preempt the states and render your state legislatures virtually unnecessary.","start":792.263,"stop":822.186,"duration":29.92},{"text":"But as a practical matter, the contraction of state power or state jurisdiction under defendant's rationale may not be as significant as the effect of that rationale would have upon the jurisdiction of this Court.","start":822.186,"stop":842.661,"duration":20.47},{"text":"In the first place, if we follow defendant's rationale and if Congress can determine what is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, then by equal logic, Congress should be able to determine what is not violating of the amendment.","start":842.661,"stop":863.257,"duration":20.6},{"text":"I think the Court in its opinion, in Katzenbach versus Morgan clearly indicates that it was not buying the defendant's argument, because in Footnote 10, the Court indicates that, no, it is reserving to itself, to its independent judgment what is violative and what is not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.","start":863.257,"stop":886.611,"duration":23.35}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, we reserved it only one way, in one direction?","start":886.611,"stop":892.361,"duration":5.75}]},{"speakerName":"Lee Johnson","textObjs":[{"text":"My only response to that Mr. Justice would be that I can't see how you can reserve it one way and I go both ways and I think that the fact that footnote is there --","start":892.361,"stop":904.621,"duration":12.26}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"That's what the footnote says --","start":904.621,"stop":911.091,"duration":6.47}]},{"speakerName":"Lee Johnson","textObjs":[{"text":"The question is whether -- I think really the question is whether the majority opinion goes as far as the government says it does, and I think one of the indications that it does not is that footnote.","start":911.091,"stop":924.982,"duration":13.89}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I am not depending on the footnote because I was on the other side of it (Inaudible)","start":924.982,"stop":931.586,"duration":6.6}]},{"speakerName":"Hugo L. Black","textObjs":[{"text":"May I ask you one question?","start":931.586,"stop":933.183,"duration":1.6}]},{"speakerName":"Lee Johnson","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, sir.","start":933.183,"stop":934.226,"duration":1.04}]},{"speakerName":"Hugo L. Black","textObjs":[{"text":"Would your position be different, if rule of Federal Act provided was that voters voting for State Officers like Governor and so forth, or that if it provided, it affected only voters voting for President or members of Congress?","start":934.226,"stop":955.618,"duration":21.39}]},{"speakerName":"Lee Johnson","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that the legislation would be on a stronger basis, if it was limited to only Federal officers because then possibly the government could rely on its general preservation of the federal election process as it grounds in not the Fourteenth Amendment to uphold the statute.","start":955.618,"stop":976.978,"duration":21.36},{"text":"So for that reason I would say that it would be a different.","start":976.978,"stop":980.948,"duration":3.97},{"text":"It would certainly be a different ballgame, but in this case, they have rested it solely upon the Fourteenth Amendment.","start":980.948,"stop":989.425,"duration":8.48}]},{"speakerName":"Hugo L. Black","textObjs":[{"text":"You mean it applies to all voters, for State and Federal officers?","start":989.425,"stop":992.699,"duration":3.27}]},{"speakerName":"Lee Johnson","textObjs":[{"text":"Right.","start":992.699,"stop":995.927,"duration":3.23}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E. Burger","textObjs":[{"text":"Are the provisions severable or --","start":995.927,"stop":1001.188,"duration":5.26}]},{"speakerName":"Lee Johnson","textObjs":[{"text":"I think it is possible to make them severable, although the Act is not contained in severability clause, and I think if we do make them severable, the Court should maybe consider the very definite administrative difficulty that this would probably create, and maybe it would be better to refer it back to Congress because if the states are put in a position, they have to grant this Franchise to eighteen-year-olds in Federal elections, but not in State elections, this creates a tremendous administrative burden.","start":1001.188,"stop":1033.999,"duration":32.81},{"text":"So it seems to me there would be a real question of whether Congress actually intended that the statute to be severable.","start":1033.999,"stop":1043.987,"duration":9.99},{"text":"The second point I would like to make is that if Congress is to be the interpretor of the Fourteenth Amendment, then it likewise would have to be the interpretor of other sections of the Constitution.","start":1043.987,"stop":1058.977,"duration":14.99},{"text":"For example, Congress could not only determine what was necessary and proper, but could determine what in fact is Interstate Commerce.","start":1058.977,"stop":1068.4,"duration":9.42},{"text":"Congress could reserve for itself to determine what is in fact a constitutional tax.","start":1068.4,"stop":1074.622,"duration":6.22},{"text":"I point you to Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution which says that “Congress shall have the power to make all the laws which will be necessary and proper and all other powers vested by this Constitution and the Government of the United States or any department or officer thereof.”","start":1074.622,"stop":1096.167,"duration":21.54},{"text":"Under defendant's rationale, Congress could determine itself the limits of the power conferred upon itself, the limits of the power conferred upon the President, the limits of the power conferred upon this Court, and the limits of the powers of the Federal Government as against the State subject only to the test of whether this Court could perceive a basis.","start":1096.167,"stop":1119.665,"duration":23.5},{"text":"It seems to me that if we follow defendant's rationale, we're doing nothing less than repudiating the doctrine of judicial review.","start":1119.665,"stop":1128.721,"duration":9.06},{"text":"We submit that Katzenbach versus Morgan does not go that far, but merely holds that Congress has broad powers to fashion remedies to enforce the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment.","start":1128.721,"stop":1143.998,"duration":15.28},{"text":"In the instant case, there is no equal protection objective that can be identified, unlike Katzenbach versus Morgan which enfranchised a minority ethnic group.","start":1143.998,"stop":1159.778,"duration":15.78},{"text":"The sole effect, the sole practical effect of Title III will be to enfranchise any person who is between the age of 18 and 21.","start":1159.778,"stop":1169.712,"duration":9.93},{"text":"There is no suggestion on the congressional debate and indeed there could be none that this will enfranchise a group which had heretofore been discriminated against because of their race, their color, their national origin or economic status or on any other basis that could be classified as invidious, irrelevant, or irrational.","start":1169.712,"stop":1196.236,"duration":26.52},{"text":"Now to some, including myself personally, it would be desirable to extend the franchise, but legislative desirability is not the test.","start":1196.236,"stop":1208.798,"duration":12.56},{"text":"The issue which this Court must decide and cannot cede to Congress to decide, is whether restricting the franchise to those who are 21 is so inherently unreasonable to be irrational or irrelevant.","start":1208.798,"stop":1227.427,"duration":18.63},{"text":"We submit that 21 years of age, the 21 years of age standard employed by Oregon, 46 other states, indeed which is infirmed in

mentioned.","start":1227.427,"stop":1248.17,"duration":20.74},{"text":"But this is certainly an affirmance of what has gone for many years, that the 21-year age standard is a reasonable classification even if it might not be a desirable classification, it is a reasonable classification, the ball is far short of the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment.","start":1248.17,"stop":1269.324,"duration":21.15},{"text":"We feel that the government advances the argument that there must be a compelling state interest and advances many arguments which are legislative reasons, not constitutional reasons, but legislative reasons for extending the franchise to 18-year olds.","start":1269.324,"stop":1294.119,"duration":24.79},{"text":"And the

gives.","start":1294.119,"stop":1303.316,"duration":9.2},{"text":"We suggest, once you accept the proposition that a line has been drawn, there is an area in here to which reasonable men differ as to
