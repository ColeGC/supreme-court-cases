Union, but the reason for that is solely because of the Trainmen has been merged into that successor union.","start":20.656,"stop":34.174,"duration":13.52},{"text":"At all times that the injunctions were issued in this case, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen was the defendant on the appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, the merger into the surviving union were quashed.","start":34.174,"stop":48.951,"duration":14.78},{"text":"The questions presented in this case are whether the injunction issued deprives the union members of rights arguably guaranteed by this Court in Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, or whether those injunctive probations are contrary to the this Court’s subsequent opinion in Mine Workers versus Illinois State Bar Association.","start":48.951,"stop":75.846,"duration":26.9},{"text":"Alternatively, the petitioner contends that the proceedings after remand on the first appeal by Michigan Supreme Court were such as to deprive the union of its constitutional right the procedure of due process.","start":75.846,"stop":93.373,"duration":17.53},{"text":"This case begun with the filing of a complaint in 1959, and basically that complaint paraphrases some of the language and the holdings of the Illinois Supreme Court in the opinion of Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.","start":93.373,"stop":110.874,"duration":17.5},{"text":"In fact, one of the defenses of the Brotherhood to the complaint was at the case was moot because of the fact that it had complied with the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court.","start":110.874,"stop":126.776,"duration":15.9},{"text":"In that defense, the Brotherhood alleged that the State Bar of Michigan had presented evidence before the Illinois Supreme Court.","start":126.776,"stop":136.865,"duration":10.09},{"text":"That allegation was not denied in the reply and indeed during the trial in 1961, the counsel for the State Bar at appendix 39 and 40 stated that its evidence and its charges were presented to the Illinois Supreme Court, and that the Illinois Supreme Court held that there should be no further proceeding on those charges.","start":136.865,"stop":160.847,"duration":23.98},{"text":"Nevertheless, before the Illinois Supreme Court opinion by its terms became effective, which was to be on July 1, 1959, the State Bar filed this complaint.","start":160.847,"stop":174.185,"duration":13.34},{"text":"Basically, the State Bar claimed that the Brotherhood had a plan of recommending and urging that its members seek legal advice, and not only seek legal advice but retraining of the union counsel.","start":174.185,"stop":187.098,"duration":12.91},{"text":"The union admitted such in its answer.","start":187.098,"stop":190.861,"duration":3.76},{"text":"The State Bar alleged that a majority of such Federal Employers’ Liability Act cases went to the union counsel.","start":190.861,"stop":199.554,"duration":8.69},{"text":"The union denied that allegation, but did admit that in some cases but not in all and they went to such counsel.","start":199.554,"stop":207.734,"duration":8.18},{"text":"The possibility of a consent decree proving fruitless, the case went to trial.","start":207.734,"stop":215.849,"duration":8.11},{"text":"And at trial, the counsel for the State Bars said the only issue in the case was whether or not large numbers of cases went to the legal counsel of the union.","start":215.849,"stop":228.126,"duration":12.28},{"text":"So, he proceeded to prove through only one witness, a man by the name of Walsh who was employed by the Association of American Railroads Claims Research Bureau, and who in such employment received reports from other railroads as to how many cases, the appellee cases, were handled by various attorneys where the residents were Michigan residents.","start":228.126,"stop":253.071,"duration":24.94},{"text":"The witness also testified in appendix 102 that since 1953, the Association of American Railroads had been the chief investigating agency for the State Bar and had been in the Michigan state seeking evidence.","start":253.071,"stop":274.542,"duration":21.47},{"text":"After the hearing,

Richmond.","start":274.542,"stop":289.775,"duration":15.23},{"text":"After the briefs, there was a 1962 injunction decree issued in this case.","start":289.775,"stop":296.891,"duration":7.12},{"text":"An appeal was taken by the Brotherhood to the Michigan Supreme Court.","start":296.891,"stop":302.02,"duration":5.13},{"text":"While the appeal was pending, this Court handed down its opinion in 1964 Brotherhood.","start":302.02,"stop":309.312,"duration":7.29},{"text":"The Michigan Supreme Court after being informed of the opinion of this Court, reversed and remanded, and specifically stated that permission for the amendment of the plaintiff’s bill to seek, if it be so advised, relief not inconsistent with this Court’s opinion in 1964 Brotherhood.","start":309.312,"stop":332.58,"duration":23.27},{"text":"The next action of the trial court was a motion for a judgment in accordance with a 1965 injunction decree of the city court of Richmond and that motion was not acted upon.","start":332.58,"stop":345.579,"duration":13},{"text":"In 1966, the Virginia Supreme Court entered its opinion on the appeal from the 1965 decree and reversed the part of that opinion which attempted to draw a line between solicitation, and between recommendation and urging.","start":345.579,"stop":367.817,"duration":22.24},{"text":"The State Bar of Virginia, petition for a certiorari to this Court and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen opposed the petition.","start":367.817,"stop":373.258,"duration":5.44},{"text":"The petition was denied.","start":373.258,"stop":375.884,"duration":2.63},{"text":"In 1967, this Court handed down it mine worker’s decision.","start":375.884,"stop":380.541,"duration":4.66},{"text":"And following that decision, the trial court in this case handed down the 1968 decree which is now before this Court.","start":380.541,"stop":390.583,"duration":10.04},{"text":"In handing down that decree, the trial judge in this case stated that the Virginia Supreme Court’s reading of this Court’s opinion in Brotherhood was sufficient to warrant the promulgating of the decree in this case.","start":390.583,"stop":411.768,"duration":21.18},{"text":"As to the Mine Worker’s decision which was brought to its attention, it said that it’s irrelevant that the Mine Worker’s decision dealt only with the financial connection.","start":411.768,"stop":421.24,"duration":9.47},{"text":"There was then a appeal to the Supreme Court of Michigan, and that is that judgment immediately below.","start":421.24,"stop":428.528,"duration":7.29},{"text":"By 4 to 3 decision, the Michigan Supreme Court affirmed the judgment.","start":428.528,"stop":435.232,"duration":6.7},{"text":"It did not look at the injunctive provisions.","start":435.232,"stop":437.776,"duration":2.54},{"text":"Instead, it proceeded upon a analysis of this Court’s 1964 Brotherhood opinion as it was stated by the Virginia Supreme Court.","start":437.776,"stop":450.308,"duration":12.53},{"text":"Accepting that analysis, it stated that it would defend its understanding of the tenants of equal justice under law if the Brotherhood were to receive more relief in Michigan then it had already obtained in Virginia.","start":450.308,"stop":465.29,"duration":14.98},{"text":"Indeed, it said that absence a specific order from Washington it would not enter such an order or a judgment.","start":465.29,"stop":474.293,"duration":9},{"text":"The dissent agreed with the contention of petitioner here.","start":474.293,"stop":478.932,"duration":4.64},{"text":"It stated that the decree could not be entered because of this Court’s decision in 1964 Brotherhood, and said even if that were not so, it would say that the Mine Workers’ case was sufficient to bar the entry of the decree.","start":478.932,"stop":492.751,"duration":13.82},{"text":"And finally under Michigan law, it stated that the proofs was stale, the pleadings was stale and that there was no clear and convincing proof of any violations, and therefore under Michigan law, it should not have entered.","start":492.751,"stop":508.527,"duration":15.78},{"text":"We then turn to the first question of this case, whether or not that this decree is contrary to this Court’s opinion in 1964 Brotherhood.","start":508.527,"stop":522.769,"duration":14.24},{"text":"In that opinion as in many other opinions dealing with free speech, this Court has consistently stated a rule of law which was ignored in this case.","start":522.769,"stop":535.119,"duration":12.35},{"text":"The burden this Court has stated and very clearly and very directly so far as I’m concern is upon the State Bar to prove substantive evils.","start":535.119,"stop":543.041,"duration":7.92},{"text":"In this case, there was no proof of any substantive evil, indeed, there was no updating of the complaint or any other updating of the proof.","start":543.041,"stop":550.601,"duration":7.56},{"text":"The proof in this case relates at the very latest to the year of 1960.","start":550.601,"stop":557.071,"duration":6.47},{"text":"When the petitioner here requested that there be an amending of the complaint, so that there could be a sharpening of the issues, that request was ignored despite the language in the first Michigan Supreme Court opinion which stated that permission was granted for leave to amend.","start":557.071,"stop":577.945,"duration":20.87},{"text":"In the second Supreme Court opinion where the -- that court stated in the majority opinion that the right to amend was an alternative and that the State Bar did not have to avail itself of the accorded right to amend, indeed, it didn’t avail itself of the accorded right to amend.","start":577.945,"stop":596.721,"duration":18.78},{"text":"It’s the counsel at one point stated that he did not choose to amend.","start":596.721,"stop":602.365,"duration":5.64},{"text":"Until the Michigan Supreme Court was at spoke, it was unknown to this petitioner that there was any alternative whatsoever.","start":602.365,"stop":609.087,"duration":6.72},{"text":"Assuming that there was such an alternative, it would seem that this would be a denial of due process.","start":609.087,"stop":615.626,"duration":6.54},{"text":"Turning again to the Brotherhood case, that case held at pages 6 and 7 of the United States report that this case did not involve ambulance chasing, it did not involve unauthorized practice, it did not involve the commercialization of the legal profession.","start":615.626,"stop":635.937,"duration":20.31},{"text":"The contention of the respondent and of the court below seems to be directly contradictory to that language of this

Virginia case in one of its findings held that all of the cases or substantially all of them were channeled through legal counsel.","start":653.54,"stop":670.938,"duration":17.4},{"text":"In this case, the allegation was the majority, but the proof failed to prove any majority and the finding was that a large number.","start":670.938,"stop":677.356,"duration":6.42},{"text":"And in fact, the finding does not really show a large number.","start":677.356,"stop":681.337,"duration":3.98},{"text":"At page 168 of the appendix, there is a summary sheet which is plaintiff's exhibit 17 which shows a summary of the evidence presented through the Association of American Railroads.","start":681.337,"stop":697.838,"duration":16.5},{"text":"And as Your Honor will note the bottom line deals with the year 1960, the latest year and shows a total number of FELA cases.","start":697.838,"stop":709.335,"duration":11.5},{"text":"34 of those, in the second column, only 6 were handled by the legal counsel, 20 by Michigan attorneys and 8 by other attorneys.","start":709.335,"stop":722.088,"duration":12.75},{"text":"The only substantial amount of cases shown is in the first line which is July 1, 1953 to March 31, 1955.","start":722.088,"stop":733.6,"duration":11.51},{"text":"There, is a 197 cases of which a 126 supposedly went to the firm, to the legal counsel firm, but when the data on which that summary is based is examined, it's seen that this numbers of cases does not deal with 53, but instead deals with the great number of years.","start":733.6,"stop":758.548,"duration":24.95},{"text":"As a matter of fact, the plaintiff’s exhibit 4 I believe it is; plaintiffs’ exhibit 3 shows great numbers of cases which were undated.","start":758.548,"stop":773.302,"duration":14.75},{"text":"And then, shows for the legal counsel 45 settlements, 46 settlements, 47 settlements, and 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, and then goes into the 53 settlements.","start":773.302,"stop":787.325,"duration":14.02},{"text":"Now reason for that was that in 1953, the Association of American Railroads formed this claims research bureau which went out to obtain evidence against various counsel.","start":787.325,"stop":800.165,"duration":12.84},{"text":"And as a starter, they had these cards signed in from the various railroads so the first cards that came in dealt with many another years outside of the years within the exhibit of 53 through 55.","start":800.165,"stop":818.036,"duration":17.87},{"text":"It’s also I believe note worthy that primarily those earlier years are shown are the legal counsel cases.","start":818.036,"stop":824.538,"duration":6.5},{"text":"Any cases by other counsel are not shown by year.","start":824.538,"stop":827.72,"duration":3.18},{"text":"And so, it creates a problem is to whether this is selected evidence or not, but be that as it may and we always have had in this Virginia case and in the Michigan case, questions as to the substantial evidence backing any of the injunctive provisions.","start":827.72,"stop":843.407,"duration":15.69},{"text":"The fact remains that the State Bar's own exhibits show immediately preceding the issuance of the first injunction, a very minor number of cases handled by the legal counsel’s firm.","start":843.407,"stop":860.971,"duration":17.56},{"text":"I don’t’ think that I need to belabor the proposition that there has been shifting of the burden here by the Michigan Supreme Court and by the court below.","start":860.971,"stop":871.76,"duration":10.79},{"text":"If I have not adequately set it out in my brief, I am quite sure that the brief for the amicus, the FLCIO clearly and succinctly shows what is required here.","start":871.76,"stop":883.194,"duration":11.43},{"text":"I think that I would like to particularly note page 7 of the that brief where the amicus states that the restrictions on group legal practice plans must be justified by proof, tending to show that the practice which is enjoined is quote “an oppressive, malicious or aberratious use of the legal process for purely private gain,” quoting this Court’s opinion in NAACP versus Button, and then the commercialization language from the Trainmen opinion.","start":883.194,"stop":911.07,"duration":27.88},{"text":"I think that being the standard that there is a complete failure of proof in this case whether it’s judged as of 1960, or as of 1968 when this injunction was issued.","start":911.07,"stop":923.068,"duration":12},{"text":"That seems also to me that the Mine Workers decision adds a further reason why this case should be reversed.","start":923.068,"stop":933.362,"duration":10.29},{"text":"In Mine Workers as this Court were recall the union counsel was on a salary and all of the cases went to him without any further compensation.","start":933.362,"stop":943.338,"duration":9.98},{"text":"Indeed, the evidence showed that the fact that he filled out an injury form was sufficient to cause the legal counsel to begin processing the workmen’s compensation claim in that case.","start":943.338,"stop":953.098,"duration":9.76},{"text":"That case also was completely an unauthorized practice of law case, and that seems to be the principle defense of the State Bar as to the injunction here is that we are engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, although, there was no such allegation in the only complaint file below.","start":953.098,"stop":970.91,"duration":17.81},{"text":"That Mine Workers case, I think is also particularly relevant on the first injunctive provision about which we complaint.","start":970.91,"stop":977.651,"duration":6.74},{"text":"The injunctive provisions are set out at appendix 176 and 177, also set out various points in the brief.","start":977.651,"stop":985.934,"duration":8.28},{"text":"The first provision enjoined the union from giving or furnishing legal advice.","start":985.934,"stop":991.591,"duration":5.66},{"text":"Now, it just seems to me that for reason which we state in our brief at pages 23 and thereafter that this is not part of the Brotherhood’s plan.","start":991.591,"stop":1001.077,"duration":9.49},{"text":"The Brotherhood’s plan is exactly opposite.","start":1001.077,"stop":1003.132,"duration":2.05},{"text":"It’s not the unauthorized practice of law.","start":1003.132,"stop":1005.852,"duration":2.72},{"text":"The union is not practicing law.","start":1005.852,"stop":1007.35,"duration":1.5},{"text":"The union is sending the cases to the union lawyer and saying that the lawyer practices law.","start":1007.35,"stop":1013.399,"duration":6.05},{"text":"This is the practice of law.","start":1013.399,"stop":1015.222,"duration":1.82},{"text":"It’s a new definition of the unauthorized practice of law.","start":1015.222,"stop":1017.923,"duration":2.7},{"text":"Typically, that arises when the corporation itself acts through lawyers and the lawyers are merely agents.","start":1017.923,"stop":1024.396,"duration":6.47},{"text":"In this case, there is no doubt that a retainer contract is entered the too between the injured employee and the lawyer, and then that, that becomes a simple handling of a case by a lawyer-client relationship.","start":1024.396,"stop":1039.474,"duration":15.08},{"text":"There’s been no proof either in Virginia or here that anything else occurs.","start":1039.474,"stop":1044.594,"duration":5.12},{"text":"The second provision it seems to me also is such that it would strike as it could be interpreted, and that’s an ambiguous Section against the operation of this plan.","start":1044.594,"stop":1055.899,"duration":11.3},{"text":"That prohibits informing any lawyer or lawyers that an accident has been suffered by a member in furnishing the name and address for the purpose of obtaining legal employment for any lawyer.","start":1055.899,"stop":1066.753,"duration":10.85},{"text":"And this I think, is part and parcel of the Brotherhood’s plan at it reads.","start":1066.753,"stop":1071.64,"duration":4.89},{"text":"As Virginia interpreted, it seems to be a method of subverting this Court’s language in Trainmen.","start":1071.64,"stop":1079.428,"duration":7.79},{"text":"In Trainmen, this Court's stated that of course, counsel had the same right to accept the cases that the union had in channeling the cases.","start":1079.428,"stop":1089.502,"duration":10.07},{"text":"Virginia recognized that language, but stated that it did not interpreted as such that would permit the lawyer to do more than accept and rather intend it to bring injunction actions or disbarment action against any lawyer who did anymore than accept, again, it seems to me that it should be stricken down.","start":1089.502,"stop":1108.778,"duration":19.28},{"text":"The third provision deals with the defraying of expenses; that is from stating that they will suggest or

obtained.","start":1119.086,"stop":1131.539,"duration":12.45},{"text":"The fourth provision from controlling directly or indirectly to fees charged, it seems to me they have stricken down by the Mine Workers case because you can place a lawyer on a salary and not be guilty of any violations.","start":1131.539,"stop":1143.469,"duration":11.93},{"text":"Constitutionally, it would seem to me that you have the right to do less than that, and that is to do what the union used to do in this case to limit the counsel’s fee to 25%.","start":1143.469,"stop":1159.116,"duration":15.65},{"text":"The fifth injunctive provision is a rather peculiar one.","start":1159.116,"stop":1163.918,"duration":4.8},{"text":"It prohibits accepting or receiving compensation of any kind directly or indirectly for the solicitation of legal employment for any lawyer.","start":1163.918,"stop":1172.494,"duration":8.58},{"text":"Now, the Virginia Supreme Court said that there could be no decree which prohibit solicitation.","start":1172.494,"stop":1178.176,"duration":5.68},{"text":"But yet, it let this provision stand which does not prohibits solicitation, but prohibits solicitation plus the receiving of compensation as I read it, it would seem to me that there is no evidence in the record as to this and it would seemed to me to be a most peculiar ambiguous Section that should be stricken down.","start":1178.176,"stop":1201.031,"duration":22.86},{"text":"The remainders of these provisions are such that they deal with financial connections of the some sort.","start":1201.031,"stop":1209.464,"duration":8.43},{"text":"I would like to particularly note that the last one from sharing in any recovery for personal injury or death by gift assignment or

of the evidence in this case, we have to generally deal with the Michigan statute which I suppose is that basis on which this injunction is issued.","start":1229.144,"stop":1246.817,"duration":17.67},{"text":"It’s the -- the only thing in the complaint under which they justify the issuance of the 1961 injunction, on page 32, we set out

known as ambulance chasing.","start":1246.817,"stop":1276.329,"duration":29.51},{"text":"And then stated that there were four separate indications of it, full meaning litigation, subornation of
