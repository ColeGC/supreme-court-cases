Dienelt","textObjs":[{"text":"I gather it was, I didn’t know.","start":259.007,"stop":262.735,"duration":3.73},{"text":"The question in the case then is the simple one and it’s whether a defendant can be convicted under this statute for intentionally engaging in conduct that is prohibited even though he doesn’t know that the law prohibits it.","start":262.735,"stop":277.4,"duration":14.66},{"text":"We believe that a shipper or carrier can be convicted under these circumstances.","start":277.4,"stop":283.07,"duration":5.67},{"text":"Our position is simply that proof of knowledge of pertinent the facts is what is essential and proof of knowledge of law is not that the defendant is presumed to know the regulations governing transportation of dangerous articles.","start":283.07,"stop":298.73,"duration":15.66},{"text":"Now, he's charge with that knowledge under the fundamental principle that ignorance of the law does not excuse its violations by one who intentionally engages in conduct which the law forbids.","start":298.73,"stop":313.393,"duration":14.66},{"text":"Charging shippers and carriers of dangerous substances with knowledge of regulations regarding their transport seems to be a perfectly reasonable thing to do.","start":313.393,"stop":326.117,"duration":12.72},{"text":"In the first place, the substances are dangerous and that alone ought to signal, the possibility of existence of a regulatory scheme regarding the transportation.","start":326.117,"stop":336.746,"duration":10.63},{"text":"So this case in that sense is similar to United States against Freed which this Court decided this month.","start":336.746,"stop":343.667,"duration":6.92},{"text":"And in that case, the Court ruled that specific intent for knowledge that gun were unregistered was an essential element of the crime of possession of an unregistered firearm.","start":343.667,"stop":354.76,"duration":11.09},{"text":"In effect, that the rule that the individual could be presumed to know or charged with knowledge of the registration requirement.","start":354.76,"stop":364.636,"duration":9.88},{"text":"In this case and in numerous regulatory areas, there's another factor which makes it particularly appropriate to charge the people engaged in forbidden conduct with knowledge of the regulations and that is that this appellee and most of the people who are brought under a prosecution under this statute are in the business of shipping dangerous substances.","start":364.636,"stop":390.775,"duration":26.14},{"text":"So, our fundamental position is that there is no basis in this case for making an exception to the principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse.","start":390.775,"stop":403.097,"duration":12.32},{"text":"We’d like to emphasize three points in that connection.","start":403.097,"stop":407.746,"duration":4.65},{"text":"I would like to discuss the language of the statute, the effect of this Court’s decision in Boyce Motor Lines against the United States, some 20 years ago in 342 U.S., and the history of the statute.","start":407.746,"stop":424.235,"duration":16.49},{"text":"The first point deals with the language, the statute says, “knowingly violates regulations.”","start":424.235,"stop":432.281,"duration":8.05},{"text":"This is a typical regulatory pattern in numerous areas where Congress simply can’t fill out the details of the statute.","start":432.281,"stop":441.74,"duration":9.46},{"text":"It sets forth the general prohibition and leaves to the administrative agency the responsibility for filling in the details and designating the specific conduct that’s forbidden.","start":441.74,"stop":453.972,"duration":12.23},{"text":"And this language “knowingly violates regulations” is standard terminology.","start":453.972,"stop":460.361,"duration":6.39},{"text":"It’s used in numerous statutes we've cited, some of them in Footnote 7 of our brief at page 13.","start":460.361,"stop":470.751,"duration":10.39},{"text":"We submit that if Congress in these various regulatory areas had set forth the prohibited conduct in the statute itself, there wouldn’t be any question but that the Government’s only obligation would be to prove knowledge of the facts and not knowledge of the law.","start":470.751,"stop":488.331,"duration":17.58},{"text":"For example, in this case, the Congress had written a statute that says, “Whoever knowingly ships sulfuric acid without stating on the shipping papers that it is sulfuric acid and that it is a corrosive liquid shall be punished.”","start":488.331,"stop":506.106,"duration":17.77},{"text":"We submit in that situation there wouldn’t be any question that our burden of proof would be what we've alleged in the information here, knowing conduct.","start":506.106,"stop":516.063,"duration":9.96},{"text":"Similarly, if Congress had written as is it would have had to in a regulatory statute or as it likely would and as it has in cases where it has set forth conduct that is prohibited in the statute itself, set forth a number of different kinds of conduct and then had one provision that says, “whoever knowingly violates the statute or the statutory provisions shall be punished.”","start":516.063,"stop":542.363,"duration":26.3},{"text":"We submit the same result would obtain that we would have to prove knowledge of the facts and not knowledge of the law.","start":542.363,"stop":551.211,"duration":8.85},{"text":"We don’t think the results shall be any different because Congress has adopted a convenient shorthand in this case as a means of delegating responsibility to the administrative agency.","start":551.211,"stop":562.329,"duration":11.12},{"text":"In this case, the Department of Transportation and for incorporating all the various prohibitions that are involved.","start":562.329,"stop":570.845,"duration":8.52},{"text":"We realize it’s possible to read the language “knowingly violate regulations” to suggest that you have to know what the regulation is.","start":570.845,"stop":580.239,"duration":9.39},{"text":"But we think that the position which evidently is the appellee’s position and which was the position stated in a concurring opinion by Judge Magruder in the St. Johnsbury Trucking case which was a leading early Court of Appeals decision on this matter, that the use of that language justifies a distinction","start":580.239,"stop":599.405,"duration":19.17},{"text":".We don’t believe that that’s a proper reading.","start":599.405,"stop":604.18,"duration":4.77},{"text":"It places too much emphasis in the abstract or the semantics.","start":604.18,"stop":608.21,"duration":4.03},{"text":"It ignores the practical reality which we feel make it perfectly clear that the use of the phrase “knowingly violates regulations” in this case is simply a shorthand.","start":608.21,"stop":620.793,"duration":12.58},{"text":"In fact, there are some cases in which Congress has on a rare occasion indicated that an ignorance of a regulation or a lack of knowledge of a regulation will be an excuse.","start":620.793,"stop":632.792,"duration":12},{"text":"It will be an affirmative defense and it stated that quite plainly in the statute in language quite different from the language here which decided two similar cases in footnote 11 of our brief on page 16.","start":632.792,"stop":648.648,"duration":15.86},{"text":"Now, turning specifically to the judicial and legislative consideration of the statute, our second point is that this Court’s decision in the Boyce case should involve the same statute.","start":648.648,"stop":662.385,"duration":13.74},{"text":"It does not require the Government to prove knowledge of the regulations.","start":662.385,"stop":666.36,"duration":3.98},{"text":"The Boyce decision didn’t hold that, it really didn’t reach that issue.","start":666.36,"stop":669.963,"duration":3.6},{"text":"It didn’t specifically address itself to it.","start":669.963,"stop":673.021,"duration":3.06},{"text":"The Court there assumed as did the parties that the shipper, it was a carrier on that case, knew the regulations and proceeded to examine factual circumstances not the question of knowledge of the law.","start":673.021,"stop":690.77,"duration":17.75},{"text":"The issue in Boyce was whether a regulation was vague and the regulation involved dealt with the routing of trucks through congested areas and it required that the trucks be routed this so far as practicable, that was the key language in that case as far as the vagueness is concerned, as far as practicable to avoid congested areas such as towns and the defendant in that case had routed its trucks to the Holland Town in New York.","start":690.77,"stop":720.558,"duration":29.79},{"text":"The District Court dismissed the case with rather three counts of an indictment there, on ground that it was unconstitutionally vague.","start":720.558,"stop":728.315,"duration":7.76},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed and this Court affirmed.","start":728.315,"stop":731.176,"duration":2.86},{"text":"And in affirming the decision, this Court indicated that the fact that the defendant was required “knowingly” to violate the regulations was crucial and it stated what it meant by that requirement, in a passage that we’ve set forth on page 10 of our brief.","start":731.176,"stop":752.762,"duration":21.59},{"text":"It said the Government must prove not only that there was in fact a preferable route but also that the defendant knew of such route and nevertheless took a more dangerous one.","start":752.762,"stop":763.126,"duration":10.36},{"text":"Or alternatively that the defendant willfully neglected to inquire whether there was such a route.","start":763.126,"stop":770.025,"duration":6.9},{"text":"The comparable requirement to that proof in this case, we submit is that not only did the defendant shipped a dangerous commodity without stating its nature on the shipping papers but also that it knew what he was doing or alternatively that he willfully neglected to ascertain what the facts were.","start":770.025,"stop":792.743,"duration":22.72},{"text":"There was nothing in Boyce and we submit there's nothing here to suggest that knowledge of the law was also an element of the Government’s proof and regulation in Boyce was more complex.","start":792.743,"stop":805.063,"duration":12.32},{"text":"As a result of that, the defendant as the Court suggested in Boyce might very well, by showing a good faith compliance with the regulations, by showing that he chose a route and he tried to choose the safest route that that might provide a defense and that that the jury in that case might equip on such a basis. But still the point was that it was factual circumstances that the regulation made pertinent and not the knowledge of the regulation itself that was critical.","start":805.063,"stop":838.672,"duration":33.61},{"text":"And we don’t suggest here that a showing by the defendant at a trial that he didn’t know what he was shipping or that he made some other inadvertent conduct would not be a defense.","start":838.672,"stop":856.435,"duration":17.76},{"text":"This was dismissal of an information.","start":856.435,"stop":858.808,"duration":2.37},{"text":"We don’t have a record.","start":858.808,"stop":859.72,"duration":0.91},{"text":"We don’t know what the defense of the appellee would be.","start":859.72,"stop":863.15,"duration":3.43},{"text":"We submit that there are genuine issues which in some cases may arise and that those should properly be determined at a trial.","start":863.15,"stop":873.035,"duration":9.88},{"text":"Finally, we’d like briefly to turn to the legislative history of this section.","start":873.035,"stop":879.931,"duration":6.9}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.
