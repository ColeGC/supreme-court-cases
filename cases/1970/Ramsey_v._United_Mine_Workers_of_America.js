producer.","start":94.459,"stop":101.605,"duration":7.15},{"text":"The head of consolidation testified in this case with respect to his competitors that even though the competitor operated in poor mining conditions with the less productivity than consolidation did still you don’t want him to have a lower wage scale than you if you can avoid it.","start":101.605,"stop":124.41,"duration":22.8},{"text":"And after organized BCOA in 1950, BCOA proceeded to negotiate with UMW throughout the 1950’s and 1960’s amendments to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1950.","start":124.41,"stop":142.912,"duration":18.5},{"text":"These amendments consisted very largely of substantial flat across the board wage increases applicable to every job in the coal industry regardless of the productivity or the mechanization of the particular job.","start":142.912,"stop":160.328,"duration":17.42},{"text":"These amendments were taken to

necessity for any company to stay alive.","start":265.791,"stop":278.666,"duration":12.88},{"text":"And from the national viewpoint, from the findings of the trial court there occurred an industrial

rapidly regaining the dominant share of production that they held before World War II.","start":302.042,"stop":315.223,"duration":13.18},{"text":"The court also found that if you put the whole coal industry of the country together, taking out the two largest producers that whole industry by 1960 was losing operating losses of millions of dollars a year under the national contract, while the

reserves.","start":418.717,"stop":440.503,"duration":21.79},{"text":"Now, the trial court’s opinion shows that in the period of damage in this case, 1959 to 1964, major companies actually owned by UMW

and confusion and down with strikes because of the inability to comply with this national contract.","start":459.957,"stop":472.291,"duration":12.33},{"text":"After the cancellation of their contracts in 1962 by the Union with demands that they make guarantees of future performance, the southern Tennessee operators organized an association and attempted to bargain with UMW of varying set of wage scales based upon the degree of mechanization or the productivity of the various types of mines in Southern Tennessee.","start":472.291,"stop":499.545,"duration":27.25},{"text":"The UMW refused and demanded that the national contract be signed again, but this time with the guarantees of performance.","start":499.545,"stop":509.601,"duration":10.06},{"text":"And the trial court found that the strike which followed was because of the inability to negotiate a contract in the field and this strike was actually open warfare.","start":509.601,"stop":521.958,"duration":12.36},{"text":"It pervaded three counties.","start":521.958,"stop":523.928,"duration":1.97},{"text":"It went on for three years, before the trial it was still going on at the trial, this case.","start":523.928,"stop":530.098,"duration":6.17},{"text":"And the trial court found that several men were killed, a great deal of violence, bloodshed and destruction of property have accompanied the strike much suffering deprivation and won’t have occurred, the Southern Tennessee coal field remains “ablated area.”","start":530.098,"stop":550.074,"duration":19.98},{"text":"Now, although the court found these facts both on the national level and on the local level, the court held the proof was insufficient to show that the course of conduct of UMW was because of conspiracy or agreement with major coal companies and their associations.","start":550.074,"stop":570.209,"duration":20.13},{"text":"The trial court held that this paragraph “A” of the Protective Wage Clause could be construed as UMW contended that it put a straightjacket or restraint on UMW’s bargaining freedom only with respect to those companies that had gotten organized or signed up under the national contract.","start":570.209,"stop":594.579,"duration":24.37},{"text":"It held that, thus that it applied to the 82% return of the industry that was under the national contract, but not applicable to the 18% that had not been organized under the contract -- not under UMW’s contracts at that time.","start":594.579,"stop":614.064,"duration":19.49},{"text":"Now, the court held that this difference made the restraint valid under antitrust law.","start":614.064,"stop":622.715,"duration":8.65},{"text":"Now, beyond the express language of the contract and the Protective Wage Clause, the court went on to hold that the course of conduct of the international union and the international officers in dealing with the industry over this period of 14 or 15 years was such as to show by a preponderance of evidence that there was an implied agreement with BCOA that UMW would negotiate only on national contract terms with all units of the industry, not just to the 82% but to the 100%.","start":622.715,"stop":661.766,"duration":39.05},{"text":"But the court held that the plaintiffs have the burden of proving this implied agreement not just by preponderance of evidence from the union’s course of conduct, but they have the duty to approve it by the clear proof rule of Norris-LaGuardia Section 6 and there was an absence of such clear proof.","start":661.766,"stop":684.268,"duration":22.5},{"text":"The court went on to hold that the evidence was insufficient to prove a pressure rate conspiracy to drive small coal companies out of the industry.","start":684.268,"stop":696.818,"duration":12.55},{"text":"But the court added at the end of this conclusion that were it not for the clear proof rule, the court might have reached different conclusions.","start":696.818,"stop":708.351,"duration":11.53},{"text":"Now, it is obvious from the trial court’s opinion throughout that it was applying this clear proof rule all the way to the point of reaching final conclusions as to antitrust violation regardless of the clarity of proof of authorization of the course of conduct of the international union and its officers over this period of 14 years.","start":708.351,"stop":735.376,"duration":27.02},{"text":"Regardless of that authorization -- obvious authorization, the clear proof rule was applied to that course of conduct to reach a conclusion as to whether that was a violation of law and the trial court rejected the majority and concurring opinions of this Court in the Pennington decision of 1965 saying that neither opinion expressed through majority rule of this Court and it added that the problem suppose to the small and medium size enterprises by the practice of National Collective Bargaining would appear real and substantial.","start":735.376,"stop":774.545,"duration":39.17},{"text":"However, that their solution lies in the federal antitrust laws as now enacted by Congress is doubtful.","start":774.545,"stop":782.436,"duration":7.89},{"text":"This was a decision just a few months after the decision of this Court remanding Pennington for trial under the antitrust laws on its similar issues.","start":782.436,"stop":796.27,"duration":13.83},{"text":"The one point from this Court’s opinions in Pennington which most impressed the trial court was derived from the second footnote of the majority opinion of Mr. Justice White.","start":796.27,"stop":808.942,"duration":12.67},{"text":"We think the Court misconstrued this footnote.","start":808.942,"stop":812.354,"duration":3.41},{"text":"Obviously, the Court construed this footnote to me that the union needs to deal in good faith bargaining only with the dominant unit of the industry and over a period of 15 years can take the resulting contracts and cram them down the throats of hundreds of other units and all sorts of varying circumstances without changing a single comma in a single contract over that whole period.","start":812.354,"stop":841.408,"duration":29.05},{"text":"Even though, it means obvious repression of competition and even though it means tragic effects on three-fourths of the union’s membership, while the favored companies grow and prosper and take over the industry.","start":841.408,"stop":858.215,"duration":16.81},{"text":"Now, three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals therefore with these views of the law applicable to these circumstances and they reverse the judgments in favor of UMW.","start":858.215,"stop":871.446,"duration":13.23},{"text":"On UMW’s petition to rehear en banc the full court reconsidered spilt four to four and reinstated the judgments.","start":871.446,"stop":882.453,"duration":11.01},{"text":"Under the first question we raise here, we contend that the lower courts were in error.","start":882.453,"stop":888.499,"duration":6.05},{"text":"In holding that to be successful, the plaintiffs must show that this clearly authorized course of conduct of the international union and its offices must be such as to show antitrust violation not just by a preponderance of evidence.","start":888.499,"stop":904.708,"duration":16.21},{"text":"But this clearly authorize course of conduct must be such as to show clearly unequivocally and convincingly that antitrust law was violated.","start":904.708,"stop":915.062,"duration":10.35},{"text":"Now, Section 6 of Norris-LaGuardia by its very language expresses merely a rule of evidence in proving agency or authorization of acts in a labor dispute.","start":915.062,"stop":928.659,"duration":13.6},{"text":"The Section has nothing to say about legal standards applicable in evaluating clearly authorized course of conduct or clearly authorized acts in evaluating the legality of such acts.","start":928.659,"stop":942.853,"duration":14.19},{"text":"The act assumes that acts have been done in a labor dispute which violates the law and the statute is concerned with the proof of authorization of those acts.","start":942.853,"stop":955.188,"duration":12.34},{"text":"It has nothing to say about whether or not what legal standards are to be applied to determine whether the acts truly were unlawful.","start":955.188,"stop":965.424,"duration":10.24},{"text":"Now, all the issues in this case obviously can have nothing to do with authorization of the course of conduct in bargaining with the industry over 15 years of this international union and its officers.","start":965.424,"stop":978.468,"duration":13.04},{"text":"Obviously, the issues must be centered upon the legal standards to be applied to this course of conduct and the effects in consequences of that conduct over this period of time and neither the legislative history nor the opinions of this Court support the conclusions and construction below with the respect to Section 6.","start":978.468,"stop":1003.621,"duration":25.15},{"text":"The trial court found a UMW BCOA implicit agreement violating antitrust policy on a preponderance of evidence and we say this finding should have resulted in judgments for these plaintiffs.","start":1003.621,"stop":1020.121,"duration":16.5},{"text":"Under question two, we deal with the express language of the national contract in the Protective Wage Clause, paragraph “A” set forth at page 11 of our main brief.","start":1020.121,"stop":1034.17,"duration":14.05},{"text":"This language was demanded by the coal associations.","start":1034.17,"stop":1038.159,"duration":3.99},{"text":"It says that UMW will not enter into become a party to or permit any agreement or understanding other than national contract terms for the duration of the national contract.","start":1038.159,"stop":1051.426,"duration":13.27},{"text":"Now, the trial court went along with UMW’s we submit rather round about argument to restrict this restraint to the 82% of the industry that had signed up under the national contract.","start":1051.426,"stop":1070.155,"duration":18.73},{"text":"And the Court held that made it valid since the 18% for that that was not organized or was not included in the restraint.","start":1070.155,"stop":1080.461,"duration":10.31},{"text":"Now, we were contending that such a restraint is this, even if limited to the 82% of the industry including Southern Tennessee, the method -- hundreds of companies would be wiped out during the duration of the national contract without any freedom at all to bargain over modified terms over terms that were practical and workable in the situations that were present or that might develop during the life of the contract.","start":1080.461,"stop":1113.593,"duration":33.13},{"text":"And that this meant a deprivation of bargaining freedom for the duration of the national contract which was not amended again until 1964 at the end of the damage period of this case and we say it’s still goes on today that this matter of deprivation of bargaining freedom for great segments for the coal industry.","start":1113.593,"stop":1134.944,"duration":21.35},{"text":"The companies were induced to sign national contracts by all sorts of reasons mostly violence, but by economic pressure by all sorts also.","start":1134.944,"stop":1144.497,"duration":9.55},{"text":"And we say, it is a rule of law that will not work to say that the dominant companies can direct the union to keep all these companies under a contract, under impractical terms.","start":1144.497,"stop":1157.485,"duration":12.99},{"text":"The violence and the warfare of Southern Tennessee is just an example of the efforts of people to stay alive and maintain their only way of living in the face of such a rule and the struggle was going on in numerous coal fields that is shown by the many reported federal cases dealing with violence in this union in the period of 1959 or 1960.","start":1157.485,"stop":1184.093,"duration":26.61},{"text":"And the results could be predicted, they are obvious today repress competition rising coal prices set by in all the company of big energy companies.","start":1184.093,"stop":1193.821,"duration":9.73},{"text":"UMW in its reply brief now says, no restraint at all was put on UMW in this paragraph “A.”","start":1193.821,"stop":1202.988,"duration":9.17},{"text":"It says now, that the whole meaning of paragraph “A” is included within the last clause of the last sentence of that paragraph dealing with UMW’s obligation to enforce the contract against all signatories.","start":1202.988,"stop":1218.66,"duration":15.67},{"text":"It says now, that all the preceding language that UMW will not enter into become a party to or permit any agreement or understanding other the national contract terms for the duration of contract all that adds nothing to the meaning of the last clause about enforcing the contract against all signatories.","start":1218.66,"stop":1236.337,"duration":17.68},{"text":"Now, we submit that this present argument will not hold water as a bare reading of the clause demonstrates.","start":1236.337,"stop":1244.172,"duration":7.84},{"text":"To say nothing of the fact that this language was demanded by the major coal associations.","start":1244.172,"stop":1251.889,"duration":7.72},{"text":"UMW’s brief argues that even if this paragraph did impose a restraint on UMW’s bargaining freedom, still UMW had a legal right to a uniform wage scale throughout the industry and therefore the paragraph does not express anything other than what UMW had a legal right to do anyway.","start":1251.889,"stop":1274.037,"duration":22.15},{"text":"But we think the answer to that is, that even if UMW did have a right to engage in this kind of bargaining with the dominant unit and showing this a resulting contracts down, all these other -- upon all these other units over this period of 15 years still it did not have a legal right to bind itself for the major coal associations and companies to pursue that policy in the industry.","start":1274.037,"stop":1303.528,"duration":29.49},{"text":"Clearly, this is what UMW has done to the suppression of a great segment of the coal industry.","start":1303.528,"stop":1310.424,"duration":6.9},{"text":"Now, third question that brought us to the three questions we raised, we assert that there should be at least a prima facie case of antitrust violation from the union’s force of conduct and the effects and consequences over this period of time of that conduct even without the undisputed proof that the coal associations were making demands upon UMW to restraint it in its bargaining policy.","start":1310.424,"stop":1340.693,"duration":30.27},{"text":"Now, the lower court decisions emphasized exclusively the right, so called right of the union to have a uniform wage scale throughout an industry and obviously the courts think this means that the union can deal in bona fide bargaining only with the dominant unit and can carry out this practice of going through the so called negotiations but never changing a single common, a single contract with the single unit of the hundreds of other units who role this period with all these varying circumstances and with the obvious repression of competition is going on like I said in Tennessee.","start":1340.693,"stop":1380.754,"duration":40.06},{"text":"Now, we say that this emphasis on a uniform wage scale really gives no right whatsoever, no recognition, no reconciliation to rights of the hundreds of all the units not only under antitrust law but also under national labor policy and national employment policy.","start":1380.754,"stop":1404.047,"duration":23.29},{"text":"The lower court decisions subordinate obviously the antitrust law in this case allowing this iron bound completely unfair uniformity policy direct economic devastation over a three county area for three years to say nothing about the effects nationally.","start":1404.047,"stop":1424.65,"duration":20.6},{"text":"The lower court decisions frustrate the most basic purposes of national labor policy, making it obviously impossible for hundreds of employers to deal and any freedom at all with their employees of that terms and conditions where they are situated, making the conflict in the turmoil and finally open warfare shown in Tennessee absolutely necessary the very things which the National Labor statutes expressly were passed to avoid the conflict, the turmoil.","start":1424.65,"stop":1462.71,"duration":38.06},{"text":"The lower court decisions ignored completely the National Employment Act which act was passed six years after the Apex decision.","start":1462.71,"stop":1473.969,"duration":11.26},{"text":"The National Labor Act -- Employment Act says that our national employment policy shall be such as to promote the free enterprise system, the free competitive enterprise system and it says that our national employment policy shall be such as to promote those conditions which afford maximum employment.","start":1473.969,"stop":1496.622,"duration":22.65},{"text":"Now, this policy is obviously frustrated by the lower court decisions which require that these hundreds of all the companies stick to the demands of the UMW BCOA unit that they fire great masses of their employees and substitute heavy machinery or be destroyed throughout of business.","start":1496.622,"stop":1518.72,"duration":22.1},{"text":"Now, the joined economic committee of Congress has spoken out strongly in recent years about this very kind of anti-competitive and anti-job rulemaking policy.","start":1518.72,"stop":1532.038,"duration":13.32},{"text":"But we say that the principle answer to this present reliance upon a so called uniform wage scale throughout an industry is the fact that paragraph “A” was demanded by the major coal associations and the court found on a preponderance of evidence that this was intended to be applied not just to the 82% of industry but to the 100% of the industry.","start":1532.038,"stop":1555.533,"duration":23.49},{"text":"Now, we don’t think that the multi-employer bargaining rules cut across this case at
