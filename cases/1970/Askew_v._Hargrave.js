discussed yesterday is a very complicated formula which takes into account a myriad of factors, it could take -- if there are infinite number of reasonable formulas for determining instruction units, to take account of any reasonable difference in educational need, transportation, exceptional children, guidance programs, anything so that we wouldn’t object to any limitation which applied without

potential gap is less than if there’s a limitation of 15 mills and a limitation of 15 mills creates less of a potential gap than no limitation at all but the question that we urge on the Court is not
