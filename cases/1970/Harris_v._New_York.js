under such circumstances could not be used.","start":263.969,"stop":276.266,"duration":12.3},{"text":"That was the word you used and I prefer to admissibility because “used” and “admissibility” have some distinctions in this case.","start":276.266,"stop":284.401,"duration":8.13},{"text":"But what I am saying is this, when he asked for a lawyer, it was not only a question of rights were available to him because he didn’t appreciate what they were at all.","start":284.401,"stop":296.764,"duration":12.36},{"text":"But the prosecutor did lo and behold ,when you get to the end of this statement, the prosecutor says to him, “By the way, when you kept on going after you asked for a lawyer, you meant to waive a lawyer, didn’t you?”","start":296.764,"stop":307.868,"duration":11.1},{"text":"And Viven Harris said, “Huh?”","start":307.868,"stop":310.82,"duration":2.95},{"text":"He didn’t understand.","start":310.82,"stop":313.174,"duration":2.35},{"text":"And the young lady from New York County makes a point in her brief that they explained it to him.","start":313.174,"stop":318.477,"duration":5.3},{"text":"Well, they told him what the word waiver meant but they didn’t tell him a thing about the consequences of it, not three-word explanation.","start":318.477,"stop":325.749,"duration":7.27},{"text":"So Mr. Harris found himself in what I believe to be the situation of the type of defendant that you have been most alert to protect, one who is in no position to comprehend or to appreciate what right it is he said to have waived because he doesn’t understand the nature of it at that time.","start":325.749,"stop":347.449,"duration":21.7},{"text":"Now, when you come to the question of fairness to law enforcement officers, it is suggested that well, as Mr. Justice Stewart raised, maybe that wasn’t the law at the time.","start":347.449,"stop":360.518,"duration":13.07},{"text":"I think that law was reasonably inferable from what this Court had been doing and I think the prosecutor did infer or he wouldn’t have asked him about the waiver which is the traditional way of trying to get around Miranda.","start":360.518,"stop":372.844,"duration":12.33},{"text":"But something more important happened and that was the decision of this Court in Johnson, because on the day that Mr. Harris came to trial, there wasn’t any question about what the law was.","start":372.844,"stop":385.013,"duration":12.17},{"text":"His legal aid attorney try one of his first cases, knew exactly what the law was and made the proper objections.","start":385.013,"stop":392.49,"duration":7.48},{"text":"The judge and perhaps it’s the reason we respect him so highly, pointed out to the prosecuting attorneys that if you do this, it
