different.","start":627.151,"stop":634.654,"duration":7.5},{"text":"It's quite the opposite of the ordinary so called symbolic speech case.","start":634.654,"stop":639.768,"duration":5.11},{"text":"In the usual symbolic speech case, the statute on its face prohibits conduct which the state has a right to prohibit and the defendant comes in and argues that since he employed that conduct for communicative purposes, then the First Amendment prohibits the application of the statute to him.","start":639.768,"stop":659.979,"duration":20.21},{"text":"That's not this case.","start":659.979,"stop":661.87,"duration":1.89},{"text":"In this case, the point of the statute under which appellant has been convicted prohibits communication; communication of an idea, contempt.","start":661.87,"stop":671.941,"duration":10.07},{"text":"And if it's applied to symbolic conduct, it would be applied to the communicative aspect of the conduct.","start":671.941,"stop":678.533,"duration":6.59},{"text":"What the statute prohibits here is the communicative aspect of the conduct and not the conduct itself.","start":678.533,"stop":686.268,"duration":7.74},{"text":"Hence, even if we assume that this is not pure speech, the question before the Court would therefore be not whether conduct prohibited by a statute is protected by the First Amendment, but whether the Constitution permits a statue to be directed entirely at communication, solely because the means of communication could be an act subject to state control.","start":686.268,"stop":712.119,"duration":25.85},{"text":"Now, we do contend however that we are dealing here with speech not with so called symbolic speech, or with conduct

protest.","start":771.839,"stop":777.013,"duration":5.17},{"text":"In the Instant case, the courts below have found that these sculptures were political protests.","start":777.013,"stop":783.197,"duration":6.18},{"text":"At the same time, we don't discount our contention of all works of art, whether or not they communicate a political message, are protected by the First Amendment.","start":783.197,"stop":795.478,"duration":12.28},{"text":"Now, it should be noted here that the statutory language which forbids casting contempt on the flag precludes punishment of an artist for using the flag to praise United States policy.","start":795.478,"stop":808.148,"duration":12.67},{"text":"On its face, the statute permits the artist to use the flag in support of United States policy, but forbids them to use it if he would condemn U.S. policy.","start":808.148,"stop":818.117,"duration":9.97},{"text":"Whether he would condemn it in the case
