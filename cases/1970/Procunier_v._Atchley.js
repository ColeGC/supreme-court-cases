Granucci","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":18.479,"stop":23.401,"duration":4.92},{"text":"This is another chapter, and we hope the final chapter, in a story of a criminal prosecution that commenced in 1958.","start":23.401,"stop":32.792,"duration":9.39},{"text":"This case comes here after the United States District Court in a decision affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ordered the State of California to hold a new hearing in the State Courts on the question of whether Atchley’s confession was voluntarily given, which confession was introduced to this trial over objection and a lengthy hearing at the trial.","start":32.792,"stop":62.431,"duration":29.64},{"text":"The question have been reviewed and affirmed by Unite-- by a unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court of California and the decisions of the State Courts which were, adverse to Atchley, brought to this Court.","start":62.431,"stop":80.132,"duration":17.7},{"text":"I think the issue that is really presented today is whether a State Supreme Court decision on the merits of a federal claim in a criminal case can be given a presumption of correctness in Federal Habeas Corpus proceedings.","start":80.132,"stop":95.668,"duration":15.54},{"text":"Now, if the answer to that question is in the negative, then the state appellate review of federal constitutional claims in criminal cases is an utter waste of time for everyone concerned, and State Appellate Courts would be well advised to relegate criminal defendants to the Criminal Courts for the immediate litigation of their constitutional arguments.","start":95.668,"stop":123.068,"duration":27.4},{"text":"Now, by way of procedural background, Atchley was convicted of murder in January 1959, after a jury trial in the Superior Court for Butte County, California.","start":123.068,"stop":135.864,"duration":12.8},{"text":"Because he was sentenced to death, and incidentally that sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment and then commuted again to allow him the possibility of parole for which he is presently eligible, his appeal to the California State Supreme Court was automatic.","start":135.864,"stop":156.081,"duration":20.22},{"text":"That Court affirmed the conviction in a unanimous opinion authored by then Associate Justice Traynor, to which we will refer in some detail later.","start":156.081,"stop":167.233,"duration":11.15},{"text":"Suffice to say at this point, the principal issue raised by Atchley on his state appeal was whether his confession was voluntarily made.","start":167.233,"stop":176.407,"duration":9.17},{"text":"The California Supreme Court concluded that it was.","start":176.407,"stop":180.852,"duration":4.44},{"text":"Atchley then came to this Court on a petition for writ of certiorari, which was granted.","start":180.852,"stop":187.12,"duration":6.27},{"text":"Briefs were filed.","start":187.12,"stop":188.325,"duration":1.2},{"text":"The record was filed and the case was argued but after hearing argument and examining the record of the state proceedings, this Court dismissed the writ as improvidently granted.","start":188.325,"stop":200.017,"duration":11.69},{"text":"Shortly thereafter, Atchley filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Northern District of California.","start":200.017,"stop":207.625,"duration":7.61},{"text":"This was denied summarily, and the denial was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.","start":207.625,"stop":215.659,"duration":8.03},{"text":"In 1967, Atchley filed a second petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal Court for the Northern District of California.","start":215.659,"stop":228.716,"duration":13.06},{"text":"That petition challenged the admission into evidence of a tape recorded confession which he had given to his friend, an insurance agent, one Ray Travers, the same issue that had been presented to the California Supreme Court.","start":228.716,"stop":244.867,"duration":16.15},{"text":"The District Court granted the writ.","start":244.867,"stop":248.537,"duration":3.67},{"text":"It did not say that Atchley’s confession was involuntary.","start":248.537,"stop":253.186,"duration":4.65},{"text":"Indeed, the Court admitted that it could not say that Atchley’s confession was involuntary.","start":253.186,"stop":259.339,"duration":6.15},{"text":"The District Court avoided the necessity of passing on that issue by holding that the procedure followed in the State Trial Court was not fully adequate to achieve a reliable determination that Atchley’s confession was voluntary.","start":259.339,"stop":274.645,"duration":15.31},{"text":"By the order of the District Court, we are relegated to the State Courts for a further hearing on this issue with the possibility of further appeals in the State and Federal Courts, and Atchley loses again.","start":274.645,"stop":287.303,"duration":12.66},{"text":"We say that the District Court erred in refusing to apply the presumption of correctness contained in Title 28 United States Code Section 2254 (d) which was enacted in 1956.","start":287.303,"stop":304.433,"duration":17.13},{"text":"The Trial Court re-- the District Court refused to apply the presumption for two reasons.","start":304.433,"stop":309.461,"duration":5.03},{"text":"One, the District Court concluded that a clear-cut determination of voluntariness did not appear on the State Court record.","start":309.461,"stop":318.614,"duration":9.15},{"text":"Secondly, the District Court stated that the Trial Court had applied an erroneous legal standard.","start":318.614,"stop":325.355,"duration":6.74},{"text":"We respectfully submit that the District Court was wrong for three distinct reasons.","start":325.355,"stop":333.597,"duration":8.24},{"text":"First, there was a definite ruling on the merits of Atchley’s constitutional claim in both the Trial Court and the California Supreme Court.","start":333.597,"stop":345.275,"duration":11.68},{"text":"The District Court totally ignored the independent review of the California Supreme Court, focused its attention on the Trial Court.","start":345.275,"stop":351.845,"duration":6.57},{"text":"It was wrong in both instances.","start":351.845,"stop":354.102,"duration":2.26},{"text":"First of all, as regard to Trial Court, I point out that California is a jurisdiction that adheres to the Massachusetts or Humane Rule in determining the admissibility of confessions.","start":354.102,"stop":367.112,"duration":13.01},{"text":"That is to say, the question of voluntariness is one that is to be determined, first of all, by the trial judge and, if the trial judge finds the confession voluntarily made, the confession is again submitted-- is submitted to the jury for a second albeit redundant determination of the voluntariness question.","start":367.112,"stop":390.365,"duration":23.25},{"text":"This Court, in Jackson versus Denno and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Black, has indeed recognized that California does follow the Massachusetts or Humane Rule.","start":390.365,"stop":403.728,"duration":13.36},{"text":"Now, Atchley had a ruling on the voluntariness of his confession when the Trial Court, over objection, allowed the confession to go to the jury on the issue of guilt.","start":403.728,"stop":420.413,"duration":16.69},{"text":"While the Trial Court did not give detail and specific instructions on the question of voluntariness to the jury, this is unnecessary for purposes of federal review, because all that Jackson d-- versus Denno requires is that the trial judge make a determination.","start":420.413,"stop":437.74,"duration":17.33},{"text":"When that is done, the question of whether to submit the matter to the jury for a second determination is solely one of state law.","start":437.74,"stop":449.08,"duration":11.34},{"text":"So, there were complaints with Jackson versus Denno in the Trial Court and there was also a definite ruling on the merits by the California Supreme Court.","start":449.08,"stop":459.292,"duration":10.21},{"text":"That Court exercised the power of independent review and found the confession voluntary.","start":459.292,"stop":469.092,"duration":9.8},{"text":"Now, the District Court, we submit, erred in holding that the material facts were not fully developed.","start":469.092,"stop":476.585,"duration":7.49},{"text":"Each of the alleged inadequacies relied on by the District Court in the development of the facts can be answered by an examination of the straight-- state trial record and the opinion of the California Supreme Court.","start":476.585,"stop":492.752,"duration":16.17},{"text":"First of all, the fact that Atchley was trying to contact a particular attorney in San Jose, and this is a point that the District Court said wasn’t sufficiently explored, well this was brought out in the trial record.","start":492.752,"stop":509.36,"duration":16.61},{"text":"It was considered by the California Supreme Court.","start":509.36,"stop":513.75,"duration":4.39},{"text":"In this case, the record also showed that Atchley was not an indigent.","start":513.75,"stop":518.936,"duration":5.19},{"text":"He was a man who ran a used car business, speculated in small parcels of property.","start":518.936,"stop":525.849,"duration":6.91},{"text":"He had an access to-- he had access to the telephone while he was under arrest, and he had retained local attorneys to carry on some civil litigation in connection with his business activities.","start":525.849,"stop":540.182,"duration":14.33},{"text":"In any event, Atchley spontaneously confessed to a third party, and that is why, even if there was a clear-cut showing of denial of counsel, it would have little, if any, weight under these circumstances.","start":540.182,"stop":557.789,"duration":17.61},{"text":"California Supreme Court also considered the point and, moreover, Escobedo, which was a first decision by this Court to specifically make a request for counsel and the denial thereof determinative in a confession case, Escobedo is not retroactively applied.","start":557.789,"stop":583.432,"duration":25.64},{"text":"The second point that the District Court said was inadequately developed was Travers’ concealment from Atchley of his motives for having a second conversation.","start":583.432,"stop":595.256,"duration":11.82},{"text":"Now, I would point out, although it’s spelled out in great detail in the briefs, I would point out for the illumination of the Court at this point that there were two conversations.","start":595.256,"stop":609.225,"duration":13.97},{"text":"About two days after he was arrested, Mr. Atchley called his insurance agent, one Ray Travers.","start":609.225,"stop":615.942,"duration":6.72},{"text":"He called him down to the jail to talk about the circumstances of his insurance, the changes that resulted from his condition of arrest.","start":615.942,"stop":625.136,"duration":9.19},{"text":"Now at that time, spontaneously, without any involvement of law enforcement, Atchley admitted to Travers that he had fired the shots that killed his wife.","start":625.136,"stop":643.88,"duration":18.74},{"text":"Travers reported this to the police.","start":643.88,"stop":647.469,"duration":3.59},{"text":"The police asked Travers if he would go back and get a second statement from Atchley that they would tape record.","start":647.469,"stop":654.817,"duration":7.35},{"text":"He agreed to do so because, and this appears in the record, he had told Atchley that he was coming back to get further information in any event.","start":654.817,"stop":663.798,"duration":8.98},{"text":"Now, it’s a second of these statements-- the second statement that was tape recorded, that was at issue here.","start":663.798,"stop":673.621,"duration":9.82},{"text":"In any event, the Supreme Court reviewed this matter of deception and held that this would not make a statement involuntary because it was not the sort of deception that would be likely to produce an untrustworthy statement.","start":673.621,"stop":689.322,"duration":15.7},{"text":"Third, the District Court said that the fact that Atchley did not know that the conversation would be recorded, that this wasn’t adequately developed, but it was in the record.","start":689.322,"stop":702.352,"duration":13.03},{"text":"It was considered by the California Supreme Court, and Atchley’s lack of knowledge of this point would hardly put on any pressure on him to confess.","start":702.352,"stop":712.78,"duration":10.43},{"text":"Finally-- no, fourth, what the officers said to Travers, again, this was relied on by the District Court, but this wasn’t material to Atchley’s state of mind.","start":712.78,"stop":723.73,"duration":10.95},{"text":"There’s no question that Travers was acting on behalf of law enforcement at the time the second confession was given.","start":723.73,"stop":730.72,"duration":6.99},{"text":"We don’t deny that at all.","start":730.72,"stop":733.115,"duration":2.39},{"text":"Fifth evidence of his mental condition, says the District Court, was not adequately developed.","start":733.115,"stop":739.54,"duration":6.42},{"text":"But, Atchley did not offer evidence of his state of mind at the time he made the confession.","start":739.54,"stop":744.875,"duration":5.34},{"text":"His offer of proof is the state of mind at his trial when only to the time of the shooting.","start":744.875,"stop":753.373,"duration":8.5},{"text":"The District Court also said that Atchley should’ve been allowed to develop proof of his education, his limited background.","start":753.373,"stop":761.086,"duration":7.71},{"text":"Well, the Trial Court, when the prosecution objected to this t-- the proof of this nature, overruled the prosecution objection and allowed defense counsel to proceed.","start":761.086,"stop":777.127,"duration":16.04},{"text":"However, the reason this point wasn’t developed is that defense counsel went on to another line of inquiry, and that appears at 147.","start":777.127,"stop":786.251,"duration":9.12}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.
