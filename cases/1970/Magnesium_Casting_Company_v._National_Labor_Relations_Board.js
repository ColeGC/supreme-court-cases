enforce a decision and order in an unfair labor practice case which is based upon evidence in the transcript that it has never considered or reviewed and based upon a conflicting testimony by witnesses that the Board or its Trial Examiner neither heard or observed.","start":45.097,"stop":86.866,"duration":41.77},{"text":"The background of this case involves the filing of a petition for an election by a union and a so-called representation case called in our case and appellants of the trade as distinguished from a “C” case which is unfair labor practice charge.","start":86.866,"stop":104.115,"duration":17.25},{"text":"And the hearing was held, conflicting evidence was presented and one of the questions involved particularly whether or not the

testimony.","start":123.501,"stop":130.628,"duration":7.13},{"text":"And this question as to supervisors became critical because the company had evidence that an employee that it contended was a supervisor was acting as an agent for the Union in soliciting authorization cards for the Union.","start":130.628,"stop":148.396,"duration":17.77},{"text":"This would taint the interest of the Union because the Board has held that the solicitation of cards by an employee or representative is an unfair labor practice.","start":148.396,"stop":156.866,"duration":8.47},{"text":"It is coercive and it

presumably.","start":443.959,"stop":454.848,"duration":10.89},{"text":"In any event, subsequent through his decision these conflicts in Scott’s testimony and the contrary testimony of other witnesses were called to the Board’s attention in a motion to review and the Board refused to review because that has set up standard in a representation case.","start":454.848,"stop":471.849,"duration":17},{"text":"Now, we can't quarrel with them because the statute gives a Board the authority to set up this stand with and give them discretionary

refused to review.","start":487.408,"stop":489.366,"duration":1.96},{"text":"The election results then were certified and the Union was certified as the bargaining agent.","start":489.366,"stop":495.542,"duration":6.18},{"text":"And the company position having bend that the employees were coerced because of the supervisors organizational activities on behalf of the Union and under law in case history, the only method for raising this issue was to refuse to bargain with the Union and a complaint would issue and this is what was done so that the employer could have a determination under Section 10 of the Act.","start":495.542,"stop":526.197,"duration":30.66},{"text":"There was no burden of proof incidentally on the Board or its agents in a representation
