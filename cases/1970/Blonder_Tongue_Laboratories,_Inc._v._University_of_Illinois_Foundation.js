out straight, that’s Isbell.","start":521.554,"stop":533.207,"duration":11.65},{"text":"Then they had a second patent the Mayes who just took these rods and bent them in this way into a

appealed.","start":546.592,"stop":551.997,"duration":5.4},{"text":"However, one issue that is involved is that at the time that they obtained this Mayes patent in the Patent Office, counsel who were prosecuting both the Isbell and Mayes patents together filed an affidavit in the Patent Office which we maintain was fraudulent as a result of which this Mayes patent issue.","start":551.997,"stop":575.251,"duration":23.25},{"text":"That affidavit concerned both inventions, both Isbell patent and the Mayes patent inventions and one of our contentions is that the Court of Appeals having reversed Judge Hoffman and find that this affidavit was less than candid and that it was deliberately given to mislead the Patent Office that one of the questions we raised is whether under those circumstances, there should be any standing in equity on either patents for the plaintiff.","start":575.251,"stop":602.892,"duration":27.64},{"text":"And also involved in our case is the fact that the minute, the fruits of this fraud were obtained, out in the market place they went with copious advertisements telling the whole world they invented the broad log periodic antenna, nobody else could make one and this coupled with a whole series of other acts almost put our client out of a business.","start":602.892,"stop":624.043,"duration":21.15},{"text":"So that we have a counterclaim which is in point 2, if you will, question number 4 now before this Court as to whether this is fair competition and whether this is not violative of the antitrust laws to take the fruits of an illegally obtained patent and use it the way it was used in the marketplace to suppress competition.","start":624.043,"stop":644.017,"duration":19.97},{"text":"Turning back for the moment to the obviousness of the Isbell patent, at the time that Isbell made his invention, this whole magic of log periodicity had been invented long since as Judge Hoffman found, in the early 1950’s, at the University of Illinois.","start":644.017,"stop":662.165,"duration":18.15},{"text":"It’s very simple.","start":662.165,"stop":663.441,"duration":1.28},{"text":"What it means is that in order to have your television antenna, listen to all of the channels from the low frequencies to the high frequencies, we pit in a whole bunch of these antennas and we tuned them to different frequencies and if you shape them in the way that they go from the long wavelengths, down to the short wavelengths, just taper the shape, that’s a log-width variation, that’s all it means and if you space it also in accordance with the length that again is a log-width in variation.","start":663.441,"stop":693.704,"duration":30.26},{"text":"Those principles and that discovery, we all admit was known before Isbell came into the scene.","start":693.704,"stop":700.149,"duration":6.45},{"text":"What then that Isbell claim was his invention?","start":700.149,"stop":703.914,"duration":3.76},{"text":"“Uh-huh,” he said, other people while they have done that variation of having long shorter, shorter, shorter, shorter, shorter, while they have done that before, they didn’t do with the simple single wire.","start":703.914,"stop":718.944,"duration":15.03},{"text":"They did it of what he calls “teeth.”","start":718.944,"stop":720.861,"duration":1.92},{"text":"You see this a little a triangular teeth and they didn’t take and just use one wire instead of the tooth.","start":720.861,"stop":730.394,"duration":9.53},{"text":"So this is supposedly what Mr. Isbell invented, but when Mr. Harris, their expert got on the stand, he admitted to us as shown in the record here that the ideas of these teeth or straight lines, or folded lines, these were all well-known dipoles, all well-known antennas and in fact, they all operate the same way to produce the same result.","start":730.394,"stop":757.993,"duration":27.6},{"text":"I would like to hold up for you from appendix, volume 2, if I may, page 475, the sketches that their witness, Mr. Harris put on the board and which we transcribed on the paper, 475 and 476 where he shows, if Your Honors please, First, the straight lines, that’s the straight line dipoles so-called of Isbell.","start":757.993,"stop":794.03,"duration":36.04},{"text":"And up above what he shows what the current is, this loop dash line, that means the radio currents go across the antenna in that kind of a distribution.","start":794.03,"stop":803.458,"duration":9.43},{"text":"Then on the next page, Mr. Harris, their expert, sketches these triangular loops such as I showed you in items 6 and he shows the same current distribution.","start":803.458,"stop":816.46,"duration":13},{"text":"And below that he shows that you could fold the wire into a rectangular loop and get the same current distribution.","start":816.46,"stop":823.113,"duration":6.65},{"text":"And there's no dispute but that all of these antennas were known long before Isbell, decades.","start":823.113,"stop":829.339,"duration":6.23},{"text":"So, that the question resolves itself into, can you give us many patents as there are well-known types of antenna shapes by just magically putting them in this whole formula for log periodicity?","start":829.339,"stop":844.23,"duration":14.89},{"text":"And this is what the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit found to answer in a negative, but this is what Judge Hoffman answered in the affirmative.","start":844.23,"stop":854.03,"duration":9.8},{"text":"Now, why?","start":854.03,"stop":856.708,"duration":2.68},{"text":"Judge Hoffman was impressed by Mr. DuHamel’s testimony that he was surprised that these straight line elements would work.","start":856.708,"stop":867.263,"duration":10.56},{"text":"Though he said after he thought about it, he realized they would, but when was he surprised?","start":867.263,"stop":873.678,"duration":6.41},{"text":"There is absolutely nothing in this record showing that it was not obvious at the time Mr. Isbell proposed to change from a thick antenna to a thin wire that it was not obvious and Judge Hoffman did not find that it was not obvious at the time Isbell made the invention.","start":873.678,"stop":894.16,"duration":20.48},{"text":"He just said, at some time it was not predictable whether these different kinds of things would work, but the statute says, we’re concerned in Section 103 with obviousness at the time of the invention.","start":894.16,"stop":907.448,"duration":13.29},{"text":"And fortunately, we were able to put in a document which was contemporary that Mr. Isbell’s invention, a document of the University of Illinois Laboratory itself whereas we quote in our brief and we produce this only two pages long, in the first part, they say, “Now, we can predict from the mathematics the operation of multi-element log periodic antennas” and then on a lower paragraph it says, “Mr. Isbell is going to thin this down now into zero with almost little wires.”","start":907.448,"stop":941.657,"duration":34.21},{"text":"And that document itself contemporaneous not in the anticipation of lawsuits shows beyond any reasonable doubt even if these were criminal test that at that time it was completely obvious to those skilled in the art that Isbell’s trivial change was an experiment but not something that was unobvious to those skilled in the
