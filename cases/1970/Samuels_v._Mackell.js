think.","start":640.257,"stop":648.96,"duration":8.7},{"text":"It said that this statute is clearly impermissible under current constitutional standards and it discussed subdivision 3 which is one of

will not be argued here today that the Gitlow interpretation is any longer a valid interpretation under the doctrine, even if Dennis for that matter because even Dennis in that opinion suggested that the Gitlow case was really doubtful, and that in many standards inconsistent with, as I say a larger range of cases, the Scales case, the (Inaudible) case, and the whole range of constitutional decisions in the last 10 years of this Court.","start":675.595,"stop":708.455,"duration":32.86},{"text":"So that I think that the situation is very similar to the Shuttlesworth

wrong.","start":722.898,"stop":746.908,"duration":24.01},{"text":"Now here, we have not the Chief of Police holding -- giving the statute an unconstitutional interpretation, but the New York Court of Appeals giving what is today an unconstitutional interpretation.","start":746.908,"stop":759.268,"duration":12.36},{"text":"Although, obviously, at the time of the Gitlow decision that ipso facto was unconstitutional interpretation because the Court so said so.","start":759.268,"stop":767.913,"duration":8.64}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Of course the point in the Shuttlesworth was a little different as you know.","start":767.913,"stop":772.362,"duration":4.45},{"text":"It involved the fact that the licensing authority could not be charged with

Epton case, the Court found it quite sufficient that there was a finding of clear and present danger to commit a riot.","start":866.258,"stop":876.098,"duration":9.84},{"text":"Now, if the all that the clear and present danger test means in the eyes of the New York Court of Appeals, and if that is the cause placed on the statute now, is that the crime of sedition requires only that there be a clear and present danger of this order which is a far cry from the overthrow of the Government of the United States, or even the overthrow of the Government of New York, then I submit that we still have a statute that is unconstitutional even under the Epton decision.","start":876.098,"stop":907.132,"duration":31.03},{"text":"Now, in Dombrowski, this Court held that it will not abstain in a case
