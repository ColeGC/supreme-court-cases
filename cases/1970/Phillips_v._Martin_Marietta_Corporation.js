category.","start":516.494,"stop":525.008,"duration":8.51},{"text":"The second reason we submit that the decision below should be reversed is that it conflicts with the language of the Act.","start":525.008,"stop":533.454,"duration":8.45},{"text":"Section 703 on its face would seem to prohibit the policy of refusing to hire women with pre-school-age children while at the same time hiring men with pre-school-age children, the Act declares that it shall be an unlawful employment practice to fail or refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of such individual's sex.","start":533.454,"stop":564.437,"duration":30.98},{"text":"The Court of Appeals attempted to avoid this plain

so.","start":605.388,"stop":616.517,"duration":11.13},{"text":"Restricting the sex-plus doctrine just to the notion of women with pre-school-age children.","start":616.517,"stop":625.924,"duration":9.41},{"text":"It would exclude, based on a recent study done by the Department of Labor, 4.2 million women currently in the labor force from the

them.","start":625.924,"stop":644.475,"duration":18.55},{"text":"This would go far toward vitiating the Act, but of course the sex-plus doctrine can easily be extended just as to women.","start":644.475,"stop":654.011,"duration":9.54},{"text":"For example, an employer could, under this doctrine, announce a decision to refuse to hire based on sex-plus marital status or sex-plus

plus.","start":679.697,"stop":694.403,"duration":14.71},{"text":"For example, an employer could then refuse to hire Negroes with chunky hair, or on the other hand Negroes with straight
