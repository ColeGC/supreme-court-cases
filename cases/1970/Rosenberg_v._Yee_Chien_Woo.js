place.","start":740.71,"stop":758.471,"duration":17.76},{"text":"Now, I believe the “not a national language” which was inserted for the first time in 1960 had an entirely different purpose from that envisaged by the Ninth Circuit.","start":758.471,"stop":770.575,"duration":12.1},{"text":"The court, unlike the Second Circuit which is I say considered this with great care, the court below overlooked the fact that the 1960 Act was tied to the mandate of the United Nations, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.","start":770.575,"stop":788.53,"duration":17.95},{"text":"The mandate of the High Commissioner, which is incorporated in a U.N. statute specifically declares, among other things, that his mandate shall not extend to refugees situated in the country of their

formulation.","start":805.287,"stop":811.872,"duration":6.58},{"text":"Now when that formulation was carried over into the 1965 Act, which succeeded these laws, I believe Congress had in mind the change in world conditions that had occurred by that time, in 1965.","start":811.872,"stop":827.92,"duration":16.05},{"text":"In the original refugee laws, Congress confronted a world, Europe particularly that was shattered by war.","start":827.92,"stop":835.696,"duration":7.78},{"text":"The countries of Europe, even the countries which were receiving their own nationals were unable to care for such nationals and therefore, the United States pitched in and helped.","start":835.696,"stop":848.761,"duration":13.06},{"text":"And in the earlier refugee laws, there was specific provision for the reception of Greek, Dutch, German and other ethnic refugees who were situated in the country of their nationality, Italian I believe is the other one.","start":848.761,"stop":868.428,"duration":19.67},{"text":"Now, by the time the 1965 law was being considered, the situations as I said had changed.","start":868.428,"stop":874.925,"duration":6.5},{"text":"Congress I believe concluded that these nations were now able to care for their own refugees and therefore, it inserted this proviso that it would not extend to refugees who were in their own countries, the countries of their nationality.","start":874.925,"stop":891.665,"duration":16.74},{"text":"Now particularly, I call Your Honors' attention to the situation of West Germany, which may have been in the mind of Congress, which previously had been the beneficiary of all the refugee laws which had been previously enacted.","start":891.665,"stop":908.026,"duration":16.36},{"text":"By the application of the “not a national” proviso, Congress apparently were saying that since Germany had now fully recovered, the

help.","start":908.026,"stop":927.744,"duration":19.72},{"text":"I think, this is the basis for the adoption by Congress of the “not a national” proviso and it seems to me completely without warrant

displaced.","start":927.744,"stop":951.937,"duration":24.19},{"text":"Our briefs recite the consistent administrative interpretation which has found that benefit under these refugees statutes are not
