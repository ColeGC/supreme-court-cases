into any closed area and at each visit the child was seen.","start":204.504,"stop":213.784,"duration":9.28},{"text":"Ultimately, she notified a caseworker who had sought to make an appointment by

talk at home because that would violate her right of privacy.","start":228.282,"stop":249.104,"duration":20.82},{"text":"The referee found that refusal to comply with the policy of contact by home visit justified the case -- closing the case, pointing out and I quote from his opinion, “The home visit which Mrs. James refuses to permit is for the purpose of determining if there are any changes in her situation that might effect her eligibility to continue to receive public assistance or that might affect the amount of such assistance and to see if there are any social services which the department of social services can provide to the family.”","start":249.104,"stop":286.741,"duration":37.64},{"text":"He, therefore, affirmed the decision to close the

without a warrant.","start":295.091,"stop":308.782,"duration":13.69},{"text":"A statutory three-judged court was convened and its majority opinion, the court held that a home visit without a warrant

the client to disclose the terms of his eligibility.","start":321.219,"stop":343.733,"duration":22.51},{"text":"The majority rejected any idea that the home visit could legitimately ascertain the

child.","start":343.733,"stop":363.544,"duration":19.81},{"text":"The first point to be made, I think, is that the home visit as presently structured is a reasonable and necessary investigative tool
