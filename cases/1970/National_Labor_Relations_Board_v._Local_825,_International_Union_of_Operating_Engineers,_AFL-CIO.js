Court.","start":41.812,"stop":45.467,"duration":3.66},{"text":"These two cases consolidated here are here on writs of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.","start":45.467,"stop":53.428,"duration":7.96},{"text":"In broad terms, the questions presented in both these cases is whether the Union, Local 825, of the Operating Engineers violated Section 8 (b) 4 (b) of the National Labor Relations Act in the so-called secondary boycott provision by exerting coercive pressures upon neutral employers in support of its dispute with the primary employer, the White Construction Company.","start":53.428,"stop":81.921,"duration":28.49},{"text":"Now, that question can be further refined.","start":81.921,"stop":84.958,"duration":3.04},{"text":"All parties and the Board and the Court below are in agreement here that the Union did exert coercive pressures as defined by Section 8 (b) 4 (b) upon neutral employers.","start":84.958,"stop":101.657,"duration":16.7},{"text":"Now, that statutory section further requires, for purposes relevant here, that such coercive conduct have, as an object, forcing or requiring an employer to seize doing business with any other person.","start":101.657,"stop":122.236,"duration":20.58},{"text":"Now, this is the pivotal issue in the case.","start":122.236,"stop":125.439,"duration":3.2},{"text":"The Board found that the Union’s coercive conduct had cessation of business as it read the statute, in the statutory sense, as an object of its conduct and the Board, therefore, found a violation of Section 8 (b) 4 (b).","start":125.439,"stop":142.049,"duration":16.61},{"text":"The Court below disagreed.","start":142.049,"stop":144.338,"duration":2.29},{"text":"Unlike the Board and unlike other Courts of Appeals which have considered this issue, the Court below reads the language in the statute quite literally.","start":144.338,"stop":156.182,"duration":11.84},{"text":"On the basis of that literal reading, the Court below held that the proof was insufficient to prove that the Union had an object to-- had a “seize doing business” object because the Union did not, as the Court saw the case, ask for a total cessation of business.","start":156.182,"stop":180.011,"duration":23.83},{"text":"Now, the underlying facts on at issue, the instant labor dispute arose at a construction site in Oyster Creek, New Jersey where a Burns & Roe, Inc., a general contractor, was building a $68-Billion nuclear power plant for the Jersey Central Power and Light Company.","start":180.011,"stop":200.99,"duration":20.98},{"text":"Burns & Roe, the general contractor in charge of this project, had no employees of its own.","start":200.99,"stop":207.243,"duration":6.25},{"text":"It delegated all the-- no construction workers.","start":207.243,"stop":210.787,"duration":3.54},{"text":"It delegated all the construction work to three subcontractors, the White Construction Company, the Chicago Bridge, and-- Iron Company, and the Poirier & McLane Corporation.","start":210.787,"stop":224.805,"duration":14.02},{"text":"Now, all these three subcontractors had, among their employees, members of the Local 825 Operating Engineers Union.","start":224.805,"stop":234.567,"duration":9.76},{"text":"Local 825 had contracts with two of the subcontractors, Chicago Bridge and Poirier.","start":234.567,"stop":240.543,"duration":5.98},{"text":"It had no collective bargaining agreement with either Burns, the general contractor, or with the White construction company.","start":240.543,"stop":248.236,"duration":7.69},{"text":"Now, White’s job, one of the three subcontractors, its job under its subcontractor was to build this nuclear power plant, to create the reactor building for the nuclear power plant, and White’s equipment included, among other things, a piece of equipment known as an electrical welding machine.","start":248.236,"stop":270.963,"duration":22.73},{"text":"And, as soon as White got the subcontract, he assigned the operation of this electrical welding machine, including-- starting on stopping the machine to employees of his who were members of the Iron Workers Union and Local 825, the Operating Engineers Union, who wanted that work and urged upon White that employees of White who were members of Local 825 of Operating Engineers be given the job of pushing the buttons which started and stopped the welding machine.","start":270.963,"stop":307.796,"duration":36.83},{"text":"Now, Local 825, as I pointed out, didn’t have contracts with White, this subcontractor, or with the general contractor but, in support of its demand, they presented profit agreements to White and to Burns.","start":307.796,"stop":323.198,"duration":15.4},{"text":"As-- in effect, those agreements would commit White, the subcontractor, and the general contractor to give all power equipment including specifically welding machines and give that jurisdiction to the operating engineers.","start":323.198,"stop":342.548,"duration":19.35},{"text":"Now, these agreements would not only have bound the signatory, White, who was doing that work, it also bound subcontractors of the signatory so that Burns & Roe, the general contractor, would have been bound to apply that subcontract to White who was a subcontractor.","start":342.548,"stop":361.739,"duration":19.19},{"text":"Now, neither White nor Burns agreed to sign or yielded to this pressure to sign the agreements.","start":361.739,"stop":370.522,"duration":8.78},{"text":"Now, while this dispute was going on, since all the parties involved had agreed that disputes of this kind, really a jurisdictional dispute, should be submitted to the National Joint Board for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes.","start":370.522,"stop":387.383,"duration":16.86},{"text":"The dispute was submitted around October 6th and, within a couple of weeks, the National Joint Board for the Settlement of-- I think it used to be called the Dunlop Board, settled this dispute and decided in favor of the Iron Workers to whom White had given the work.","start":387.383,"stop":403.278,"duration":15.9},{"text":"But, the Operating Engineers weren’t satisfied.","start":403.278,"stop":405.79,"duration":2.51},{"text":"They didn’t submit.","start":405.79,"stop":407.242,"duration":1.45},{"text":"They refused to comply with that submission, with that determination of the Joint Board and they persisted in their efforts to regain the work.","start":407.242,"stop":416.062,"duration":8.82},{"text":"Now, I’m-- just to telescope the fact just a little bit throughout this whole period before, during, and after the Joint Board submission.","start":416.062,"stop":425.505,"duration":9.44},{"text":"Local 825 engaged in coercive efforts, this is agreed, engaged in coercive efforts by threats of work stoppages and by work stoppages to compel White to change its work assignment.","start":425.505,"stop":442.234,"duration":16.73},{"text":"Now, White, of course, who was doing the work in-- who was the employer who was doing the work in question and Local 825, so long as it observed unlawful efforts including, among other things, Section 8 (b) 4 (d), had a perfect right to try to get this work.","start":442.234,"stop":459.603,"duration":17.37},{"text":"But, the fact is that Local 825 didn’t confine itself to lawful efforts.","start":459.603,"stop":465.786,"duration":6.18},{"text":"Not only did it use coercive pressures against White, the employer directly involved, the primary employer, it also used coercive pressures against the general contractor Burns, against the two other subcontractors Chicago and Poirier as a means to getting White to comply with its demands.","start":465.786,"stop":485.393,"duration":19.61},{"text":"Now, Burns, Chicago, and Poirier had nothing to do with the assignment of White’s work.","start":485.393,"stop":494.325,"duration":8.93},{"text":"White was the only, and they had no authority with respect to the assignment of White’s employees.","start":494.325,"stop":500.487,"duration":6.16},{"text":"Now, on this state of the record, the Board found and the Court below agreed that this was a violation of Section 8 (b) 4 (d) of the Act which is a jurisdictional disputes provision, but the Board further found that insofar as the Union exerted coercive pressures on Burns, Chicago, and Poirier who were neutrals in this dispute over-- because of the workers on dispute, the Union also violated Section 8 (b) 4 (b) of the Act since an additional object of the Union’s pressure against the neutrals was to cause a disruption of business among the various employers at the job site.","start":500.487,"stop":548.63,"duration":48.14},{"text":"In the Board’s view, such an object, in the Board’s language, although something less than a total cancellation of business constitutes a “seize doing business” object within the meaning of Section 8 (b) 4 (b).","start":548.63,"stop":567.5,"duration":18.87},{"text":"Now, there’s no quarrel here about the jurisdictional dispute finding that’s not in-- challenged, but very much an issue is the propriety of the Board’s Section 8 (b) 4 (b) finding.","start":567.5,"stop":579.607,"duration":12.11}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What form do the Union activities take against the other two contractors?","start":579.607,"stop":583.994,"duration":4.39}]},{"speakerName":"Arnold Ordman","textObjs":[{"text":"There were-- for one thing, they asked White, the-- Burns, rather, the general contractor, to sign a contract which would’ve bund the general contractor and his subcontractors to give this work to Operating Engineers.","start":583.994,"stop":601.039,"duration":17.04},{"text":"They told him that unless he signed the contract there would be a work stoppage.","start":601.039,"stop":604.345,"duration":3.31},{"text":"There was a work stoppage.","start":604.345,"stop":606.236,"duration":1.89},{"text":"They told the other subcontractors unless Operating Engineers got the work, there would be work stoppages, and there were work stoppages.","start":606.236,"stop":615.425,"duration":9.19},{"text":"And, as a result of which, Operating Engineers employed by the other two subs went off the job.","start":615.425,"stop":622.135,"duration":6.71},{"text":"These were the pressures.","start":622.135,"stop":623.433,"duration":1.3},{"text":"Incidentally, the Court below agrees that these kind of pressures, the threats of work stoppages and work stoppages fell within the statutory disagreement-- fell within the statutory definition.","start":623.433,"stop":634.051,"duration":10.62},{"text":"That finding isn’t challenged her by any party.","start":634.051,"stop":637.796,"duration":3.75},{"text":"Now, the Court below, like the trial examiner in the Board proceeding, gave the statutory words “to seize doing business” a literal reading, in our view, an overly literal reading.","start":637.796,"stop":653.341,"duration":15.54},{"text":"An object of seizing doing business, to the Court below, meant a total and complete cessation of business and intent to cause a disruption or successive disruptions as here, in the Court’s view, was not enough.","start":653.341,"stop":670.71,"duration":17.37},{"text":"According to-- the Court below held that the statutory criterion for the finding of a violation, namely the object test, was not met.","start":670.71,"stop":680.779,"duration":10.07},{"text":"This was not, the Court below thought, the kind of classical boycott, secondary boycott, which Congress was after.","start":680.779,"stop":690.697,"duration":9.92},{"text":"Now, our position is the Court below erred.","start":690.697,"stop":694.61,"duration":3.91},{"text":"I suppose much could be made of the fact, if Your Honors please, $68-million project was repeatedly interrupted by a fight as to who is to push a button on an electrical welding machine, but I don’t want to make light of it.","start":694.61,"stop":711.932,"duration":17.32},{"text":"This case, like the National Woodwork, like others this Court has before it reflects the deep and really the understandable concern of Unions who are trying to preserve their job opportunities and their job security in the face of automation and increasing technology.","start":711.932,"stop":731.367,"duration":19.43},{"text":"This Court has talked about it often and lucidly in the National Woodwork case among others.","start":731.367,"stop":738.378,"duration":7.01},{"text":"Insofar as the Union sought to preserve its work opportunity for the employees it represented and insofar as it used lawful efforts, it was entitled to protection.","start":738.378,"stop":750.149,"duration":11.77},{"text":"Our position here, however, is that the Union went beyond lawful grounds.","start":750.149,"stop":757.02,"duration":6.87},{"text":"We submit that even if the Court below was right and that the only possible reading of “seize doing business” is a total cessation of business, we believe the Court erred on this regard on the side of literalism and we think a few basic postulates established by this Court confirm our position.","start":757.02,"stop":780.676,"duration":23.66},{"text":"Now, first, the basic thrust of the so-called secondary boycott provision, that’s 8 (b) 4 (b), formally 8 (b) 4 (a), is that it is designed to protect unoffending employers from involvement pressures in controversies not their own.","start":780.676,"stop":804.345,"duration":23.67},{"text":"That was the Congressional intent.","start":804.345,"stop":806.69,"duration":2.35},{"text":"It’s documented in the legislative history, and this Court has unim-- una-- uniformly confirmed that in its own decisions as far back as Denver Building in 341 US and at least as recently as National Woodwork in 386 US.","start":806.69,"stop":824.884,"duration":18.19},{"text":"No one in this case, no one even suggests that Burns, the general contractor, and Chicago Bridge, and Poirier were anything other than neutrals in the dispute between White and Local 825.","start":824.884,"stop":842.129,"duration":17.25},{"text":"No one but White could assign the work that was in question.","start":842.129,"stop":846.257,"duration":4.13},{"text":"White was the primary employer, and the purpose and effect of the Union’s pressures on the other three companies was to involve them in a dispute which was no part of their-- not their own, no part of their problem.","start":846.257,"stop":863.65,"duration":17.39},{"text":"Now, the second proposition, a literal reading of Section 8 (b) 4 (b) like its companion provision Section 8 (e) is, in our view and we believe you have so have, a literal reading of those sections is an inadequate basis for determining the statutory reach.","start":863.65,"stop":885.944,"duration":22.29},{"text":"It would be an imposition on your time, if Your Honors please, and my time is also limited, to labor the point that the statutory provisions in Section 8 (b) 4 (b) and Section 8 (e) were the product of Congressional conflict and Congressional compromise, and that this conflict and compromise are reflected in statutory language which, in fact to understate the matter, is somewhat lacking in precision.","start":885.944,"stop":918.512,"duration":32.57},{"text":"I think it was this lack of language precision which prompted, I think, Mr. Justice Harlan to make the comment in National Woodwork which was a split opinion and, Mr. Justice Harlan, you commented that both sides of today’s division in the Court agreed that, in pursuing the search for the true intent of Congress, we should not stop with the language of the statute itself and must look beneath its surface to the legislative history.","start":918.512,"stop":955.93,"duration":37.42},{"text":"We submit the Court below rested on the naked language of the statute and failed to carry out the mandate.","start":955.93,"stop":962.579,"duration":6.65},{"text":"Now, third, a proscribed object such as the statute says that one of them is seize doing business, need not be the only or even the predominant object to bring conduct within the ban of Section 8 (b) 4 (b).","start":962.579,"stop":980.621,"duration":18.04},{"text":"The Court below made much of the fact that, after all, the real goal of the Union here in all its activities against all the employers was not to bring about a permanent cessation of business.","start":980.621,"stop":991.657,"duration":11.04},{"text":"What they wanted was the work that White wasn’t giving to them, and that the real object, the real goal was to get the neutrals, the secondaries to pressure the primary into hiring Operating Engineers.","start":991.657,"stop":1005.941,"duration":14.28},{"text":"That was the burden of the opinion of the Court below, and we concede it.","start":1005.941,"stop":1011.327,"duration":5.39},{"text":"The Board so found, and the finding was the crux of a Section 8 (b) 4 (b) holding, but Denver Building again was the first of a long line of cases establishing that it is efficient, as the Board here found, if a cessation of business was an additional object, an object of the Union’s conduct.","start":1011.327,"stop":1037.38,"duration":26.05},{"text":"And this Court, again, pointed out in these two cases that come to mind immediately, that Congress deliberately substituted the words “an object,” for the original bill which was condemned when you did-- when you exerted coercive pressures for a purpose.","start":1037.38,"stop":1057.858,"duration":20.48},{"text":"They thought that was too limited and substituted the words “an object” and, plainly, an “object of the Union’s conduct” here was to bring out about the kind of disruptions of business, the kind of work stoppages, such work stoppages as would be appropriate or necessary to achieve its goal either of obtaining that work from White or conceivably from a more compliant subcontractor.","start":1057.858,"stop":1084.972,"duration":27.11}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you think the Board’s view on whether or not this does or does not come under

area.","start":1099.785,"stop":1105.352,"duration":5.57},{"text":"As this Court is aware, we’ve been before this Court any number of times in this area and I think the Board’s expertise is entitled to
