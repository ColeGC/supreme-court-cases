metropolitan Mobile although facts just furnished to us by respondents and set forth in a supplemental brief filed Saturday indicates the junior high schools and the high schools there in which a substantial degree of integration was supposed to have been accomplished are in very substantial measure identifiably black.","start":142.821,"stop":172.621,"duration":29.8},{"text":"The question presented to this Court is whether in this school system, where the entire spectrum of school assignment techniques have been used in the past to maintain racial segregation, noncontiguous zoning,

construction.","start":172.621,"stop":200.116,"duration":27.5},{"text":"Whether those techniques, which have been employed in the service of segregation now ought to be used in the service of

segregation.","start":284.37,"stop":299.714,"duration":15.34},{"text":"These assignment techniques were normal, neutral, administrative means of implementing a governmental policy, in this case an unconstitutional governmental policy.","start":299.714,"stop":311.385,"duration":11.67},{"text":"Similarly, transportation and the various other aids of school assignment in the service of integration

area.","start":522.658,"stop":538.163,"duration":15.5},{"text":"The school is closed and now they go to school over there.","start":538.163,"stop":545.377,"duration":7.21},{"text":"There are in fact some small percentage of white students living in some of the 90% to more black districts, but under the plan, as it is operated, as the respondents have informed the District Court for reasons that we do not know, not all of them and perhaps none of them are attending the schools to which they are assigned.","start":545.377,"stop":563.716,"duration":18.34},{"text":"There is a motion pending in the District Court about that but we have not been able to get a hearing.","start":563.716,"stop":569.343,"duration":5.63},{"text":"Moreover, the petition which we took to this Court involves only elementary schools.","start":569.343,"stop":573.854,"duration":4.51},{"text":"The high school situation, however, under actual enrollment figures now furnished seems far worse than projected in the

going to high school and junior high school in all black schools.","start":584.757,"stop":593.824,"duration":9.07},{"text":"Therefore, we have a situation in which the preponderant number of black students in metropolitan Mobile will be spending half of their education, the elementary years in all black schools and the so called palliative of integrated junior high and high school education which does not, in any event cure denial of constitutional rights for the first six years, will in fact not exist for them.","start":593.824,"stop":618.739,"duration":24.92},{"text":"And the issue is,

been expounded in Green and Alexander as requiring the ending of the last vestiges of segregation and the elimination of segregation, root and

satisfied.","start":640.874,"stop":647.946,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Now the justification offered by respondent and the United States for leaving racial segregation essentially intact in metropolitan Mobile is that the result is required by neighborhood schools.","start":647.946,"stop":661.165,"duration":13.22},{"text":"In assessing the so-called neighborhood school zoning of Mobile, we might however first describe the methods of school zoning which Mobile has used traditionally.","start":661.165,"stop":671.801,"duration":10.64},{"text":"On this record, the school district buses more than 20,000 students at an average round trip of 30 miles a day.","start":671.801,"stop":680.388,"duration":8.59},{"text":"Most of the busing is in the rural area, but there is a substantial amount at shorter distances in the city and so busing is hardly foreign to Mobile education and this figure compares fairly well with the fact that 40% of all American school children are bused to school.","start":680.388,"stop":696.412,"duration":16.02},{"text":"Some of this busing has clearly been for the purpose of maintaining racial segregation.","start":696.412,"stop":701.44,"duration":5.03},{"text":"As for example, when approximately 600 black students were bused from rural Saraland down to around this area to an all black school.","start":701.44,"stop":711.613,"duration":10.17},{"text":"Approximately 7000 students in the western part of Mobile over here, it’s in the metropolitan area, are bused where the school districts are large and the distances are somewhat greater and the preponderant part of the white population lives.","start":711.613,"stop":726.205,"duration":14.59},{"text":"But the point is that busing is common place in Mobile education.","start":726.205,"stop":731.318,"duration":5.11},{"text":"Mobile has in the past regularly used noncontiguous zoning.","start":731.318,"stop":736.336,"duration":5.02},{"text":"I would like to ask the Court to turn to pages 7 (a) that’s in the appendix to our brief and look at the two pages of colored maps there.","start":736.336,"stop":754.29,"duration":17.95},{"text":"These maps were prepared by the United States and have been adopted from their appendix in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.","start":754.29,"stop":763.91,"duration":9.62},{"text":"The zones on the map are colored in a way so that all parts of a noncontiguous zone are the same color and some of these involve so called satellite zoning and some of it involves noncontiguous pairing.","start":763.91,"stop":778.146,"duration":14.24},{"text":"It can be seen at a glance that Mobile has assigned children to schools on anything but a neighborhood basis.","start":778.146,"stop":786.189,"duration":8.04},{"text":"The difference is of course this map depicts a period in which noncontiguous zoning was used to maintain racial segregation.","start":786.189,"stop":793.025,"duration":6.84},{"text":"On the first page, for example, the bright pink portions constitute a single school zone in which black children were bused in the northern part of the zone to the pink semi-circular sections in the right side which is the Saraland situation I was describing a moment ago.","start":793.025,"stop":809.455,"duration":16.43},{"text":"White children attended a single school from the blue portion of the map, that being satellite zoning.","start":809.455,"stop":815.747,"duration":6.29},{"text":"There was a school in one part, but not in the other.","start":815.747,"stop":818.643,"duration":2.9},{"text":"But the corridor

the bright red portions of the map, again just taking an example, constitute a white school zone and white children at Brookley went up to the white school at
