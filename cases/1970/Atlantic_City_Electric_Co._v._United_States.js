McCarthy","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.","start":55.895,"stop":61.503,"duration":5.61},{"text":"The issue in this case is the reviewability of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission which authorizes the nation's railroads to raise their freight rates an average of 5% or nearly a half billion dollars a year.","start":61.503,"stop":86.899,"duration":25.4},{"text":"I think it's important to have in mind just how this case arose.","start":86.899,"stop":94.367,"duration":7.47},{"text":"The usual procedure followed by a railroad when it wishes to change a rate is to file the new rate with the commission, 30 days before its effective date.","start":94.367,"stop":110.668,"duration":16.3},{"text":"During that 30 day period, the rate is subject to protest and to suspension and investigation.","start":110.668,"stop":124.013,"duration":13.35},{"text":"If the commission determines not to suspend or investigate, the rate goes into effect, the commission's action is discretionary, not reviewable and one who wishes to complain of the rate must file a formal complaint.","start":124.013,"stop":143.497,"duration":19.48},{"text":"On the other hand, if the commission decides to investigate the final order in the investigation proceeding is subject to judicial review.","start":143.497,"stop":160.549,"duration":17.05},{"text":"In a general increase case, the procedures that must be followed are a little different.","start":160.549,"stop":168.781,"duration":8.23},{"text":"There are three reasons for this.","start":168.781,"stop":171.824,"duration":3.04},{"text":"There are outstanding orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission which prescribe rates.","start":171.824,"stop":179.279,"duration":7.45},{"text":"Those rates can't be changed without commission authorization.","start":179.279,"stop":185.574,"duration":6.3},{"text":"Then in every general increase, situations arise in which there is a lesser rate for a longer distance that applies for a shorter distance included within the longer, and that of course is a violation of Section 4 of the Act, unless the commission authorizes.","start":185.574,"stop":216.652,"duration":31.08},{"text":"Finally there's the mechanical problem.","start":216.652,"stop":220.987,"duration":4.34},{"text":"It's just not feasible to file increases in all the myriad railroad rates.","start":220.987,"stop":230.03,"duration":9.04},{"text":"In a preferred procedure is to file a master tariff which includes all the increases and what are known as connecting link supplements.","start":230.03,"stop":243.478,"duration":13.45},{"text":"These are supplements in each individual tariff which simply say that all of the rates in this tariff are subject to the increases in master tariff.","start":243.478,"stop":257.851,"duration":14.37},{"text":"The commission's tariff filing rules don't permit that so in order to follow that procedure, it's necessary to get authority to depart from those rules.","start":257.851,"stop":271.798,"duration":13.95},{"text":"The proceeding of which we seek review was initiated by the railroads by filing a petition asking for all three of these forms of relief.","start":271.798,"stop":288.825,"duration":17.03},{"text":"The commission immediately granted the tariff filing authority requested and it modified outstanding orders and granted fourth section relief, only to the extent necessary to permit the tariffs to be filed.","start":288.825,"stop":314.699,"duration":25.87},{"text":"At this point, the situation is similar to what it would have been had no such authority been required.","start":314.699,"stop":325.982,"duration":11.28},{"text":"The rates are filed, they're subject to protest; they're subject to investigation and suspension.","start":325.982,"stop":334.442,"duration":8.46},{"text":"There is one major difference though.","start":334.442,"stop":339.039,"duration":4.6},{"text":"That is that the railroad -- that the commission could not at this point, simply say we won't investigate and that the rates going to affect because the commission has -- or the railroads have an obligation to get a modification of outstanding orders and fourth section relief before they can legally put these rates into effect.","start":339.039,"stop":366.089,"duration":27.05},{"text":"And that's recognized by the railroads in their petition.","start":366.089,"stop":371.027,"duration":4.94},{"text":"They ask that the rates be authorized only after hearing and after a finding at the general level will not be more and is just unreasonable.","start":371.027,"stop":384.845,"duration":13.82},{"text":"The rates were protested.","start":384.845,"stop":387.885,"duration":3.04},{"text":"The commission did suspend and the commission did initiate an investigation.","start":387.885,"stop":396.417,"duration":8.53},{"text":"At the same time, it authorized the railroads to put into effect a 3% increase subject to investigation.","start":396.417,"stop":408.419,"duration":12},{"text":"That 3% increase isn't involved here.","start":408.419,"stop":410.468,"duration":2.05},{"text":"I mentioned that just in the interest of completeness.","start":410.468,"stop":415.382,"duration":4.91},{"text":"The subsequent investigation was extensive.","start":415.382,"stop":419.865,"duration":4.48},{"text":"The commission divided the case into 10 sub proceedings to one, it assigned the question of revenue needs to the other 9, it assigned various commodities and services.","start":419.865,"stop":439.342,"duration":19.48},{"text":"At the end of the revenue -- end of the hearing in the revenue sub proceeding, the commission ended its order of November 25th in which it authorized the railroads to put in all of the increases they had proposed with some minor exceptions subject to possible change as a result of the final outcome of the other 9 sub proceedings.","start":439.342,"stop":472.263,"duration":32.92},{"text":"At the conclusion of all the hearings, the commission ended its order of January 9.","start":472.263,"stop":481.892,"duration":9.63},{"text":"That order authorizes the railroads to put the increases in effect.","start":481.892,"stop":489.604,"duration":7.71},{"text":"It orders them to cease and desist from charging any higher increases.","start":489.604,"stop":496.647,"duration":7.04},{"text":"It finds that the rates will not exceed a just and reasonable maximum on a general basis.","start":496.647,"stop":507.556,"duration":10.91},{"text":"It modifies all outstanding orders of the commission and grants fourth section relief to the extent necessary to make these increases lawful.","start":507.556,"stop":523.174,"duration":15.62},{"text":"And finally the order says the proceeding is discontinued.","start":523.174,"stop":530.009,"duration":6.84},{"text":"In other words, this is the last step in this general increase case.","start":530.009,"stop":539.201,"duration":9.19},{"text":"The plaintiffs in number 106 are shippers or associations of shippers who pay more than 20% of the nation's freight bill.","start":539.201,"stop":555.812,"duration":16.61},{"text":"And the action was filed as a class action in behalf of all shippers.","start":555.812,"stop":565.965,"duration":10.15},{"text":"In every general increase case, I don't care whether it's a railroad or what kind of utility it is.","start":565.965,"stop":574.923,"duration":8.96},{"text":"There are two basic questions.","start":574.923,"stop":578.901,"duration":3.98},{"text":"One, what increase if any should be authorized?","start":578.901,"stop":586.439,"duration":7.54},{"text":"How much more money should be provided by an increase in rates?","start":586.439,"stop":591.641,"duration":5.2},{"text":"And the second question is, how are we going to spread that increase out over the various services that this utility performs.","start":591.641,"stop":605.75,"duration":14.11},{"text":"Our complaint goes to the first issue.","start":605.75,"stop":611.391,"duration":5.64},{"text":"We say that the commission did not apply the rate making standards in the Interstate Commerce Act and that if it had applied them, it could not have authorized this increase on the present record.","start":611.391,"stop":632.869,"duration":21.48},{"text":"We also say that the commission should have looked at the needs of the railroads in each of the main regions of the country, rather than just a general overall increase, and we say that the commission should have looked at types of traffic by broad categories.","start":632.869,"stop":658.902,"duration":26.03},{"text":"We do not say that the increase makes any specific rate unreasonable.","start":658.902,"stop":670.911,"duration":12.01},{"text":"The controlling principle as we see it, is that there is a presumption in favor of the reviewability of an agency order.","start":670.911,"stop":688.16,"duration":17.25},{"text":"This Court has repeatedly said that an order will not be held to be non-reviewable, unless there is persuasive reason to believe that Congress so intended.","start":688.16,"stop":703.082,"duration":14.92},{"text":"The railroads point to nothing even remotely suggesting that Congress intended to accept general increase orders from the broad statutory authorization that it has given the review orders of Interstate Commerce Commission and to review rate orders generally in the Administrative Procedure Act.","start":703.082,"stop":731.962,"duration":28.88},{"text":"The railroads basically make two arguments.","start":731.962,"stop":736.458,"duration":4.5},{"text":"They say we haven't exhausted our administrative remedy.","start":736.458,"stop":740.105,"duration":3.65}]},{"speakerName":"William O.

Douglas","textObjs":[{"text":"Why is it that is being administrative creature, it's not very significant as to whether or not the statute has a review per se.","start":788.907,"stop":805.111,"duration":16.2}]},{"speakerName":"Charles J. McCarthy","textObjs":[{"text":"Well Your Honor, this is a proceeding which follows the Interstate Commerce Act.","start":805.111,"stop":813.543,"duration":8.43},{"text":"The commission is proceeding under the authority granted by Section 157 of the Act.","start":813.543,"stop":820.692,"duration":7.15},{"text":"So the particular way that the commission proceeds in this case is a matter of administrative decision perhaps.","start":820.692,"stop":830.866,"duration":10.17},{"text":"But the authority to proceed and the basic procedure is all pursuant to Section 157 of the Interstate Commerce Act.","start":830.866,"stop":840.519,"duration":9.65}]},{"speakerName":"William O. Douglas","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you have specific review provisions in those sections?","start":840.519,"stop":845.04,"duration":4.52}]},{"speakerName":"Charles J. McCarthy","textObjs":[{"text":"There is a specific review provision Section 1336 of Title 28 which says that all others in the Interstate Commerce Commission are subject to review in the Courts.","start":845.04,"stop":864.003,"duration":18.96},{"text":"Court please, I think of the general level of freight rates as being a horizontal line and the individual rates are dots.","start":864.003,"stop":878.178,"duration":14.17},{"text":"Some of them are above that line and some of them are below.","start":878.178,"stop":885.165,"duration":6.99},{"text":"And the average height of all those dots is the same height as that horizontal line.","start":885.165,"stop":894.055,"duration":8.89},{"text":"Now suppose, we raise that line 5%, if all of the rates are raised proportionately, the relationship of each rate to that new line is the same as its relationship to the old line was.","start":894.055,"stop":917.098,"duration":23.04},{"text":"The railroads say we need to go back to the commission before we can have review of the order raising that horizontal line and file complaints on the million or so rates in which we are interested.","start":917.098,"stop":934.415,"duration":17.32},{"text":"What would the issue be in such a proceeding, when the lawfulness of an individual rate is challenged, the question is, how it is related to the general level of reasonableness.","start":934.415,"stop":950.644,"duration":16.23},{"text":"It doesn't involve the question of where the general level of reasonableness is.","start":950.644,"stop":958.396,"duration":7.75},{"text":"Now we are not challenging the relationship of individual rates to that general level.","start":958.396,"stop":966.111,"duration":7.72},{"text":"So if we followed the railroad suggestion and went back to the commission where these thousands or millions of cases, we would have to say to the commission, we do not challenge the relationship of any of these rates to the new level that you have set, all we want to challenge is what is that level which you have just set in a proceeding that has just been terminated.","start":966.111,"stop":1002.98,"duration":36.87},{"text":"Now, that is the administrative procedure that the railroads say “we haven't exhausted it.”","start":1002.98,"stop":1016.015,"duration":13.03},{"text":"What the railroads are really saying is that shippers have no interest in the general level of freight rates, no legal interest.","start":1016.015,"stop":1025.94,"duration":9.93},{"text":"They certainly have a tremendous practical interest.","start":1025.94,"stop":1031.261,"duration":5.32},{"text":"It's more important to a shipper to have his rates raised 5% across the board than it is to have one individual rate raised or to have one individual rate that he thinks is a little bit too high and wouldn't it be a little anomalous to say that he can have Court review where his interests are affected to a minor degree and can't have Court review, if his interests are affected to a major degree.","start":1031.261,"stop":1068.651,"duration":37.39},{"text":"Now that brings me to the policy question, the railroads argue that this Court should deny relief because some District Court might improvidently grant interlocutory relief to a shipper, to the railroads detriment.","start":1068.651,"stop":1095.63,"duration":26.98},{"text":"From my experience, I think that danger is greatly exaggerated but I suppose it is possible that the District Court might act improvidently.","start":1095.63,"stop":1110.093,"duration":14.46},{"text":"But there are two answers to that.","start":1110.093,"stop":1113.287,"duration":3.19},{"text":"In the first place, if the safeguards that attach to interlocutory relief are not sufficient in a general increase case, then the thing to do is to shore up those safeguards.","start":1113.287,"stop":1134.945,"duration":21.66},{"text":"It's not to deny judicial review.","start":1134.945,"stop":1139.708,"duration":4.76},{"text":"You don't throw out the baby with the bath water.","start":1139.708,"stop":1145.056,"duration":5.35},{"text":"In a second place when Congress authorized review of the Interstate Commerce Commission orders, it knew then interlocutory relief would be granted in cases which the Courts think are appropriate.","start":1145.056,"stop":1165.842,"duration":20.79},{"text":"If the safeguards and interlocutory relief are not sufficient, the railroads ought to be talking to the Congress and not to this Court.","start":1165.842,"stop":1183.614,"duration":17.77},{"text":"And while we‘re on the field of public policy, I would just like to remind the Court that there are two sides to every coin.","start":1183.614,"stop":1194.772,"duration":11.16},{"text":"And we think that the policy reasons for judicial review vastly out weigh any on the other side.","start":1194.772,"stop":1204.229,"duration":9.46},{"text":"If an agency is insulated from judicial review, there is always the risk that there are handling of cases of this kind may become

November.","start":4441.307,"stop":4467.632,"duration":26.32},{"text":"At the same time again saying to these carriers and a way it did that again was to say “you can file another tariff” which the

reviewable.","start":4517.133,"stop":4559.55,"duration":42.42},{"text":"Because we believe that was the only consequence of what this commission did
