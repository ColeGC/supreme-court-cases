Dempsey, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, the hope of the Congress I take it was that during this 2-year period, as some of the courts have indicated who have reviewed this matter, that a new plateau of work rules and manning regulations would be achieved to collect the bargain.","start":213.704,"stop":230.19,"duration":16.49},{"text":"And the alternative of course was to make the solution a permanent one and the Congress group Act from that and the hope that the parties would workout their own differences during this period, but unhappily that hope has not matured.","start":230.19,"stop":243.843,"duration":13.65},{"text":"And what happened then of the expiration of the awards was that the Union in pursuit of these Section 6 notices insisted upon carrier by carrier negotiation which put them in the position to call whipsaw strikes against individual railroads and the consequence of all that was a series of strikes and threats of strikes in 1968 and 1969 and the consequence of that was the surrender by most of the nation's railroads of practically all the benefits that they had secured under this arbitration awards.","start":243.843,"stop":274.445,"duration":30.6},{"text":"The Union got to the Northwestern rather late in this series of mediations but in any case conferences were had, mediation was held and the Board terminated its jurisdiction over the case in October of 1969, October 16th by the way, so that the 30-day cooling off period ran on November 16th of 1969.","start":274.445,"stop":298.719,"duration":24.27},{"text":"And three days later the Northwestern brought this suit alleging that though conferences had been had and mediation had been held, that they were not the sort of conferences and it was not the sort of mediation contemplated by the Act because the Union which was charged had not fulfilled its obligations in terms of bargaining that were imposed upon it by Section 2 First.","start":298.719,"stop":323.436,"duration":24.72},{"text":"The District Court granted a restraining order.","start":323.436,"stop":325.551,"duration":2.12},{"text":"A hearing was had on the most of the preliminary injunction, but at the conclusion of the Northwestern’s evidence, the District Court

Board.","start":325.551,"stop":345.505,"duration":19.95},{"text":"The District Court did grant an injunction pending appeal.","start":345.505,"stop":348.475,"duration":2.97},{"text":"After an expedited appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed on the same rationale, but recognizing that its decision was contrary to a decision of the Fourth Circuit in the Piedmont Aviation case, the Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending the outcome of these proceedings before this Court.","start":348.475,"stop":365.671,"duration":17.2},{"text":"Here, the respondent urges the adoption of the rationale of the lower courts that is that Section 2 First does not impose judicially enforceable obligations.","start":365.671,"stop":378.832,"duration":13.16},{"text":"The AFL amicus curiae on the other hand, suggests that even if 2 First is judicially enforceable that the mode of enforcement should not include strike injunctions because of the prohibitions of Norris-LaGuardia.","start":378.832,"stop":394.073,"duration":15.24},{"text":"I want of course to touch upon both strands of these arguments but before I do that, I should like to indicate to the Court the range of different kinds of problems that have been dealt with by the courts under Section 2 First, because it is our view that if the decision of the lower court is affirmed there will be a very dislocating effect with respect to a substantial and important body of case law that has been built up on the premise of Section 2 First is enforceable.","start":394.073,"stop":426.323,"duration":32.25},{"text":"Of course, one kind of case is the one that was alleged in the Court below in here that I won’t go to the evidence because the lower courts never reached it.","start":426.323,"stop":435.059,"duration":8.74},{"text":"But the character of the allegations go to what has been called subjective bad faith bargaining, at least, many of the allegations go to that so that this is the kind of the case in which it's charged that the Union came to the bargaining table with a predetermined position and a determination not to deviate from that position no matter what relevant considerations might be advanced for the carrier.","start":435.059,"stop":462.985,"duration":27.93},{"text":"It was in the terms of art that are sometimes used in this area, a surface bargaining, take it or leave it bargaining and the only option given to the carrier was to concede or to take a strike.","start":462.985,"stop":478.361,"duration":15.38},{"text":"Now, I should like to indicate that 2 First is a two-way street with respect to this kind of charge as the pending litigation brought by the United States against the Florida East Coast Railway indicates.","start":478.361,"stop":489.761,"duration":11.4},{"text":"We’ve described that litigation in our supplemental reply brief, but there the Government joined by the Unions is asserting that the railroad of Florida East Coast should not be permitted to put into effect its sweeping Section 6 proposals notwithstanding the fact that it has exhausted all of the formal procedures of the Act on the ground as the Government charges that the railroad has not complied with its bargaining obligations under Section 2 First.","start":489.761,"stop":518.653,"duration":28.89},{"text":"Now, there’s another kind of a problem that the courts have dealt with under 2 First and that has to do with the bargaining authority of the collective bargaining representatives.","start":518.653,"stop":528.335,"duration":9.68},{"text":"In the case at bar for example, the evidence showed that the Union representatives refused even to discuss a compromise proposal by the railroad that would have involved the payment of very substantial additional compensation to the existing employees, something in the way of an extra thousand dollars a year.","start":528.335,"stop":548.169,"duration":19.83},{"text":"And it showed also that the reason, of course this is only carrier’s evidence, the Union hasn't had a chance to put a case in, but by the carrier’s evidence, it showed that the reason that the agents, the collective bargaining representatives refused even to discuss this proposal is because a convention resolution tied their hands and this kind of a restriction upon the authority of bargaining representatives has been held by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Piedmont Aviation to contravene Section 2 First.","start":548.169,"stop":580.332,"duration":32.16},{"text":"In addition, the enforceability of moratorium clauses has been dealt with in the lower courts under Section 2 First.","start":580.332,"stop":588.184,"duration":7.85},{"text":"Moratorium clauses are coming into more widespread use in this industry.","start":588.184,"stop":592.173,"duration":3.99},{"text":"The
