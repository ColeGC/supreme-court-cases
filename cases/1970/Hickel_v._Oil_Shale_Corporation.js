respondent’s numerous contentions, only one is properly here that Virginia-Colorado held that the administrative cancellations of the 1930’s were alter various of the Secretary’s authority and hence that their claims survive these proceedings unimpaired.","start":412.608,"stop":428.795,"duration":16.19},{"text":"The District Court and Court of Appeals agreed with that contention, it was the only

work with abandonment of the claims.","start":616.975,"stop":637.583,"duration":20.61},{"text":"To this extent, the remark which appears in the Virginia-Colorado decision, that failure to do assessment work gives the Government no ground of forfeiture on abandonment grounds as plainly incorrect.","start":637.583,"stop":650.821,"duration":13.24},{"text":"It may have been correct in that case where 15 months after there was a failure to do assessment work the claimants came forward and said, “we’re going to start right up again” but it certainly was not correct as a statement of general law.","start":650.821,"stop":666.533,"duration":15.71},{"text":"Now it is true that in general, the maintenance requirements were privately enforced.","start":666.533,"stop":672.3,"duration":5.77},{"text":"That was because in general, the United States had no need for this land but there are cases in which the Government does want its land.","start":672.3,"stop":681.215,"duration":8.92},{"text":"It may want to create a national park or an irrigation project.","start":681.215,"stop":686.504,"duration":5.29},{"text":"And in cases like that, there was an established body of law set out in our brief beginning at page 52 to the effect that the Secretary could withdraw the land from further location and in that circumstance, the

years since.","start":720.432,"stop":741.885,"duration":21.45},{"text":"As I say the Secretary did rule in a small but consistent body of law that in these situations where the Government had a
