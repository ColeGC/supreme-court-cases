hearing.","start":29.763,"stop":34.676,"duration":4.91},{"text":"It’s an appeal from a decision of a three-judge court to the southern district of New York.","start":34.676,"stop":40.409,"duration":5.73},{"text":"The suit in this case was an affirmative suit brought by three law students, three applicants to the Bar of the state of New York and three organizations, including a Law Students Civil Rights Research Council, challenging the constitutionality of certain statutes and statewide judicial rules governing the admission to the New York Bar.","start":40.409,"stop":61.45,"duration":21.04},{"text":"In addition, the complaint made similar allegations concerning the implementation of the statutes and rules through questionnaires, affidavits, interviews and other practices I shall describe shortly.","start":61.45,"stop":74.101,"duration":12.65},{"text":"A majority of the three-judge court below, Judges Friendly and Bonsal granted the appellants partial relief, but upheld its challenge statutes and statewide judicial rules.","start":74.101,"stop":86.628,"duration":12.53},{"text":"Judge Constance Motley, in an extensive dissenting opinion, took the view that the principle portions of the majority opinion were erroneous and she would have broadly declare unconstitutional one New York statute on its face, and the other as applied.","start":86.628,"stop":102.541,"duration":15.91},{"text":"It’s important for an understanding of this case to perceive the type of personal and political screening program that takes place in the State of New York.","start":102.541,"stop":112.324,"duration":9.78},{"text":"The statutes and judicial rules that are relevant are set out in the appendix to the brief for appellants, starting on page 1a.","start":112.324,"stop":121.763,"duration":9.44},{"text":"Section 90 of the New York judiciary law provides, “the admission to and removal from the practice by the appellate division takes place when the appellate division and the State Board of Law Examiners are satisfied that each person who passes the bar exam, possess the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor at law.”","start":121.763,"stop":146.907,"duration":25.14},{"text":"Rule 81, immediately underneath Section 90 on page 3a of the appendix provides, this is an implementing rule that has the effect of a statute, “that each applicant to the bar must produce before a committee a character and fitness evidence that he possess the good moral character and general fitness requisite for an attorney.”","start":146.907,"stop":169.197,"duration":22.29},{"text":"On the facing page, page 2a, is Rule 9406 which provides “that no person shall receive a certificate from any committee, any bar committee and no person shall be admitted to practice as an attorney unless he shall furnish satisfactory proof to the effect among other things that he believes in the form of the Government of the United States and is loyal to such Government” and there are three other requirements including citizenship and residence.","start":169.197,"stop":198.238,"duration":29.04},{"text":"Now, these standards for admissions in the State of New York are implemented by a complex procedural mechanisms that delves deeply into the political and personal lives of each applicant.","start":198.238,"stop":209.242,"duration":11},{"text":"I shall be more specific about this later.","start":209.242,"stop":211.714,"duration":2.47},{"text":"It will suffice to say now that each applicant must answer extended questionnaires that raise questions regarding every aspect of his life.","start":211.714,"stop":222.672,"duration":10.96},{"text":"Secondly, there are so-called home life affidavits which must be submitted to the bar committee by persons who know the applicant personally and have visited in his home.","start":222.672,"stop":232.557,"duration":9.88},{"text":"Third, there are independent investigations that take place, including inquiries of the applicant’s school and draft board, his former employers and to police and other agencies, as well as the general public through publication in the New York law journal.","start":232.557,"stop":246.637,"duration":14.08},{"text":"Finally, after all the information is reviewed by a committee member, a personal interview takes place.","start":246.637,"stop":252.967,"duration":6.33},{"text":"If there is nothing unorthodox about an applicant, the interview will be perfunctory and admission will follow almost automatically.","start":252.967,"stop":260.281,"duration":7.31},{"text":"But if there some unorthodox political activity or associations, there is an intensified investigation, new interviews, new questions and sometimes a delay in admission at personal and professional cost to the applicant.","start":260.281,"stop":273.712,"duration":13.43},{"text":"All these takes place at a low level of visibility, but the effect on the constitutional rights of the applicant is destructive.","start":273.712,"stop":281.368,"duration":7.66},{"text":"First, it involves an unwarranted intrusion broadly into their political and personal privacy and secondly, it inhibits the exercise of First Amendment rights by law students and applicants because of a fear of delay in admission.","start":281.368,"stop":295.341,"duration":13.97},{"text":"All this is destructive to them, it’s also destructive to the national interest as I shall try to --","start":295.341,"stop":301.139,"duration":5.8}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Is this questionnaire used in all

court below unanimously agreed in an opinion by Judge Friendly that certain practices of the bar committees were invalid.","start":316.361,"stop":326.597,"duration":10.24},{"text":"They held question 27(a), which ask applicants, “Do you believe in the principles of the form of the government of the United States to be impermissibly vague and overbroad?”","start":326.597,"stop":339.604,"duration":13.01},{"text":"It held question 26 also invalid.","start":339.604,"stop":343.823,"duration":4.22},{"text":"That question dealt and currently deals with membership in organizations advocating overthrow of the Government by force and violence.","start":343.823,"stop":352.1,"duration":8.28},{"text":"Judge Friendly held that the question is at formally provided was invalid because it did not require knowledge by the applicant of the illegal purposes of the organization and there was no requirement that the illegal activity of the organization be coincident with the membership of the individual.","start":352.1,"stop":368.826,"duration":16.73},{"text":"Finally, Judge Friendly held invalid question 31, which formally inquired whether there was any incident in your life, the life of the applicant, that was called for by the forgoing questions on the questionnaire, which has any favorable or detrimental bearing on your character or fitness and Judge Friendly held that this kind of soul-searching question was too broad and he struck it down.","start":368.826,"stop":394.295,"duration":25.47},{"text":"At the same time, the defendants themselves deleted certain questions from their questionnaire and what Judge Motley termed the tacit confession of error.","start":394.295,"stop":404.472,"duration":10.18},{"text":"These extremely broad questions, which are found on page 183 of the record, dealt broadly with membership in organizations and societies that the applicant may have joined before and during law school and extra curricular activities that he engaged in or may have engaged in while a student, but the majority below upheld the two relevant New York statutes and the implementing questions.","start":404.472,"stop":430.841,"duration":26.37},{"text":"We have many objections, both to the statutes and the questions and the implementing procedures, but they boil down to two principle points.","start":430.841,"stop":439.424,"duration":8.58},{"text":"The first point is that Section 9 -- Rule 9406, which is on 2a of the appendix, and the implementing question, question 27, are invalid because they compel a declaration of belief and are impermissibly vague.","start":439.424,"stop":454.991,"duration":15.57},{"text":"Second, that Section 90 of the judiciary law, the good moral character standard, which incidentally we do not dispute on its face because we accept Judge, Justice Frankfurter’s for this formulation of the good moral character standard as Mr. Boudin stated yesterday from the Schware case.","start":454.991,"stop":472.125,"duration":17.13},{"text":"But we do maintain that Section 90 has been invalidly applied because it’s been used to test the political ideas of the applicants that are protected by the First Amendment, both because of the invalidity of the revised question 26, which is found in page 6a of the appendix and because of the impermissibly broad pattern of investigation into protected activity that the bar committees undertake.","start":472.125,"stop":499.117,"duration":26.99},{"text":"Now, before turning to my first point, I would like very briefly to make four preliminary comments that are central to an understanding of our position.","start":499.117,"stop":508.206,"duration":9.09},{"text":"The first concerns the deterrent effect on a political activity of students.","start":508.206,"stop":513.246,"duration":5.04},{"text":"I have seen this for 10 years at New York University law school.","start":513.246,"stop":516.672,"duration":3.43},{"text":"This is not an imagination, this is not a product of anyone’s imagination, it is not a chimerical allegation.","start":516.672,"stop":524.224,"duration":7.55},{"text":"There are students who are deterred from political activity.","start":524.224,"stop":527.6,"duration":3.38},{"text":"There are professors who tell students not to engage in political activity until they’re members of the Bar.","start":527.6,"stop":533.331,"duration":5.73},{"text":"Some of the most responsible students, some of the best students are deterred from lawful political activity.","start":533.331,"stop":539.614,"duration":6.28},{"text":"Many of these students and the families of these students have gone to great extent to put them through law school, even a delay of a few months in earning a living is relevant to the prospects of their families and their own prospects.","start":539.614,"stop":552.239,"duration":12.63},{"text":"The two cases that are cited in the brief, the cases of Messrs Rosenberg and Kaimowitz are examples of people who have been delayed by the character committee for engaging an undoubted political activity.","start":552.239,"stop":563.633,"duration":11.39},{"text":"Secondly, nothing that is being urged here in any sense is inconsistent with the ability of the bar and the courts to discipline improper conduct of applicants or members of the Bar.","start":563.633,"stop":576.338,"duration":12.7},{"text":"Mr. Boudin has reviewed four different types of sanctions that are available and I shall not repeat them, but I will deal with one other aspect.","start":576.338,"stop":585.207,"duration":8.87},{"text":"Every one of us is concern by violence, everyone of us is concern by disruption in courtrooms.","start":585.207,"stop":591.036,"duration":5.83},{"text":"In my experience, the bar associations of this country are able to respond to this problem in a constitutional manner.","start":591.036,"stop":597.724,"duration":6.69},{"text":"The ABA has setup a special committee under Judge Murray and who’s a member of the District Court in the First Circuit, to set standards for behavior by judges, by lawyers, by spectators and by defendants.","start":597.724,"stop":609.827,"duration":12.1},{"text":"That committee has already issued a preliminary report.","start":609.827,"stop":613.021,"duration":3.19},{"text":"The bar association of the City of New York has setup a special committee with men like Bruce Bromley, Best Webster, George Lindsey and Burk Marshall on the committee to look into the same matter.","start":613.021,"stop":623.607,"duration":10.59},{"text":"I have the privilege of being the Executive Director of that study.","start":623.607,"stop":626.789,"duration":3.18},{"text":"The bar association has not been delinquent.","start":626.789,"stop":629.359,"duration":2.57},{"text":"The bar associations of this country are able to deal with conduct that is impermissible, conduct that deserves the sanction of either the Bar or the Court.","start":629.359,"stop":639.715,"duration":10.36},{"text":"But this is not conduct we’re dealing with here, it’s the delving into protected political activity.","start":639.715,"stop":645.981,"duration":6.27},{"text":"Third, none of the criticisms of the statute, none of the criticisms of the questions, none of the criticisms of the practices that we’re making here are meant in a slightest to impute a good faith, the integrity of the members of the bar committees, the members of the Courts of New York or any other State.","start":645.981,"stop":664.014,"duration":18.03},{"text":"These men are operating under a system that was handed to them.","start":664.014,"stop":667.932,"duration":3.92},{"text":"They are doing their very best to implement that system, but it’s a system that was setup without full consciousness of the First Amendment problems that are raised.","start":667.932,"stop":676.572,"duration":8.64},{"text":"I want to repeat, we’re not criticizing individuals, we’re not suggesting that there’s a certain venality or arbitrariness on the part of particular people or committees.","start":676.572,"stop":685.862,"duration":9.29},{"text":"But the fact of the matter is a structure has been setup that’s improper and it should be dealt with.","start":685.862,"stop":692.457,"duration":6.6}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Does the record show the history of these questions to which you

investigation.","start":712.543,"stop":716.312,"duration":3.77}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"But this -- the record doesn’t show the particularized history of these particular questions?","start":716.312,"stop":721.42,"duration":5.11}]},{"speakerName":"Norman Dorsen","textObjs":[{"text":"It does not.","start":721.42,"stop":722.324,"duration":0.9},{"text":"It does not Mr. Justice.","start":722.324,"stop":723.332,"duration":1.01},{"text":"The final preliminary point I would like to make is there’s no need for this Court to overrule the Konigsberg and estoppel cases to deal with the invalid statutes and practices here.","start":723.332,"stop":734.695,"duration":11.36},{"text":"The question in the Konigsberg was a different kind of question from the question that is being asked of the applicants in New York.","start":734.695,"stop":741.455,"duration":6.76},{"text":"The foundation for the question as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out in both opinions in those cases had been laid and the committee was trying to fill in gaps.","start":741.455,"stop":751.165,"duration":9.71},{"text":"There are no gaps here, there is no foundation here.","start":751.165,"stop":754.505,"duration":3.34},{"text":"We’re dealing here with questions that are being asked of every single applicant to the New York Bar.","start":754.505,"stop":760.69,"duration":6.19},{"text":"The entire generation of lawyers, they are going to have deal with the problems that all of us are dealing with at the present time.","start":760.69,"stop":768.056,"duration":7.37},{"text":"And finally, Konigsberg and estoppel are distinguishable of course, because the governing constitutional principles that have evolve -- have been evolved by this Court have changed in last decade.","start":768.056,"stop":779.643,"duration":11.59},{"text":"It’s exactly decades as the Konigsberg case was argued in this Court.","start":779.643,"stop":785.159,"duration":5.52},{"text":"Now, what I would like to do is deal with the first principle point that I alluded to earlier, namely Rule 9406, which is found at page 2a of the appendix.","start":785.159,"stop":798.126,"duration":12.97},{"text":"And here we have a rule which is of statewide applicability and has the force of the statute that whatever the doubts may have been in the Arizona case that Mr. Justice White raised, this is a belief question.","start":798.126,"stop":811.885,"duration":13.76},{"text":"It is clear that each person who wants to be a member of the Bar must furnish satisfactory proof to the effect that he believes in the form of the Government of the United States and is loyal to that Government.","start":811.885,"stop":825.115,"duration":13.23},{"text":"And there are many expressions by members of this Court.","start":825.115,"stop":827.936,"duration":2.82},{"text":"Mr. Justice Robert’s memorable quote was referred to yesterday by Mr. Justice Black.","start":827.936,"stop":833.11,"duration":5.17},{"text":"Mr. Justice Jackson on another occasion expressed what seems to me the

Court, we have to objection to at all, but this is not that case.","start":852.79,"stop":861.452,"duration":8.66},{"text":"This deals with belief and as Mr. Justice Jackson said, “I know of no

Justice.","start":986.241,"stop":998.739,"duration":12.5},{"text":"Now, the State says that Section 9406 is really like the constitutional oath that Mr. Justice Harlan raised in connection with the

implementation of this section in New York as both the Kaimowitz and the Rosenberg cases which are cited incidentally on page 10 of the brief in opposition to the motion to affirm show that the way
