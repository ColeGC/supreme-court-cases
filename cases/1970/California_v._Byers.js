California and presents the issue of the applicability of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to a state hit and run statute.","start":30.033,"stop":46.26,"duration":16.23},{"text":"In particular, we think the questions presented by this case are one, whether the requirement imposed by a state hit and run statute that a driver involved in an accident must stop at the scene and give his name and address violates the privilege against self-incrimination and two, whether it is necessary to bar use of that information or fruits of that information in any criminal proceeding, in order to sustain the constitutionality of the statute.","start":46.26,"stop":79.669,"duration":33.41},{"text":"The State Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination did apply to the requirement that a driver must stop at the scene of the accident and identify himself and that the constitutionality of the statute could only be sustained if no use of that information or the fruits was made in any criminal proceeding.","start":79.669,"stop":105.477,"duration":25.81},{"text":"It is our position that the Fifth Amendment does not apply to a requirement that a driver must stop and identify himself to the owner of damaged property or to a person injured on the road and that it is not necessary to bar identification evidence or the fruits to that compliance in any kind of criminal proceeding.","start":105.477,"stop":127.381,"duration":21.9},{"text":"The way in which this case arose procedurally, was that a two-count criminal complaint was filed in the Mendocino County Justice Court for the Ukiah Judicial District in California, charging the respondent Jonathan Todd Byers with two misdemeanor violations of the California Vehicle Code.","start":127.381,"stop":150.166,"duration":22.78},{"text":"Count 1 of the complaint charged that the respondent Byers failed to pass to the left safely as he was overtaking and passing a vehicle proceeding in the same direction.","start":150.166,"stop":161.849,"duration":11.68},{"text":"Count 2 of the complaint charged that he violated the California property damage hit and run statute.","start":161.849,"stop":169.759,"duration":7.91},{"text":"Under that statute, a driver is required to stop at the scene of the accident when he is involved in any accident resulting in property damage and give his name and address to the owner or of the property damaged or the driver of the vehicle damaged.","start":169.759,"stop":186.559,"duration":16.8},{"text":"This requirement is similar to the uniform vehicle code requirement and in fact the laws of all jurisdictions in our country impose similar requirements that driver must stop and identify himself.","start":186.559,"stop":201.022,"duration":14.46},{"text":"The purpose of the statute is to protect against financial loss or where similar requirements are imposed in personal injury hit and run statute to ensure that people will not be left lying hurt and injured on the roads.","start":201.022,"stop":216.991,"duration":15.97},{"text":"There is another section, part of the statute 2, Section 202 and that deals in the case where you have unattended property where the driver or owner of the damaged property cannot be immediately located.","start":216.991,"stop":232.037,"duration":15.05},{"text":"In that case, the driver must leave a note on the car giving that same information and statement of the circumstances and notify the local police.","start":232.037,"stop":242.025,"duration":9.99},{"text":"The purpose of that provision is to make sure that when the owner of the damaged property comes to his property, he will know who to contact in the case when he sees the note or if the note has been lost or destroyed, find out who the owner was from the police.","start":242.025,"stop":260.301,"duration":18.28},{"text":"This particular part of the statute has never been raised and questioned in the proceedings below.","start":260.301,"stop":268.243,"duration":7.94},{"text":"Instead from the outset of the case when the demurrer was first filed to the complaint, the basis of the respondent's argument was that the minimal duty to stop and give the name and address to the driver or owner of the property damaged, violated the privilege against self-incrimination.","start":268.243,"stop":286.618,"duration":18.38},{"text":"The Justice Court dismissed the demurrer.","start":286.618,"stop":289.536,"duration":2.92},{"text":"However, when a writ of prohibition was then taken to the superior court, the superior court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applied to this minimal duty and that the respondent Byers could not be prosecuted for failing to stop at the scene of the accident.","start":289.536,"stop":308.58,"duration":19.04},{"text":"The people filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal.","start":308.58,"stop":312.595,"duration":4.02},{"text":"The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Superior Court.","start":312.595,"stop":317.103,"duration":4.51},{"text":"The Court of Appeal held that the -- it held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination did apply to this identification requirement.","start":317.103,"stop":327.481,"duration":10.38},{"text":"But that the constitutionality of the statute could be sustained if no use were made of the identification evidence or any fruits of the compliance with the statute.","start":327.481,"stop":338.243,"duration":10.76},{"text":"Both parties then filed petitions for hearing with the State Supreme Court.","start":338.243,"stop":343.062,"duration":4.82},{"text":"The State Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals.","start":343.062,"stop":347.273,"duration":4.21},{"text":"It agreed with the Court of Appeals to the extent that it held that all drivers must stop and comply with the statute.","start":347.273,"stop":355.287,"duration":8.01},{"text":"It also agreed with the Court of Appeals that the Fifth Amendment applied to the privilege against self-incrimination.","start":355.287,"stop":362.209,"duration":6.92},{"text":"But it further held that the constitutionality of the statute could be sustained if no use were made of that information in any kind of criminal proceeding that might arise.","start":362.209,"stop":374.355,"duration":12.15},{"text":"The court recognized that this was a new doctrine of jurisprudence because until the decision below, this kind of requirement had been uniformly upheld in California and other elsewhere.","start":374.355,"stop":389.914,"duration":15.56},{"text":"So that the court held that fairness required that the respondent Byer should be excused for his failure to stop at the scene of the accident because the respondent could not have anticipated that the court would impose this kind of use restriction.","start":389.914,"stop":408.34,"duration":18.43},{"text":"We respectfully submit that the decision of the State Supreme Court should be reversed and we have three primary reasons.","start":408.34,"stop":418.259,"duration":9.92}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you understand that the use restriction would include any reliance by the state on the fact that this was the man who -- this was the name of the man who caused the

Renne","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes Your Honor, this is our understanding of the decision.","start":431.427,"stop":437.002,"duration":5.57},{"text":"Now, we might say that the decision doesn't really say that we are estop from the moment the Fifth Amendment applies from the moment -- from mere observation that the man has stopped.","start":437.002,"stop":450.729,"duration":13.73},{"text":"What the State Supreme Court held was that the privilege applies at the moment, driver is required to stop and give his name and address at the scene of the accident and reasonably believes that compliance will result in self-incrimination.","start":450.729,"stop":468.057,"duration":17.33},{"text":"If I might jump ahead of myself just to give a practical illustration of where I think the court's decision leads us and that case is illustrated by a case now pending in the Court of Appeal in California.","start":468.057,"stop":483.878,"duration":15.82},{"text":"The particular facts of the case are that the petitioner who was in fact an unlicensed driver hit a parked car and stopped in California.","start":483.878,"stop":493.53,"duration":9.65},{"text":"He stopped and apparently the owner of the parked car was in a restaurant or the nearby area and the owner came out and the petitioner gave his name and address to the owner of the vehicle.","start":493.53,"stop":506.513,"duration":12.98},{"text":"Some minutes later while the petitioner was standing there talking with the owner of the damaged vehicle, the police arrived on the scene.","start":506.513,"stop":515.385,"duration":8.87},{"text":"It may have been in response to a call, but for some reason the police arrived on the scene.","start":515.385,"stop":521.2,"duration":5.82},{"text":"The petitioner immediately said to the police, my car hit this parked car and I have been drinking.","start":521.2,"stop":529.474,"duration":8.27},{"text":"The police noticed that the petitioner did appear to be a bit unsteady on his feet and he did smell of intoxicants and advised the petitioner of the imply conscience statute, under which petitioner driver is deemed to have given his consent to a Breathalyzer test.","start":529.474,"stop":547.457,"duration":17.98},{"text":"And as a result of that test and the facts, a misdemeanor drunk driving complaint was filed in the California Municipal Court.","start":547.457,"stop":557.593,"duration":10.14},{"text":"The petitioner argued one, that the state could not introduce evidence of his name and address which he had given to the other driver because that was barred by the decision below.","start":557.593,"stop":568.791,"duration":11.2},{"text":"Number two, but for the statute he would not have stopped and then the police wouldn't have found out, wouldn't have arrived on the scene presumably and he wouldn't have told the police that he was drinking and the results of the Breathalyzer test would not have become known.","start":568.791,"stop":587.343,"duration":18.55},{"text":"The Superior Court, although the municipal court refused to dismiss the complaint, the Superior Court held that under the decision below the information as to the name and address was privileged, the statements to the police were privileged and the results of the Breathalyzer test were privileged, even though under other cases of this Court, that information would not be privileged.","start":587.343,"stop":611.256,"duration":23.91}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"So it's your submission General Renne as I understand it that, the decision of the Supreme Court of California in this case means that if a driver damages property and stops along, leaves his name, he first of all of course is not guilty of violation of the hit and run statute and secondly he immunizes himself from any prosecution for any other offense, is that?","start":611.256,"stop":638.535,"duration":27.28}]},{"speakerName":"Louise H.
