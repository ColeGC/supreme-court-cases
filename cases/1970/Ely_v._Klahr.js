issue raised by this appeal that a three-judge District Court sitting in Phoenix, Arizona by its decree of May 19, 1970, abused its discretion and committed error by refusing to assure a preliminary

Phoenix and Tucson, the rural counties, a portion was based on county, 1966 counties, census of following respecting county lines.","start":342.817,"stop":362.983,"duration":20.17},{"text":"Now, the malapportionment resulting from the use of this system, that is to say voter registration in the cities and respecting county lines in rural areas was gross.","start":362.983,"stop":377.54,"duration":14.56},{"text":"They were -- the deviation was plus 16% to cent I believe to minus 6% and that’s just in the county

registration was used.","start":385.231,"stop":393.275,"duration":8.04},{"text":"Nonetheless, this temporary provisional plan, so-called was used in 1966 and again in 1968, the legislature still having failed to act in a valid way.","start":393.275,"stop":408.349,"duration":15.07},{"text":"The legislator did enact, try its hand then again in 1967 and it was declared unconstitutional and then it came back in 1969.","start":408.349,"stop":420.964,"duration":12.62},{"text":"Now, the arguments, physical arguments on part of the respondent is not that the plan is in effect, the new temporary

a gross case of malapportionment.","start":439.031,"stop":441.168,"duration":2.14},{"text":"The argument is that well the Court ordered that this plan be used in the elections of the November 1970, and therefore, it loses its affect, loses its sting after that.","start":441.168,"stop":457.406,"duration":16.24},{"text":"And the reason that we came here to complain was the history does not show
