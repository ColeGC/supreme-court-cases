the case.","start":443.142,"stop":464.199,"duration":21.06},{"text":"That is set forth at page 518 and 519 I think of the record, that was the reason.","start":464.199,"stop":496.412,"duration":32.21},{"text":"Now, coming to the facts of the case, most Sunday newspapers in this country have what I have in my hand a typical comic color supplements.","start":496.412,"stop":508.112,"duration":11.7},{"text":"The supplement has two elements to it basically, a newspaper that wants a supplement has to get two things.","start":508.112,"stop":516.222,"duration":8.11},{"text":"These different features are all copyrighted and the newspaper has to get a license for these features.","start":516.222,"stop":523.303,"duration":7.08},{"text":"In addition, the newspaper has to arrange to have the supplement printed and the printing of comic color supplements is a very -- requires special skill, it’s not something that can be done, they’re done with four different inks and it takes great techniques to accomplish this.","start":523.303,"stop":539.602,"duration":16.3},{"text":"The licenses for using the comic color comics themselves are controlled by the syndicates and the syndicate’s license to a newspaper as many of these particular comics as they want.","start":539.602,"stop":552.375,"duration":12.77},{"text":"Sometimes, the newspaper will get all of its particular comics from a single syndicate more likely it will be a combination in this one of the Washington Post shows that the different comics come from half a dozen or more syndicates.","start":552.375,"stop":568.673,"duration":16.3},{"text":"Now, approximately one third of all of these color comic supplements are printed by the newspapers themselves, the remaining two thirds are printed by the so-called comic color supplement printers which the two merging companies were the two leading ones.","start":568.673,"stop":587.447,"duration":18.77},{"text":"At the time of the acquisition and even to this day, everyone concedes that Greater Buffalo Press is the leader in the comic supplement field, it is the most skilled one.","start":587.447,"stop":598.204,"duration":10.76},{"text":"It is the firm that can produce the best product.","start":598.204,"stop":603.167,"duration":4.96},{"text":"Both of these firms of course produced the same product.","start":603.167,"stop":605.56,"duration":2.39},{"text":"The end result is identical whether or not it’s produced by Greater Buffalo or International, it’s this comic supplement.","start":605.56,"stop":613.224,"duration":7.66},{"text":"But the two firms follow a different method of distributing their product.","start":613.224,"stop":618.144,"duration":4.92},{"text":"Greater Buffalo sells primarily directly to newspapers.","start":618.144,"stop":622.648,"duration":4.5},{"text":"It sells to a few of the syndicates but basically sells to the newspapers.","start":622.648,"stop":627.093,"duration":4.44},{"text":"International has no business relations at all with the newspapers except that it ships the comics, it deals exclusively with King and it has dealt exclusively with King for almost 30 years.","start":627.093,"stop":640.434,"duration":13.34},{"text":"King under the contracts is obligated to give at least 75% of its printing requirements to International.","start":640.434,"stop":651.094,"duration":10.66},{"text":"The other 25% I might add in passing is because on the west coast, it’s just not economically feasible to print in the east and ship it to the west coast because printing is very expensive.","start":651.094,"stop":664.722,"duration":13.63},{"text":"Now, what happens in the case of King is that King goes out and actually sells the comics to the newspapers.","start":664.722,"stop":673,"duration":8.28},{"text":"King sells the comics to the newspapers.","start":673,"stop":675.588,"duration":2.59},{"text":"King has his arrangement with International and has had it for many years under which International does the printing and King’s profit of course represents the difference between what it pays International and what it can sell the comics to the newspapers for.","start":675.588,"stop":692.161,"duration":16.57},{"text":"And the newspapers, all of their business dealings are with King, they pay their bills to King and King in turn then pays International.","start":692.161,"stop":699.974,"duration":7.81},{"text":"But of course, the price that King pays to International necessarily determines what kind of an offer King in turn can make to the newspapers and not unexpectedly, as the record in this case shows that over the years, there were constant battles between King on the one hand and International on the other over price.","start":699.974,"stop":720.449,"duration":20.47},{"text":"And King on occasions forced International to cut its prices in order that King could meet a particular competitive situation.","start":720.449,"stop":729.647,"duration":9.2},{"text":"King had something of a club over1210 International in this respect because up to the time of the merger, King had a six month cancellation clause in its contract.","start":729.647,"stop":739.434,"duration":9.79},{"text":"It could cancel for any reason within six months.","start":739.434,"stop":743.04,"duration":3.61},{"text":"At the time of the merger in June of 1965, King and International were negotiating a new printing contract which they wanted to be a long term contract.","start":743.04,"stop":755.855,"duration":12.82},{"text":"About a month after the acquisition was consummated, they did sign a long term contract with the same prices they had before but it had no six months cancellation clause.","start":755.855,"stop":767.758,"duration":11.9},{"text":"However, and we think this is quite significant as I will come to in a moment, at the time the merger was taking place, a week before the merger agreement was finally signed, International and King had agreed upon the prices to be charged under that contract.","start":767.758,"stop":785.74,"duration":17.98},{"text":"At the time of the merger, King and International each had sales of about $8,500,000.00.","start":785.74,"stop":793.282,"duration":7.54},{"text":"There’s a dispute between the parties as to what their respective shares of the market was.","start":793.282,"stop":798.728,"duration":5.45},{"text":"The disputes is over whether or not in calculating the market, you include in the market printing that is done by newspapers themselves.","start":798.728,"stop":808.492,"duration":9.76},{"text":"The Government contends that that printing should not be included because we say while the newspaper might give its business to one of this printers, it's unlikely that any newspaper would be a source of printing for other newspapers.","start":808.492,"stop":821.249,"duration":12.76},{"text":"Under our study of the market as we interpret under our evaluation of it, together, these two firms had roughly 75% of volume of printing done at the time of the acquisition under the --Mr.","start":821.249,"stop":834.713,"duration":13.46}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

Friedman","textObjs":[{"text":"75% of the two-thirds.","start":838.255,"stop":840.774,"duration":2.52},{"text":"Under the defendant’s evaluation, the two firms together had just under 42% of the whole market.","start":840.774,"stop":848.504,"duration":7.73},{"text":"Their 42% is 42% of the whole market, or it is 75% of the two-third.","start":848.504,"stop":855.035,"duration":6.53},{"text":"But under either standard, these two firms simply dwarf the rest of the industry.","start":855.035,"stop":859.943,"duration":4.91},{"text":"Each of these firms was at least five times as large as any of the other four or five independent printers.","start":859.943,"stop":867.795,"duration":7.85},{"text":"Now, the facts relating to the acquisition were relatively simple, the original organizer of internationally acquired company had been dead for many years.","start":867.795,"stop":878.898,"duration":11.1},{"text":"The stock of the company at the time of the acquisition was owned by two of his children who had made no investment in the company, who had nothing to do with the running of the business, they let Mr. Gorman, the President of International run it and the sole interest was in the dividend, as they could get out of the company.","start":878.898,"stop":896.796,"duration":17.9},{"text":"And finally, they tried to sell this plant in 1952 to Hearst and King and Hearst was not interested.","start":896.796,"stop":904.28,"duration":7.48},{"text":"In 1954, in the December of 1954, negotiations began between the President of International and the President of Greater Buffalo.","start":904.28,"stop":913.328,"duration":9.05},{"text":"International’s men indicated the property, thought could be purchased at the book value and that was ultimately done in June of 1955 at a price of $575,000.00.","start":913.328,"stop":925.58,"duration":12.25},{"text":"The record shows that Gorman, the President of International kept King fully informed during the whole course of these negotiations of what was going on.","start":925.58,"stop":937.836,"duration":12.26},{"text":"And three months before the acquisition took place, in March of 1955, the sale’s manager of King, a man named Knight wrote a memo to his superior in which he pointed out the key role that King occupied in connection with this merger.","start":937.836,"stop":957.4,"duration":19.56},{"text":"As he said that although the owners of International are anxious to sell, they can hardly sell without our consent and cooperation.","start":957.4,"stop":966.08,"duration":8.68},{"text":"And he further added that the Greater Buffalo realizes they can hardly continue the purchased plans without our approval.","start":966.08,"stop":973.679,"duration":7.6},{"text":"Now of course, the reason for King’s control over this thing is quite obvious.","start":973.679,"stop":978.57,"duration":4.89},{"text":"Without the arrangements that International had with King, or International had with the printing plant and no costumers.","start":978.57,"stop":985.41,"duration":6.84},{"text":"International did not have any selling organization.","start":985.41,"stop":988.298,"duration":2.89},{"text":"But on the other hand, King also had a very real stake in this thing because King at this time was basically dependent upon International for its printing.","start":988.298,"stop":997.934,"duration":9.64},{"text":"And I will come in a minute now to what the District Court said and explain the significance of why this interrelationship as a practical matter meant that even though the contract between King and International was not signed until a month after merger in fact, at the time of the merger, Greater Buffalo knew that by acquiring International, it was acquiring basically King’s printing presses.","start":997.934,"stop":1025.873,"duration":27.94},{"text":"The District Court held against us under Section 7 issue on really two grounds.","start":1025.873,"stop":1031.74,"duration":5.87},{"text":"First, the District Court said that because of the advantage King has in selling printing as a result of its control over the features, there were two different markets here, one market said the Court was a printing of comic color supplements for sale directly to the newspapers.","start":1031.74,"stop":1050.951,"duration":19.21},{"text":"And the other market was for sale to the syndicates which then sell them to those newspapers.","start":1050.951,"stop":1057.743,"duration":6.79},{"text":"And then the Court went on and said this -- the effect of this acquisition may not have been substantially to lessen competition because in the first place it said, Greater Buffalo and International not in competition, they’re not in the same markets.","start":1057.743,"stop":1072.491,"duration":14.75},{"text":"International is selling to one market that is to the syndicates, Greater Buffalo is selling only to the other market to the newspapers themselves, they’re not in the same market so there could be no elimination of competition between them.","start":1072.491,"stop":1085.542,"duration":13.05},{"text":"Secondly, they said that since at the time of the -- Court said since at the time of the acquisition, King had no firm contract with International, Greater Buffalo was not acquiring any share of the printing business.","start":1085.542,"stop":1098.45,"duration":12.91},{"text":"It was just acquiring an expectation that with its skills, it could pickup some of this business and finally, it said I any event, International was a failing company.","start":1098.45,"stop":1107.736,"duration":9.29},{"text":"Then at the end of its opinion in the last sentence of the portion dealing with the Section 7 violation, the Court said but even if there were some violations of Section 7 here would not be appropriate to order the divestiture 15 years after the acquisition takes place.","start":1107.736,"stop":1123.991,"duration":16.25}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Does the record show
