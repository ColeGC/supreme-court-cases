critical facts aren’t exactly stated and other critical facts are omitted.","start":52.186,"stop":65.711,"duration":13.52},{"text":"Therefore, I feel called upon as I had not originally intended to go into the facts with the Court particularly since in the cases I have referred to this Court has adopted the salutary policy of reviewing de novo the cases to find whether the standard for constitutional protection pronounced by the Court has been met in the opinion below whether Jury or Court.","start":65.711,"stop":91.374,"duration":25.66},{"text":"In the first place, we are -- Mr. Clark creates an erroneous impression when he says that there was a series of 21 broadcasts, a series of 21 broadcasts on WIP about Mr. Rosenbloom, there was no series at all.","start":91.374,"stop":110.108,"duration":18.73},{"text":"We’re not dealing here with a feature story, we’re not dealing with a documentary, we’re not dealing with the campaign and we’re not

maximum in newscasts by a highly oriented station which every half hour of the day, 24 hours a day, 48 times a day, 320 times a week, every week of the year, everyday of the year, broadcasts every half hour of the year, and every statement before Your Honor fills that category.","start":119.305,"stop":146.1,"duration":26.79},{"text":"It’s a one sentence statement or two sentence statement or a four sentence statement and there is no longer one there.","start":146.1,"stop":152.817,"duration":6.72},{"text":"Now, the second thing my friend Mr. Clark did is he began with the statement of facts which said that on October 1st, there were arrests, 20 of them he said, Mr. Rosenbloom was one.","start":152.817,"stop":165.145,"duration":12.33},{"text":"Well, they were news dealers, they were store operators and they were distributor who supplied these store operators and news dealers, Mr. Rosenbloom.","start":165.145,"stop":176.403,"duration":11.26},{"text":"And then he says the next to that was on October 4, when WIP had a broadcast to which he objects.","start":176.403,"stop":185.259,"duration":8.86},{"text":"Well, Your Honor, a great, great deal happened between October 1 and October 4, to which Mr. Clark did not advert.","start":185.259,"stop":192.99,"duration":7.73},{"text":"What happened here is that is a result of complains from the public, and after a two-month investigation, Mr. Howard Leri, not Captain Ferguson, Mr. Howard Leri I think acknowledged this perhaps at that time America’s leading police commissioner, later commissioner in New York, ordered the arrests by Captain Ferguson and he ordered the crackdown on what he then regarded as obscene material.","start":192.99,"stop":220.407,"duration":27.42},{"text":"I might say to Your Honors that Mr. Clark has made a good deal of Captain Ferguson’s definition and has ridiculed it and has said that this would make the finest paintings in the museum obscene.","start":220.407,"stop":232.753,"duration":12.35},{"text":"But I suggest to Your Honors that just a few years ago, few years before that, we’re now talking about talking about 1963, a Chief Judge of the United States District Court of the State of Washington gave that precise definition of what he thought a majority of the people in the State of Washington considered obscene and a very advertent United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, consisting of three Judges, everyone of whom served as a Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, affirmed on the opinion below stating that the Judge had found the facts.","start":232.753,"stop":263.19,"duration":30.44},{"text":"So there isn’t any shocking finding here, it was erroneous, erroneous under the decisions of this Court.","start":263.19,"stop":269.887,"duration":6.7},{"text":"Well, on October 1st, when the arrest came, all of the city newspapers had headlines about it and necessarily headlines about Mr.

Mr. Clark did not have heard.","start":269.887,"stop":293.348,"duration":23.46},{"text":"And those newspaper articles and that CBS TV telecast said that Mr. Rosenbloom’s products were smut and were

brought a lawsuit about two weeks later and he didn’t name WIP in that lawsuit.","start":307.171,"stop":313.987,"duration":6.82},{"text":"I’m going to show he didn’t know there was a broadcast in WIP until October 27th, weeks later, didn’t even know there was a broadcast, but he brought a suit against all of the newspapers, against the Police Commissioner, against the District Attorney, one for a million dollars in damages and against CBS TV, not WIP, one for a million dollars in damages and the second to enjoin the Police Commissioner and the District Attorney from prosecuting him for criminal violation of the obscenity law and against the newspapers for calling his products smut and obscene and calling him a smut peddler and a peddler of obscene material.","start":313.987,"stop":358.541,"duration":44.55},{"text":"Did not name WIP and he averred there that so great was his damage by virtue of those broadcasts by those people that all, nearly
