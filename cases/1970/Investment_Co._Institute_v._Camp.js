Comptroller of the Currency has authority to permit National banks to operate commingled investment funds for managing agency accounts such as the fund involved in No.59, which just been argued.","start":20.307,"stop":38.342,"duration":18.04},{"text":"Notwithstanding the provisions of the 1933 Glass-Steagall legislation as

prohibited by the Glass-Steagall legislation from engaging in the banking business and conversely that banks are prohibited from operating garden variety or traditional open-end mutual funds.","start":44.804,"stop":66.195,"duration":21.39},{"text":"The narrow issue before the Court, we submit, is whether in sum and substance, a commingled investment account of the kind that has been discussed in the last case in which will be discussed in this case, whether such an account is in sum and substance an ordinary open-end mutual fund.","start":66.195,"stop":83.28,"duration":17.09},{"text":"The petitioners in this case of the Investment Company Institute which represents most of the mutual funds or open-end investment companies in the United States, and the number of individual members of that institute.","start":83.28,"stop":95.574,"duration":12.29},{"text":"The action was brought in the District Court against the Comptroller of the Currency, asserting that his Regulation, 9.18, which purported to permit this type of activity, was unlawful because it violated the Glass-Steagall Act.","start":95.574,"stop":108.945,"duration":13.37},{"text":"And also because it permitted activity in excess of the trust powers which the Comptroller is authorized to grant National banks under Section 92 (a) of the National Banking Act.","start":108.945,"stop":118.592,"duration":9.65},{"text":"The District Court found that the regulations were invalid on both contentions.","start":118.592,"stop":125.282,"duration":6.69},{"text":"The matter was appealed to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals reversed on both matters.","start":125.282,"stop":131.75,"duration":6.47},{"text":"First, I should like to briefly summarize the four sections of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which we believe are applicable to this case.","start":131.75,"stop":141.264,"duration":9.51},{"text":"The Court will recall that the Glass-Steagall legislation was passed in 1933 and was prompted by the almost complete breakdown of this nation’s major financial institutions during the late 1920’s.","start":141.264,"stop":152.927,"duration":11.66},{"text":"A number of reforms in the National banking legislation which are today accepted as common place such as the insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company of National bank deposits and state banks' deposits, and other banking provisions were adopted in the Glass-Steagall legislation.","start":152.927,"stop":171.286,"duration":18.36},{"text":"However, the central purpose of Glass-Steagall was to eliminate the inherent conflicts of interest which are present in the conduct by the same entity or closely affiliated entities of the business of commercial banking on the one hand, the business of receiving deposits.","start":171.286,"stop":188.235,"duration":16.95},{"text":"Subject to demand, the activity of commercial banking on the one hand and the securities business, the business of investment banking or the business of issuing, selling, distributing, and underwriting securities on the other hand.","start":188.235,"stop":203.155,"duration":14.92},{"text":"And there were as I say four central provisions designed to accomplish this purpose.","start":203.155,"stop":207.066,"duration":3.91},{"text":"The keystone provision is Section 21, 12 U.S.C., Section 378.","start":207.066,"stop":212.06,"duration":4.99},{"text":"Now, unlike the other sections that are involved in this case, some of which apply only to National banks and some of which apply only to banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System, and I might mention that all National banks are members of that Federal Reserve System, they are, however, most of the banks in the United States are state banks which are not members of the Federal Reserve System, but unlike those other sections, Section 21 applies to all banks, state or national, members or not members of the Federal Reserve System.","start":212.06,"stop":239.248,"duration":27.19},{"text":"In the broadest possible language, Section 21 requires the complete divorce of the business of commercial banking from the business -- from the securities business.","start":239.248,"stop":249.866,"duration":10.62},{"text":"It prohibits the simultaneous engagement in the business of receiving deposits subject to withdrawal by check or other means, which namely is the business of commercial banking and engaging at the same time in the business of issuing or underwriting, or selling, or distributing stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities.","start":249.866,"stop":269.284,"duration":19.42},{"text":"Section 16 of the National Banking Act is also relevant.","start":269.284,"stop":272.71,"duration":3.43},{"text":"It however applies only to National banks and indeed is the provision of the National Banking Act which sets forth the corporate powers of the National banks.","start":272.71,"stop":281.61,"duration":8.9},{"text":"In doing so, it enacted two limitations or -- I beg pardon, two exemptions to the broad provisions of the other provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act.","start":281.61,"stop":291.255,"duration":9.64},{"text":"It did first permit and authorized National banks to underwrite and sell a strictly limited list of government bonds.","start":291.255,"stop":297.691,"duration":6.44},{"text":"And secondly, it expressly confirmed the right of all National banks, whether or not they exercised trust powers, to perform an accommodation service for customers by permitting banks to purchase some sale securities solely upon the order and for the account of customers, and not for the account of the bank.","start":297.691,"stop":317.004,"duration":19.31},{"text":"I refer to this is an accommodation service.","start":317.004,"stop":319.362,"duration":2.36},{"text":"The legislative history makes it clear and become contemporaneous publications of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1933 and 1934 make it clear that this service was intended for the smaller banks located in smaller communities where the ordinary services of the broker dealer were not available.","start":319.362,"stop":334.011,"duration":14.65},{"text":"That situation may not prevail to a great extent today, but certainly in 1933, there were many communities where the banker was the only man who could buy or sell a security solely upon an order and for the account of the customer, that was the second exception permitted by Section 16.","start":334.011,"stop":351.902,"duration":17.89},{"text":"However, in granting these two very limited exceptions, Congress made it clear in Section 16 once again that a broad prohibition of -- a broad repeal of the prohibitions of Section 21 were not intended because Section 16 specifically says that a bank may not underwrite any issue of securities or stock.","start":351.902,"stop":373.898,"duration":22},{"text":"The third provision applicable here, Section 32 and also I should refer to Section 20.","start":373.898,"stop":379.107,"duration":5.21},{"text":"These two sections were intended to prevent the violation of the prohibitions of Section 21 through the-- indirectly, through the use of affiliations or interlocks.","start":379.107,"stop":388.588,"duration":9.48},{"text":"Section 32 which applies only to member banks provides that no person affiliated with a company primarily engaged in the issue or floatation, underwriting, public sell or distribution of securities may serve at the same time as an officer or director or employee of a member bank.","start":388.588,"stop":405.402,"duration":16.81},{"text":"Section 20 prohibited certain defined affiliations between member banks on the one hand and corporations engaged principally in the issue of floatation, underwriting and so forth of stocks and bonds.","start":405.402,"stop":417.631,"duration":12.23},{"text":"And so Sections 32 and 20 were intended to prohibit indirect violations of the broad prohibition of Section 21.","start":417.631,"stop":425.736,"duration":8.11},{"text":"Now as I have previously indicated, we believe that the narrow issue before the Court is whether a bank commingled investment fund of the type here under consideration is in sum and substance a mutual fund.","start":425.736,"stop":436.919,"duration":11.18},{"text":"It has been repeatedly held by the Federal Reserve Board that a traditional mutual fund is subject to the Glass-Steagall Act.","start":436.919,"stop":444.414,"duration":7.5},{"text":"That the activity of a traditional mutual fund is the kind of activity contemplated by the Glass-Steagall Act.","start":444.414,"stop":451.809,"duration":7.4},{"text":"And this fact seems to be conceded all around.","start":451.809,"stop":453.642,"duration":1.83},{"text":"It seems to be conceded that a bank as I say may not operate a traditional mutual fund, nor may a traditional mutual fund go into the banking business.","start":453.642,"stop":462.184,"duration":8.54},{"text":"So then we come to the question, is there a significant difference between this fund and a traditional mutual fund, or are they as we contend in sum and substance, the very same thing.","start":462.184,"stop":472.447,"duration":10.26},{"text":"I think in order to demonstrate this point with clarity, I should like to stress several of the characteristics of traditional mutual funds and demonstrate how the commingled investment fund, typified by the City Bank fund before the Court are in sum and substance, the same thing as a matter of law.","start":472.447,"stop":493.013,"duration":20.57},{"text":"A traditional mutual fund typically is corporate in form.","start":493.013,"stop":496.794,"duration":3.78},{"text":"However, there are many traditional mutual funds that are non-corporate entities such as trusts or other business associations.","start":496.794,"stop":504.738,"duration":7.94},{"text":"A traditional mutual fund is continually issuing participations or ownership interests in the funds.","start":504.738,"stop":511.415,"duration":6.68},{"text":"They are frequently called shares of common stock because a traditional mutual fund is typically or frequently a corporation, but mutual fund shares of the garden variety type also have a variety of other names, such as beneficial interests, participate in agreements and the like.","start":511.415,"stop":526.808,"duration":15.39},{"text":"Now, in the case of the commingled investment fund of the National City Bank, their ownership interests or participations are called “units of participation,” very similar to the participating agreements that are issued by some traditional mutual funds.","start":526.808,"stop":541.331,"duration":14.52},{"text":"Also in the case of the City Bank’s fund, it is not a corporate entity, but it is a separate entity and has been so recognized and is registered under the Investment Company Act, as has been indicated in the prior case.","start":541.331,"stop":554.164,"duration":12.83},{"text":"The ownership interests or participations in an ordinary and open-end mutual fund, maybe issued subject to a sales charge or they may be issued on a so called no load basis, where no sales charge is exacted.","start":554.164,"stop":568.857,"duration":14.69},{"text":"The ownership interests in the bank commingled fund of the City Bank type are sold on this no load basis.","start":568.857,"stop":575.853,"duration":7},{"text":"An ordinary mutual fund typically invests and reinvests the proceeds from the sale of the securities in the fund in the portfolio securities in accordance with the investment policy stated for the fund.","start":575.853,"stop":586.747,"duration":10.89},{"text":"The bank mutual fund of the kind that we have under consideration here does exactly the same thing.","start":586.747,"stop":591.496,"duration":4.75},{"text":"It has adopted an investment policy.","start":591.496,"stop":593.385,"duration":1.89},{"text":"It sells the securities in the fund and invests the proceeds of those securities in accordance with the stated investment policy.","start":593.385,"stop":601.934,"duration":8.55},{"text":"The securities issued by the ordinary mutual fund are not traded back and forth on the New York Stock Exchange or any stock exchange in the ordinary course, nor they are traded in the over the counter market.","start":601.934,"stop":611.442,"duration":9.51},{"text":"Rather an investor in an ordinary mutual fund who desires to get his money merely turns the -- his certificate into the fund and it is redeemed in cash for its asset value.","start":611.442,"stop":624.145,"duration":12.7},{"text":"Indeed, that is the hallmark of an open-end investment company, the right at any time to redeem your investment for cash.","start":624.145,"stop":630.448,"duration":6.3},{"text":"The same privilege is available in exactly the same form
