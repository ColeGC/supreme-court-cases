retroactivity.","start":335.286,"stop":341.178,"duration":5.89},{"text":"It would seem to be that we have a situation where if Mr. Williams -- if Mr. Chimel had not been so fortunate to arrive here before the Supreme Court of the United States before us, we might very well be here today arguing the same matters that were argued in front of us -- in front of the Court by Chimel and very well have a ruling consistent with Chimel that it was an illegal search and seizure.","start":341.178,"stop":369.001,"duration":27.82},{"text":"And in a effect by refusing to give retroactivity to this particular case on a direct appeal from a Federal Court, we are creating an equity in the law in that we are differentiating between merely because a man has not been as fast as someone else in coming here to Supreme Court of United States.","start":369.001,"stop":390.054,"duration":21.05},{"text":"It is felt that all the cases in which and this is Supreme Court has heard many times and which --

in this particular case, and that Chimel is not a new area in that, it just in effect advised law enforcement authorities of what is reasonable, what is a reasonable search incidental to an arrest?","start":405.064,"stop":424.639,"duration":19.57},{"text":"Harris came out and then the Court later on in Trepino specifically overruled Harris and again specifically held that the search incidental to an arrest should be strictly construed.","start":424.639,"stop":436.066,"duration":11.43},{"text":"Rabinowitz, in the language of Rabinowitz which is specifically holds that Rabinowitz is to be considered on its facts that the reasonableness of a search is to be considered by all of facts and circumstances arriving at that particular situation.","start":436.066,"stop":452.43,"duration":16.36},{"text":"And I would submit to the Court that the facts and situation in this particular case were such that the fact situation that they did not violate so to speak the dictates of Rabinowitz in this particular search.","start":452.43,"stop":467.416,"duration":14.99},{"text":"In Rabinowitz, there was a one room office, there was arrest warrant.","start":467.416,"stop":472.535,"duration":5.12},{"text":"The search is for an hour-and-a-half and there was a public place with exclusive possession in the part of Rabinowitz.","start":472.535,"stop":478.696,"duration":6.16},{"text":"In our particular case, we had a private home, the Government was not able to establish who owned the home, who actually had possession of the home.","start":478.696,"stop":489.927,"duration":11.23},{"text":"The search lasted for over two hours with an arrest warrant and approximately seven homes were searched, seven -- I would say that this particular case in facts situation is closer to the Von Cleef in which the Supreme Court specifically held that it was a illegal search pursuant the Harris, Rabinowitz rule.","start":489.927,"stop":511.421,"duration":21.49},{"text":"And for that reason, they – if the Court should deem that retroactivity should not be applied in this particular case that it would reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit based upon the fact that it was an illegal search even without the ruling of Chimel","start":511.421,"stop":530.512,"duration":19.09},{"text":".I believe that the -- again, the question of retroactivity, the closest case I can really come to, it is the Spinelli case in which I think there’s no doubt about it that no one argues as to retroactivity of Spinelli.","start":530.512,"stop":545.919,"duration":15.41},{"text":"I think Spinelli again took the search warrant in the narcotics case and expressed what would be required, what is required to show probable cause to a magistrate?","start":545.919,"stop":555.201,"duration":9.28},{"text":"I believe Chimel has merely stated what is necessary what is probable cause, what is the basis for a search incidental to an arrest, and the similarity between the two are quite close.","start":555.201,"stop":568.558,"duration":13.36},{"text":"Neither one is -- sets up new law such as the tight Desist opinion which in effect says that Katz is -- will not be replied retroactive and it’s quite clear that before Katz electronics eavesdropping was allowed although the Court was starting to mitigate it in many aspects, but it’s still is allowed in this particular session just do without completely.","start":568.558,"stop":592.798,"duration":24.24},{"text":"I think Mr. Miller has covered that in his appendix which we also cite in our brief quite excellently and I would submit to the Court that in view of the fact that this was a direct appeal, on view of the fact that we specifically argued Chimel two years before Chimel ever came out that in a fact if the what -- if the Court denied our request at this time then, in effect what the Court would have to say is if the Ninth Circuit or in effect if the lower court had granted our motion and the Government in someway and a motion is suppress which that they have a right to appeal could come up and say, object to it and argue that it was not a valid ruling by the trial court.","start":592.798,"stop":638.563,"duration":45.76},{"text":"I think this would be ludicrous and yet because the trial court so to speak goofed, did not follow the law the way it should have been because we arrived approximately a year after Chimel before this Court we are based with the different decision.","start":638.563,"stop":656.042,"duration":17.48},{"text":"I don’t think and I don’t feel that this is equal protection in law which should be given -- being given to Mr.
