1961.","start":327.707,"stop":334.531,"duration":6.82},{"text":"In the Sussman case, which was a case I referred to a moment ago being in the Third Circuit, that was filed in July of the -- of the

bankrupt.","start":438.981,"stop":447.442,"duration":8.46},{"text":"And they say so, and they say it's a windfall but they say the statute reads exactly the way it says and we're not going to attempt

right.","start":474.672,"stop":479.166,"duration":4.49},{"text":"They provided both the provision of 31 U.S.C., that's Section 3477, which says declaring all assignments of any claim upon the United

appeared before the Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, I was armed with the First Circuit's opinion and the Third Circuit's opinion.","start":539.063,"stop":546.502,"duration":7.44},{"text":"And Mr. Rochelle came up with just some magazine articles and a few law journal reviews and I thought I was well armed.","start":546.502,"stop":555.031,"duration":8.53},{"text":"But apparently, the Fifth Circuit didn't take the same view because the Fifth Circuit “swam around” and said this and I do bring this to the Court's attention because this is a test case.","start":555.031,"stop":565.339,"duration":10.31},{"text":"This is one of the first impression for this Court because we now have our Circuit Courts in conflict and I would do want to recite --

Act.","start":565.339,"stop":586.848,"duration":21.51},{"text":"Now, the reason that you find so much noise about that in the journals is that the referees in bankruptcies have discovered that this might be a tremendous thing to make because they could then take all the loses the bankrupts may have had and check back and see if they have paid any income tax.","start":586.848,"stop":607.685,"duration":20.84},{"text":"There might be a source of revenue or income to the bankruptcy courts.","start":607.685,"stop":612.505,"duration":4.82},{"text":"On the

-- that there was a property right, just presumingly.","start":616.804,"stop":627.631,"duration":10.83},{"text":"Then, this comes to my mind.","start":627.631,"stop":630.199,"duration":2.57},{"text":"The statute provides for a three-year loss-carryback and the five-year forward.","start":630.199,"stop":637.103,"duration":6.9},{"text":"Now, what happens here?","start":637.103,"stop":638.746,"duration":1.64},{"text":"Here in September, take my client's position, in September 21st, 1961, they take bankruptcy.","start":638.746,"stop":647.01,"duration":8.26},{"text":"Now, they had to do something to the remainder of that

record.","start":651.754,"stop":654.279,"duration":2.52},{"text":"The referee in bankruptcy makes those findings as to how much additional loses may have been sustained by my clients between September and December the 31st of 1961.","start":654.279,"stop":669.446,"duration":15.17},{"text":"Now, the Fifth Circuit, in order to justify its finding, it does this.","start":669.446,"stop":674.437,"duration":4.99},{"text":"It says, one, that this one involved shouldn't go to the bankrupt.","start":674.437,"stop":678.884,"duration":4.45},{"text":"It should protect the creditors.","start":678.884,"stop":681.543,"duration":2.66},{"text":"And that this refund should then go back to the bankruptcy court and made available for questions.","start":681.543,"stop":687.228,"duration":5.68},{"text":"Now, if he's trying to -- if the Court is trying to protect the creditors, he is only protecting the creditors who are listed in the -- in the schedule of bankruptcy in the bankruptcy court.","start":687.228,"stop":699.438,"duration":12.21},{"text":"What about the creditors that were created between September the 21st and December the 31st?","start":699.438,"stop":706.23,"duration":6.79},{"text":"They are not in there.","start":706.23,"stop":707.839,"duration":1.61},{"text":"Now, whatever loses they may lose to these people, they're not protected.","start":707.839,"stop":712.858,"duration":5.02},{"text":"So when you get the listing, you get another problem.","start":712.858,"stop":715.631,"duration":2.77},{"text":"How far can you reach out if this law abuses the taxpayer right to go five years forward?Does this mean that a bankrupt for five years has his hands tied?","start":715.631,"stop":725.813,"duration":10.18},{"text":"Does it mean that anytime in five years, that the referees or the trustee in bankruptcy, he comes and asks “I want to see your books.","start":725.813,"stop":732.904,"duration":7.09},{"text":"I want to see what kind of year you had here” and determine when he wants to make this loss book of the former deal to be able to get some money into the estate.","start":732.904,"stop":743.606,"duration":10.7},{"text":"Now, there's got to be a closeout somewhere.","start":743.606,"stop":746.441,"duration":2.84},{"text":"I think this.","start":746.441,"stop":747.453,"duration":1.01},{"text":"I think very seriously that it was or is windfall.","start":747.453,"stop":751.311,"duration":3.86},{"text":"The amount of money that's involved in this case is nothing because when we did make to recover of these refunds, the small business administration has the money come and it grab its money real quick and left us with some pennies.","start":751.311,"stop":764.583,"duration":13.27},{"text":"But we had an issue and we have one which we felt was important.","start":764.583,"stop":768.763,"duration":4.18},{"text":"And more especially, if you think we have our Circuit Courts who do not agree.","start":768.763,"stop":773.169,"duration":4.41},{"text":"Now I'll say this.","start":773.169,"stop":774.883,"duration":1.71},{"text":"It's true that the opinions of the First and the Third Circuit were not very popular but by the same token, my clients of bankrupt weren't very popular to their creditors back home either.","start":774.883,"stop":785.461,"duration":10.58},{"text":"But in any event, I think what you're going to have to do -- you're going to have to construe the question.","start":785.461,"stop":790.403,"duration":4.94},{"text":"And there's only two questions.","start":790.403,"stop":791.645,"duration":1.24},{"text":"One, does Section 7 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act does it if the language by introduces property including rights of action which prior to the filing of a petition, prior to the filing of a petition, he could by any means have transferred.","start":791.645,"stop":813.66,"duration":22.01},{"text":"Now, could the bankrupts in this case on September the 21st, could they, when the statute meritoriously says, “You cannot make an application for a refund until your whole taxable year has been completed.”","start":813.66,"stop":827.973,"duration":14.31},{"text":"Could they on September the 21st stop, put an application, right then and there or ascertain a claim that we got a refund coming right now.","start":827.973,"stop":837.124,"duration":9.15},{"text":"No, the statute prohibited.","start":837.124,"stop":839.027,"duration":1.9},{"text":"The statute where it specifically says, “If you have to complete your calendar year”, the calendar year of December 31st.","start":839.027,"stop":846.485,"duration":7.46},{"text":"So the question is, did the bankrupt have the property right in the anticipated, if they could have been anticipated, and they anticipated lost or loss-carryback and refund.","start":846.485,"stop":859.704,"duration":13.22},{"text":"The second part is that presuming you find that there was a property right, then the next question is, does -- is it in conflict with the statute that prevents the assignment of a claim against the United States Government.","start":859.704,"stop":874.547,"duration":14.84},{"text":"Now, there are other cases that are cited both sides and I think there's was a quite conflict on it.","start":874.547,"stop":881.362,"duration":6.81},{"text":"But I think there is no conflict on issues, strictly one of law, this question as to whether or not there was a property right at the time
