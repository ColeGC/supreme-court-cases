one of the parties to the case is a labor union.","start":34.844,"stop":45.743,"duration":10.9},{"text":"Now this case was instituted in the State Courts of North Carolina, the County Court of Mecklenburg County.","start":45.743,"stop":53.574,"duration":7.83},{"text":"The respondent here, the company filed a complaint against the union, alleging that it had been libel by a pamphlet distributed by the union.","start":53.574,"stop":65.34,"duration":11.77},{"text":"It sought as damages $100,000 actual damages and $100,000 punitive damages.","start":65.34,"stop":75.925,"duration":10.58},{"text":"The only parties to the action were the company which was the plaintiff and the union which was the defendant.","start":75.925,"stop":83.243,"duration":7.32},{"text":"The union removed the case to the Federal District Court, alleging the diversity of citizenship existed.","start":83.243,"stop":90.842,"duration":7.6},{"text":"It asserted in its removal papers that the plaintiff company was a citizen of North Carolina, because incorporated there and having its principal place of business there, and that the defendant union was a citizen of Pennsylvania, because they were not incorporated that was the state of its principal place of business.","start":90.842,"stop":111.366,"duration":20.52},{"text":"The company moved that the case be remanded to the state court.","start":111.366,"stop":116.209,"duration":4.84},{"text":"It acknowledged that it was a citizen of North Carolina.","start":116.209,"stop":120.079,"duration":3.87},{"text":"It did not dispute the union's contention that Pennsylvania was its principal place of business.","start":120.079,"stop":126.567,"duration":6.49},{"text":"But it asserted that notwithstanding those facts diversity of citizenship did not exist because it said a union has no citizenship for diversity purposes, and that the courts must treat it when it's a party, as though it were a citizen of every state in which it has a member.","start":126.567,"stop":145.421,"duration":18.85},{"text":"Since this union, the United Steelworkers has a member in each of the 50 states, including of course North Carolina, this meant on the company's theory that no diversity of citizenship existed.","start":145.421,"stop":159.467,"duration":14.05},{"text":"The district judge refused to remand the case.","start":159.467,"stop":162.825,"duration":3.36},{"text":"He held as the union had urged that it was a citizen of its principal place of business, Pennsylvania and that this was therefore a suit between a North Carolina plaintiff and a Pennsylvania defendant.","start":162.825,"stop":175.261,"duration":12.44},{"text":"The company sought and obtained interlocutory review and the Court of Appeals reversed.","start":175.261,"stop":182.355,"duration":7.09},{"text":"It held as the company urged, that a union has no citizenship of its own and that the district court must look to the citizenship of each of its members and that therefore a union such as this one with members in each of the 50 states, is to be treated as though it were a citizen of each of the 50 states and therefore incapable of removing cases to the federal courts on the ground of diversity of citizenship.","start":182.355,"stop":209.552,"duration":27.2},{"text":"The question before this Court therefore, is whether labor union shall be treated as corporations have since 1844, as having a citizenship distinct from that of their members or in the corporate case their shareholders, or whether they are to have as the Court below held no citizenship and therefore be deemed citizens of every state in which they have a member.","start":209.552,"stop":237.598,"duration":28.05},{"text":"Now of course the governing standard is Article III, Section 2, of the Constitution which creates the diversity ground and 28 U.S.C., Section 1332 (a), which confers that grant upon the lower District Courts and both speak in identical words.","start":237.598,"stop":256.009,"duration":18.41},{"text":"The Constitution provides that the judicial power, the federal judicial power, shall extend to

states.","start":271.049,"stop":284.55,"duration":13.5},{"text":"The question therefore is whether under these provisions the union like the corporation is a citizen, and in our view the beginning of that inquiry is to look to the purpose of the diversity jurisdiction, and to see whether it applies to unions as to corporations, so as to warrant their being treated as a single entity.","start":284.55,"stop":305.442,"duration":20.89},{"text":"Now there have been historically great debates about what the purpose of the diversity jurisdiction is, and what it was when it was originally conferred.","start":305.442,"stop":314.319,"duration":8.88},{"text":"But from the time of Alexander Hamilton's statements in Federalist Number 80, down through the legislative history of the Congressional amendments in 1958, one overriding purpose has been consistently expressed and we think must be accepted as the governing justification for the diversity jurisdiction.","start":314.319,"stop":335.501,"duration":21.18},{"text":"And that purpose is that a neutral forum, a federal forum be provided, when an outsider is forced to litigate in the courts of its adversary or in the geographic region of his adversary.","start":335.501,"stop":351.451,"duration":15.95},{"text":"The theory was as Alexander Hamilton put it in the Federalist, that in such cases the state tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial.","start":351.451,"stop":361.017,"duration":9.57},{"text":"And as concluded by the Judicial Conference in the 1950's and adopted in the Congressional reports in 1958, there is a great bulk of expert opinion from those who litigate in the courts, that local prejudice continues to exist and that the federal courts are in truth a strong protection against it.","start":361.017,"stop":380.179,"duration":19.16},{"text":"Now, we submit that the labor union today going into those states where it is not principally found, is subjected to and receives as much local prejudice as does a corporation, which though present in that state is not principally found there.","start":380.179,"stop":397.512,"duration":17.33},{"text":"And that the purpose of the diversity grant under the statutory conferral of that grant is equally applicable to the union, as to the corporation.","start":397.512,"stop":406.338,"duration":8.83},{"text":"To demonstrate that indeed we do encounter local prejudice we have appended to our brief just a few leaflets which were introduced at one Congressional hearing, to show the kinds of local appeals which are made to persuade people to reject unions, when they are running labor board elections.","start":406.338,"stop":424.984,"duration":18.65},{"text":"Now, these were submitted by one union and they refer to one area of the country.","start":424.984,"stop":429.497,"duration":4.51},{"text":"That these leaflets are encountered by unions and these appeals to local prejudice are encountered by unions, all unions not just this one, in many sections of the country, indeed in all of those where they are not -- what might be described as the non-industrial states, those where the unions are not commonly found and principally found and very much at home.","start":429.497,"stop":450.841,"duration":21.34},{"text":"And the common theme of all of these leaflets is that the union is the outsider, don't let this outsider into our community, let's not bring this outsider into our community and they reflect what really is today an economic conflict between the states.","start":450.841,"stop":467.532,"duration":16.69},{"text":"We have today a great battle to attract industry between the states.","start":467.532,"stop":472.945,"duration":5.41},{"text":"We have some states trying to keep it and others trying to attract it and all of them very busily engaged in what is this form of economic competition.","start":472.945,"stop":481.073,"duration":8.13},{"text":"And some of those states have sought industry and advertised for it, on the ground that labor standards are a less expensive here and that this is an attraction, which you should look at when deciding to come here.","start":481.073,"stop":494.763,"duration":13.69},{"text":"As a result of this conflict people in those states which are seeking business on this basis are constantly urged, as they are in some of these leaflets and editorial, constantly urged to reject the unions, let's not let them in here, because once they come in this great argument that we have to attract business to this region will disappear.","start":494.763,"stop":517.553,"duration":22.79},{"text":"So that when a union is sued in the State Courts of such a state, where such appeals have been made, and where such local prejudice against them does indeed exist, it faces a mighty burden and a mighty danger.","start":517.553,"stop":530.441,"duration":12.89},{"text":"In this case for example, a prominent local corporation is seeking damages to the tune of $200,000 against a union which has come to that state and sought to organize its employees.","start":530.441,"stop":544.389,"duration":13.95},{"text":"Now, to be sure this union does have a few more members in that state, they constitute less,

is not a broad one which says that every unincorporated association is a citizen, but one which looks to the legal characteristics of the association to determine whether in fact it is so viewed as an entity distinct from it's members, that it is likely to be subjected to the prejudice of an entity or whether in fact it is primarily a loose group of people associated together which perhaps has a few characteristics of a legal entity, but not very many.","start":637.427,"stop":675.89,"duration":38.46},{"text":"We think indeed that this Court has already said that in Puerto Rico versus Russell

today.","start":681.022,"stop":696.558,"duration":15.54},{"text":"For many more purposes the partnership is not an entity but two men joined together, who are treated as two individuals for numerous

members.","start":707.378,"stop":712.96,"duration":5.58},{"text":"Indeed it is now I think safely to be said treated as much an entity as is a corporation and we will show this I hope in the course of the argument.","start":712.96,"stop":725.682,"duration":12.72},{"text":"Now to be sure we have spelled out the prejudice which we, the labor union fear, the local prejudice which we fear in certain states, but this is not a one sided matter.","start":725.682,"stop":736.032,"duration":10.35},{"text":"There are those who must sue the union where it can be found in its states, who feel that in such

to reach an appellate court in which it's been the labor union asserting that diversity exists.","start":747.963,"stop":756.786,"duration":8.82},{"text":"There have been only a few cases in the appellate court that those that have gotten there with the exception of this one, have been cases when the labor union is adversary in the proceeding, usually an individuals, sometimes a corporation, is alleging and asserting that diversity exists and that therefore they are entitled to the protections of the federal courts.","start":756.786,"stop":774.75,"duration":17.96},{"text":"This is very

side you are on, someone would like to be in federal courts for its protections, where indeed you have citizens of different states.","start":779.771,"stop":793.246,"duration":13.48},{"text":"Now the plaintiff, the person who wishes to sue the union has gotten rather sympathetic treatment from some of the Courts of Appeals including the Court below.","start":793.246,"stop":804.116,"duration":10.87},{"text":"They recognize, indeed they say it would be a failure of justice if one could not bring the labor union into the federal courts on diversity grounds and they have therefore approved the procedure of suing union in a class action, not naming the union, but naming certain representatives of the union as the defendants, being careful to select only representatives who's citizenship is distinct from the plaintiffs.","start":804.116,"stop":827.41,"duration":23.29},{"text":"And then under the prevailing doctrines of this Court, since you look only to the representatives of the class to determine diversity, then finding that there is here diversity of jurisdiction because the plaintiff is a citizen of state A and the particular of representatives of the labor union named are not citizens of state A.","start":827.41,"stop":844.444,"duration":17.03},{"text":"And they have said that this procedure allowing this class action was essential to bring the labor unions into the federal courts on diversity grounds and essential to prevent the failure of justice.","start":844.444,"stop":857.667,"duration":13.22},{"text":"We submit however that while that decision and the desire to bring the federal court -- the labor unions into the federal courts as defendants is entire sound.","start":857.667,"stop":867.26,"duration":9.59},{"text":"That it's grossly unfair to say that the labor union likewise doesn't have the opportunity to remove it's case to the federal courts on diversity grounds, because the consequence is that the plaintiff is given the absolute option.","start":867.26,"stop":878.909,"duration":11.65},{"text":"This North Carolina citizen who wants to sue what really is a Pennsylvania corporation can choose which court we will be in, if it wants to sue us in federal court it sue as a class and it will have diversity under the decisions of the court below.","start":878.909,"stop":892.801,"duration":13.89},{"text":"But if it wants to prevent us access to the federal courts, it may only sue us in our common name as an entity

justice than one which would keep both parties out of the federal court.","start":905.95,"stop":913.781,"duration":7.83},{"text":"And so we submit that if this question were one of first impression and for reasons which I'll get into, we don't think it is, that looking to the purpose of the diversity jurisdiction, looking to the fact that this Court has since 1844 concluded that, that purpose warrants treating a corporation as a citizen, that likewise a labor union should be treated as a citizen for diversity purposes.","start":913.781,"stop":936.953,"duration":23.17},{"text":"But we think
