with the very familiar question of capital gain versus ordinary income.","start":55.856,"stop":74.822,"duration":18.97},{"text":"It involves a -- an acquisition by a group of persons as a joint venture and acquisition of some 45 acres in the Los Angeles area with the purpose of developing it and holding it for rental.","start":74.822,"stop":98.017,"duration":23.19},{"text":"There was testimony indicating that financing -- that there were financing and zoning problems and that incase -- incase these problems were not solve -- couldn't be solved that they would sell the property off in bulk so they wouldn't get hurt.","start":98.017,"stop":125.53,"duration":27.51},{"text":"The District Court made that distinct finding that they would sell it off in bulk so they wouldn't get hurt.","start":125.53,"stop":139.192,"duration":13.66},{"text":"The -- they also made a finding and in the same very -- very same paragraph that they were holding it for sale or development for rental whichever was more profitable.","start":139.192,"stop":163.471,"duration":24.28},{"text":"During the course of the escrow -- there was a six months escrow and during the force of that escrow, there was considerable investigation of financing many efforts to get first on a total project, a thousand apartments for the whole thing.","start":163.471,"stop":183.541,"duration":20.07},{"text":"Then when they couldn't that, they broke it down into getting smaller units financed.","start":183.541,"stop":194.026,"duration":10.49},{"text":"For that purpose, it was necessary to subdivide the property in order to cut it down to small units.","start":194.026,"stop":200.952,"duration":6.93},{"text":"But even there and I'm reciting the history chiefly as the Court Appeals relates it.","start":200.952,"stop":209.549,"duration":8.6},{"text":"And the Court of Appeals obtain, I believe, it has a very good opening statement of the factual history of the case.","start":209.549,"stop":220.93,"duration":11.38},{"text":"They had to break it down into a number of units in order to be able to finance it on a unit basis instead on a single basis that even at that point they were still hoping to withhold what they the frontages, two strips, one on one street, one on the other for commercial development and rental.","start":220.93,"stop":243.794,"duration":22.86},{"text":"But they weren't able to finance the -- even this and this was -- all took place during the six months period of escrow.","start":243.794,"stop":253.134,"duration":9.34},{"text":"And so as the Court of Appeals points out, they were then faced with interest, charges, and payments, and taxes, and so they sold the subdivided portion.","start":253.134,"stop":265.312,"duration":12.18},{"text":"They sold it out.","start":265.312,"stop":268.274,"duration":2.96},{"text":"They reported the ordinary income on that.","start":268.274,"stop":270.84,"duration":2.57},{"text":"Apparently on the theory that since it was subdivided, they have to report it as ordinary.","start":270.84,"stop":276.547,"duration":5.71},{"text":"I don't think that question is before this Court ago as to whether that was right or whether it was wrong or whether it had any bearing on their estimate.","start":276.547,"stop":288.706,"duration":12.16},{"text":"Anyway on the question of the purpose, I think the record is very clear that at no time and there is no suggestion anywhere in the record that there was ever a purpose of selling in order to make a profit.","start":288.706,"stop":312.352,"duration":23.65},{"text":"Respondent's briefs attempts page after page, after page to develop some words, somewhere in the record that shows that but it's a total failure and I covered that in our replied brief.","start":312.352,"stop":329.643,"duration":17.29},{"text":"No record and the record is there anything to support the idea that there was ever a plan to sell the property in order to make a profit.","start":329.643,"stop":340.497,"duration":10.85},{"text":"And the finding of the District Court itself says, “That if their plans for development for income purposes would not carry out, were not successful, they would sell it off in bulk so they wouldn't get hurt.”","start":340.497,"stop":358.645,"duration":18.15},{"text":"And insofar -- as far as I can see, that in itself indicates no idea of making profit on the thing like that.","start":358.645,"stop":366.513,"duration":7.87},{"text":"In fact, it's the very reverse, it's what any normal businessman would do, if went into an investment program.","start":366.513,"stop":374.821,"duration":8.31},{"text":"At some point, he would try to protect himself so he wouldn't get hurt.","start":374.821,"stop":380.279,"duration":5.46},{"text":"That was all it was there.","start":380.279,"stop":382.521,"duration":2.24},{"text":"Now, there is a similar conflict you might say in the opinion of the Court of Appeals which I will come to.","start":382.521,"stop":401.269,"duration":18.75},{"text":"But, on that question, on the question of purpose and I might say hereto that after our open brief was filed, the Government brought up as part of the record as an addition to the record, the exhibits in the case.","start":401.269,"stop":420.609,"duration":19.34},{"text":"And there was one exhibit there, the opening agreement of the partnership which shows its purpose, a very detailed agreement and nowhere, not in that document not anywhere else is there the least suggestion.","start":420.609,"stop":439.08,"duration":18.47},{"text":"And the efforts of respondent to find a suggestion of a profit purpose has let it in it's brief -- in his brief into the some of the strangest conceptions of logic that I have ever seen.","start":439.08,"stop":463.388,"duration":24.31},{"text":"But we have covered that in our reply brief and I don't want to take the time to repeat that now.","start":463.388,"stop":472.499,"duration":9.11},{"text":"On the second question which perhaps is the question why this Court granted certiorari, the question as to whether assuming that situation that there could be such a thing under the tax law, under the word primarily held for sale to customer such a thing as a dual purpose in a situation of this kind.","start":472.499,"stop":505.19,"duration":32.69},{"text":"I mean note in passing in that a respondent now concedes in his brief that there was a conflict between the Ninth and Eighth Circuits on that point.","start":505.19,"stop":515.903,"duration":10.71},{"text":"But here we have the question of the meaning that Congress had in mind in the word ‘primarily'.","start":515.903,"stop":529.306,"duration":13.4},{"text":"In the statute primarily help to sale to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business.","start":529.306,"stop":537.274,"duration":7.97},{"text":"And it's my contention that the words ‘primarily' means, what the dictionary says it means.","start":537.274,"stop":545.478,"duration":8.2},{"text":"There is not a single dictionary, and I went through 15 of them, they're all set forth in the opening brief.","start":545.478,"stop":559.283,"duration":13.81},{"text":"Not one which defines it as meaning substantial.","start":559.283,"stop":565.68,"duration":6.4},{"text":"Now, under that circumstance, there would have to be something in the statute that there was in the Agnew case which is referred to in both briefs.","start":565.68,"stop":575.602,"duration":9.92},{"text":"Something in the statute were one provision said principally and the other one said primarily to indicate that Congress possibly had in mind, some kind of a difference.","start":575.602,"stop":586,"duration":10.4},{"text":"But in this statute there is nothing that time.","start":586,"stop":588.372,"duration":2.37},{"text":"There is simply the word ‘primarily' and I think it is the law that has been recognized for all these for -- for all the way back.","start":588.372,"stop":603.855,"duration":15.48},{"text":"That when a Congress uses a term unless there is something in the statute or otherwise to require a special meaning that it means what it means in everyday usage so that the average person, the average taxpayer, I might say in this case, can know what it is that the law says.","start":603.855,"stop":629.288,"duration":25.43},{"text":"And I think and I submit that the people are entitled to know what the law says.","start":629.288,"stop":638.395,"duration":9.11},{"text":"Now, I don't doubt and the respondent has mentioned numerous cases.","start":638.395,"stop":646.472,"duration":8.08},{"text":"There are many situations where there is a rent or sale situation like in Rollingwood.","start":646.472,"stop":657.114,"duration":10.64},{"text":"The Rollingwood case in the Ninth Circuit, I think is a one of the good cases on that where property was rented with an option to the buyer to -- to purchase the property, any number of cases involving equipment sales, where it's a lease or option with an option to buy.","start":657.114,"stop":681.507,"duration":24.39},{"text":"It's one of this lease or purchase agreements.","start":681.507,"stop":684.818,"duration":3.31},{"text":"There are many of those.","start":684.818,"stop":686.376,"duration":1.56},{"text":"Now, in a situation like that, it's entirely deferent and there I believe that the Government is entitled to view the sale as being made in the ordinary course of business.","start":686.376,"stop":703.232,"duration":16.86},{"text":"In fact, the rental itself is a sort of a variant of a sale.","start":703.232,"stop":709.699,"duration":6.47},{"text":"It's -- a very much like the installment character, its part and parcel with the whole -- of the whole transaction.","start":709.699,"stop":721.363,"duration":11.66},{"text":"And the sale there is indissolubly a part of the transaction.","start":721.363,"stop":727.738,"duration":6.38},{"text":"So in that case, I think it quite proper to hold.","start":727.738,"stop":732.555,"duration":4.82},{"text":"In fact that I believe that follows the corn future case, the Corn Products case rather where the sales -- there's a course of sale which is part and parcel of the everyday operation.","start":732.555,"stop":748.052,"duration":15.5},{"text":"Now, that's an entirely different thing because there -- the sales -- the property is held primarily for sale.","start":748.052,"stop":758.56,"duration":10.51},{"text":"The sale is embedded in all the transactions and is the outcome of the transactions and the rental there is only a preliminary factor in those cases.","start":758.56,"stop":770.062,"duration":11.5},{"text":"That's an entirely different story.","start":770.062,"stop":772.279,"duration":2.22},{"text":"But here in this situation, where there was only a prospect, the possibility that eventually they might have to sell it to save themselves.","start":772.279,"stop":784.558,"duration":12.28},{"text":"That's not a holding primarily for sale.","start":784.558,"stop":787.231,"duration":2.67},{"text":"That's exact -- that District Court itself said.","start":787.231,"stop":790.948,"duration":3.72},{"text":"That was held that they would sell it off in bulks so they wouldn't get hurt.","start":790.948,"stop":799.921,"duration":8.97},{"text":"In fact, I would say that here since the whole plan was one for development as an income property and I might point out that the partnership agreement was a 30-year agreement.","start":799.921,"stop":817.803,"duration":17.88},{"text":"That in that case, the sale eventually was actually in derogation of the primary purpose and not in preference of it.","start":817.803,"stop":832.516,"duration":14.71},{"text":"Now, so that in this case on the question whether or not the property was primarily held the sale to the (Voice Overlap) this rent or sale cases have no bearing at all.","start":832.516,"stop":850.63,"duration":18.11},{"text":"Now as a final position, the Court of Appeal said that when they've got to point where the partners had a dispute and they decided to sell the property, in effect really, it was sale to two of the partners.","start":850.63,"stop":881.895,"duration":31.26},{"text":"When they got to that point, the Court of Appeals said, that the resolve to make that sale was the evidence of a purpose to hold for sale to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business.","start":881.895,"stop":899.173,"duration":17.28},{"text":"Now, on the first place, that was obviously not the ordinary course of trade or business.","start":899.173,"stop":902.965,"duration":3.79},{"text":"It was situation in which all but two partners liquidated themselves out.","start":902.965,"stop":909.833,"duration":6.87},{"text":"And in the second place, it was -- well, if there's the same it's a different view of the same thing that was really a sale to other partners.","start":909.833,"stop":918.515,"duration":8.68},{"text":"That could hardly be said to in the ordinary course of trade or business or the customers.","start":918.515,"stop":924.142,"duration":5.63}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"(Inaudible)","start":924.142,"stop":931.084,"duration":6.94}]},{"speakerName":"George T.
