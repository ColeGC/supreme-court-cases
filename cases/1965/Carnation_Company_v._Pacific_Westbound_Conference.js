Coast ports.","start":33.352,"stop":64.809,"duration":31.46},{"text":"Immediately upon the beginning of the action, the carrier-defendants and the two conferences who were made -- been made defendants, plus, the Chairman of the Westbound Conference appeared and moved to dismiss the action upon the ground that Shipping Act 1916 had, for the purposes of the action superseded the Clayton

decision.","start":135.654,"stop":140.881,"duration":5.23},{"text":"Now more particularly as to the facts and the parties; the Westbound Surface Carriers from the Pacific Coast had formed an association, Pacific Westbound Conference under Conference Agreement 57, I believe is the number, filed with the then administrating agency of the Shipping Act and approved by it.","start":140.881,"stop":168.654,"duration":27.77},{"text":"For our purposes, the principal term of that conference agreement is that the conference was made the rate-fixing agency for the carriers operating from the Pacific Coast.","start":168.654,"stop":182.901,"duration":14.25},{"text":"Also sometime before the 1950s, the carriers from the Gulf and Atlantic ports, under a conference agreement

approved.","start":182.901,"stop":206.194,"duration":23.29},{"text":"In 1952, the members of both these conferences, and incidentally these conferences are conferences of carriers which are in

are important are the first and second.","start":250.114,"stop":261.201,"duration":11.09},{"text":"They provided for a meeting and organization and, in second, particularly in second, whatever else that agreement may have provided for, it retained to each of the conferences the right of independent action with respect to the fixing of rates.","start":261.201,"stop":280.977,"duration":19.78},{"text":"In the early part of February of 1953, the members of these conferences met at Santa Barbara and organized, and eventually, as a result of that meeting and as a result of -- they held annual meetings or further meetings and in 1956, as appears in the opinion of the Federal Maritime Commission, they had arrived at agreements to this effect with respect to the fixing of rates.","start":280.977,"stop":308.135,"duration":27.16},{"text":"Certain bulk cargo was exempted from the arrangement.","start":308.135,"stop":312.069,"duration":3.93},{"text":"Certain other items of freight were placed on what was known as an initiative list for either the Pacific Westbound Conference or the Far East Conference, and that meant that those conferences, for their own members, could fix the rates without concurrence of the other conference for those items which appeared on their initiative list.","start":312.069,"stop":340.705,"duration":28.64},{"text":"It was also determined that items would not be placed upon the initiative list for either conference without the concurrence of the other.","start":340.705,"stop":351.967,"duration":11.26},{"text":"It resulted that from 1956-on, an item could not be put on the initiative list without concurrence of both conferences.","start":351.967,"stop":363.278,"duration":11.31},{"text":"Secondly, the rates for an item which was not on the initiative list could not be fixed by any one of the two rate-making conferences for its own members without the concurrence of the other conference.","start":363.278,"stop":377.852,"duration":14.57},{"text":"Evaporated milk was not on the initiative list.","start":377.852,"stop":382.931,"duration":5.08},{"text":"In 1957, effective as of May 1, 1957, the then existing rates of evaporated milk from Pacific Coast ports to the Far East theretofore properly fixed by Pacific Westbound Conference for its own members was raised by $2.50 a ton.","start":382.931,"stop":406.144,"duration":23.21},{"text":"Later on that year, this petitioner applied to Pacific Westbound Conference to reduce that rate by $2.50 a ton and return it to the rate that it theretofore been fixed.","start":406.144,"stop":419.783,"duration":13.64},{"text":"In February of the next year, Pacific Westbound Conference determined for itself that such a reduction was in order and applied to Far East Conference for concurrence.","start":419.783,"stop":433.562,"duration":13.78},{"text":"Concurrence was denied.","start":433.562,"stop":436.383,"duration":2.82},{"text":"Thereupon, Pacific Westbound Conference withdrew its request and the increased rate remained in effect until 1962.","start":436.383,"stop":446.316,"duration":9.93},{"text":"At a later time, the Federal Maritime Commission undertook an investigation which had, for its purposes, it's on its own motion, two matters; one, to determine whether this filed Agreement 8200, under which the two conferences were purporting to Act, represented the full agreement of the parties and, secondly, to determine the order being in effect in language of Section 15 of the Shipping Act, whether or not it was of such character that it should remain
