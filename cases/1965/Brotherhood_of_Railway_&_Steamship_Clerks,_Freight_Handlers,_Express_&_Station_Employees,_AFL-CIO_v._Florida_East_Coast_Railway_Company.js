one.","start":129.215,"stop":132.168,"duration":2.95},{"text":"The question is where and to what extent carriers covered by the Railway Labor Act must obey first their duty to bargain with the representatives of their employees and secondly, their duty to adhere to existing collective bargaining agreements which they have previously made with those representatives.","start":132.168,"stop":152.313,"duration":20.14},{"text":"During the course of a lawful strike, the Unites States takes the position that both of those duties remain upon the carrier during the course of a lawful strike.","start":152.313,"stop":163.52,"duration":11.21},{"text":"It must both bargain with the representatives of its employees and it must adhere to collective bargaining agreements which continue to exist during the course of that strike.","start":163.52,"stop":173.47,"duration":9.95},{"text":"The carrier, on the other hand, takes the position that it is under neither those, that it must neither bargain nor adhere to existing collective bargaining agreements.","start":173.47,"stop":183.81,"duration":10.34},{"text":"Let me briefly sketch to the Court the statutory scheme which maybe somewhat unfamiliar under which these issues arise.","start":183.81,"stop":192.332,"duration":8.52},{"text":"In the first place, like the National Labor Relations Act, the Railway Labor Act contains a general duty to bargain between employers and the representatives of their employees.","start":192.332,"stop":202.227,"duration":9.9},{"text":"It goes a little bit further in general than the Railway -- than the National Labors Relations Act, however, in providing rather affirmatively that there's a duty of all carriers to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay rules and working conditions and to settle all disputes arising out of those agreements with the representatives of their employee.","start":202.227,"stop":224.938,"duration":22.71},{"text":"There's nothing like that that explicit in the National Labors Relations Act about the duty to make and maintain agreements and of course a continuing duty to bargain with the representatives.","start":224.938,"stop":235.357,"duration":10.42},{"text":"Then the Act becomes much more explicit than the National Labors Relations Act and much more absolute in describing the meaning of the duty to bargain, “once agreements have been reached with the representatives of employees, as agreements had been reached in this case, first the Act provides that when either the carrier or the union wishes to change existing agreements covering rates of pay rules or working conditions notice must be served on the other party and negotiations between the parties undertaken.","start":235.357,"stop":271.007,"duration":35.65},{"text":"If these negotiations fail to result in agreements either party may then invoke the services of the National Mediation Board which is created primarily for that purpose, to mediate disputes which haven't been settled by a negotiation or the Mediation Board may itself proffer its services even if the parties don't ask it to.","start":271.007,"stop":289.853,"duration":18.85},{"text":"If this mediation fails, the Board, the Mediation Board, is then directed to encourage the parties to submit to the dispute to binding arbitration, although it can't compel the parties to do so.”","start":289.853,"stop":301.754,"duration":11.9},{"text":"If one or both of the parties refuses arbitration and there's another step, the last resort you can create a presidential commission, an Emergency Board it's called, to recommend the solution to the dispute and again its recommendations aren't binding.","start":301.754,"stop":317.094,"duration":15.34},{"text":"And --","start":317.094,"stop":317.427,"duration":0.33}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"And the discretion of the president is not --","start":317.427,"stop":319.206,"duration":1.78}]},{"speakerName":"Paul Bender","textObjs":[{"text":"Right.","start":319.206,"stop":320.347,"duration":1.14},{"text":"I think the Mediation Board has some rule in making recommendations for the President but of course the President does not have to appoint the Board.","start":320.347,"stop":327.427,"duration":7.08},{"text":"In thus providing these detailed procedures which don't have any direct parallel in National Labors Relations Act, the Act provides as explicitly as one can imagine that existing conditions, those subject to the dispute, those that one party or the other wants to change must not be changed by the carrier while these negotiations, the mediation, the arbitration or if there's an Emergency Board, the Emergency Board is acting, while these procedures are in progress, you may not change the existing conditions.","start":327.427,"stop":358.744,"duration":31.32},{"text":"Then there's a general provision which again provides as explicitly as you can imagine, that you cannot make changes without entering into these statutory procedures.","start":358.744,"stop":368.618,"duration":9.87},{"text":"That provision, Section 2 Seventh of the Act, provides that unless the statutory from the negotiation procedures are undertaken, no carrier, its officers, agents or agent shall change the rates of pay, rules or working conditions of it's employees as a class as embodied in agreements.","start":368.618,"stop":386.807,"duration":18.19},{"text":"Thus, it seems to us quite clear and I don't think anyone disagrees with this, that the duty to bargain under the Railway Labor Act is defined in part and perhaps its most essential part, as the duty to adhere to existing collective bargaining agreements and not to change those agreements for employees as a class not the institute what would amount to amendments or changes without bargaining with the representatives of the employees.","start":386.807,"stop":413.86,"duration":27.05},{"text":"At the same time as the carrier thus found there is a similar rule that applies to unions requiring the maintenance of existing agreements while these statutory procedures are in progress.","start":413.86,"stop":425.445,"duration":11.58},{"text":"Thus, when a union for example is engaged in a wage dispute with a carrier, it may not strike on to and I think everyone agrees with this, although this is not as explicit in the Act, it may not strike until it has exhausted the statutory procedures just as the carrier may not unilaterally change the wages until it's exhausted the procedures are the carrier can engage in a lockout until the procedures have been exhausted.","start":425.445,"stop":448.075,"duration":22.63},{"text":"When the procedures are exhausted without a solution being reached, then and only then may the union strike to achieve its aims of proposal, and then and only then may the carrier implement the changes which it proposes without first exhausting the statutory procedures, both parties have to stand by existing agreements.","start":448.075,"stop":467.156,"duration":19.08},{"text":"That's what the Act provides and I can imagine that it could do so anymore clearly.","start":467.156,"stop":471.531,"duration":4.38},{"text":"Now, it's -- as I said I think it's conceded that those provisions as I've described them are applicable in the ordinary situation.","start":471.531,"stop":480.877,"duration":9.35},{"text":"The question here is, and also let me put that they are enforceable by injunction.","start":480.877,"stop":489.872,"duration":9},{"text":"I don't think there's any dispute about that any longer.","start":489.872,"stop":492.237,"duration":2.37},{"text":"There once was a question whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act might have prevented either of the parties from enjoining the other party.","start":492.237,"stop":497.652,"duration":5.41},{"text":"That is no longer a question seriously open to dispute.","start":497.652,"stop":501.612,"duration":3.96},{"text":"The question in this case is whether that statutory scheme as I described, it remains applicable during a lawful strike.","start":501.612,"stop":510.249,"duration":8.64},{"text":"The carrier argues that those provisions do not.","start":510.249,"stop":513.701,"duration":3.45},{"text":"In its view, when a strike occurs even though it's a lawful strike, it is entirely free, completely free to implement whatever wages, work rules or working conditions it desires for as long as the strike continues.","start":513.701,"stop":528.819,"duration":15.12},{"text":"And that it doesn't have to bargain with the union about the implementation of any of those procedures either before the strike or during the strike.","start":528.819,"stop":537.294,"duration":8.48},{"text":"As far as it's our concerned, the strike uses a complete freedom to treat its employees as it wishes so long as the strike continues and it carriers and I quote from it's brief, it says “It's agreements with the labor organizations were suspended during the period of the strike and FEC was not required even to attempt to comply with.”","start":537.294,"stop":558.454,"duration":21.16}]},{"speakerName":"William J.
