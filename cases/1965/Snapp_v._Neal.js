definition said that it was a vehicle either automated by its own power or drawn by the power except human power, so that a house trailer was within the 1958 Motor Vehicle Act, but Mississippi in 1962 elected to pass another statute which says that house trailers shall be taxed and that there shall be a registration fee of $2.50 which registration fee cannot be obtained and which registration

some doubt about the question illustrates again the congressional intent to add liberality towards the servicemen because there they used the situs
