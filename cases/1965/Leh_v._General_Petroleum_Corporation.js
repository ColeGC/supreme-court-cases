the conduct challenged by the plaintiff was complained of in the government action and referred to the overt acts challenged by the plaintiff and contrast them with the overt acts or conduct complained of by the Government in the following particulars.","start":76.317,"stop":101.906,"duration":25.59},{"text":"In the plaintiffs' complaint, we alleged overt acts consisting of, among others, controlling the sale and distribution of refined gasoline in the Southern California area, denying independent jobbers access to a source of supply of refined gasoline, preventing independent jobbers from obtaining refined gasoline from other sources.","start":101.906,"stop":124.551,"duration":22.64},{"text":"The government complaint, on the other hand, at paragraphs 70 (b) (6), (7), (8), (10), (11), (12), and (15), charges the defendants there named with foreclosing independent wholesale and retail markets otherwise available to independent refiners by requiring independent jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers to handle exclusively the refined petroleum products of the defendant majors.","start":124.551,"stop":154.067,"duration":29.52},{"text":"Again, the plaintiffs' complaint states as an overt act that the defendants prevented the customers of independent jobbers to retailers from obtaining gasoline with which to compete with retail service stations and outlets operated or controlled by the defendants there named.","start":154.067,"stop":175.302,"duration":21.23},{"text":"The government complaint, on the other hand, charges the defendants there named with maintaining agreed upon wholesale and retail prices by refusing to sell gasoline to any wholesale or retail distributors who refuse to follow the prices fixed and by adopting the uniformed policy of refusing to sell gasoline to any wholesale distributor, jobber, or retail dealer who would not agree to sell the products of a single dependent major on an exclusive dealing basis.","start":175.302,"stop":204.818,"duration":29.52},{"text":"Again, the plaintiffs' complaint charges the defendants with maintaining fixed artificial and uncompetitive prices for the wholesale and retail sale of refined gasoline in the Southern California area.","start":204.818,"stop":216.227,"duration":11.41},{"text":"The government complaint charges the defendants there named in almost identical language with fixing and maintaining uniform and noncompetitive resale prices to the charged consumers by retailers handling gasoline.","start":216.227,"stop":230.073,"duration":13.85},{"text":"The plaintiffs charge as an overt act that the defendants destroyed any substantial competition afforded them in the wholesale and retail selling and marketing of refined gasoline in the Southern California area.","start":230.073,"stop":245.517,"duration":15.44},{"text":"The government complaint charges the defendants with sharing wholesale and retail markets in the sale of gasoline by standardizing the various grades, qualities, and structure of gasoline and by selling gasoline and other refined products at identical prices.","start":245.517,"stop":260.757,"duration":15.24},{"text":"The plaintiffs' complaint in the private case charges the defendants as an overt act with controlling the sources of refined gasoline in the Southern California area, and preventing and precluding independent jobbers from obtaining source and supply.","start":260.757,"stop":275.765,"duration":15.01},{"text":"The government complaint, on the other hand, charges the defendants with fixing and maintaining uniform and noncompetitive prices for the sale of gasoline by causing the posting of an agreed price for each type and grade of gasoline at wholesale distribution points and by causing each other to post and charge identical prices at such points.","start":275.765,"stop":294.718,"duration":18.95},{"text":"Now, from a comparison of those overt acts alleged by the plaintiff in the private case with the comparison of the charges by the Government in the government case, it is submitted that the test of this Court in Minnesota Mining, to with, was the conduct challenged by the plaintiff complained of in the government action, is more than satisfied.","start":294.718,"stop":320.05,"duration":25.33},{"text":"However, the respondents in this case address themselves to three distinctions which they urge differentiate that conduct which has just been compared.","start":320.05,"stop":334.835,"duration":14.78},{"text":"Distinction number one is that the complaint in the government case charges a conspiracy commencing in or about the year 1936, whereas, the complaint in the private case charges a conspiracy commencing in or about the year 1948.","start":334.835,"stop":356.802,"duration":21.97},{"text":"Now, again, in addressing myself to this distinction, I do so by asking, “Is the Government complaining of conduct in 1936 or is the Government complaining of conduct at all times and including 1948 and right up until, and including 1950, the time of filing of the government antitrust action?”","start":356.802,"stop":383.838,"duration":27.04},{"text":"In my references, I will refer to the appendix filed by respondents of the government complaint since it's -- since it's in a brief form rather than the typewritten record on which this case is being presented.","start":383.838,"stop":395.223,"duration":11.38},{"text":"In answer to that question of 1936 versus 1948 and what the government was complaining about when it filed its complaint in 1950, I refer first to the appendix at page 40, which takes up at that point at paragraph number 21 of the government complaint.","start":395.223,"stop":416.164,"duration":20.94},{"text":"At that point, the Government, in its complaint, points out that the Conservation Committee of California Oil Producers had its inception in 1930 but that the present committee was organized in 1936 and goes on to state, in effect, its formation constituted merely a reorganization of predecessor organizations.","start":416.164,"stop":439.539,"duration":23.38},{"text":"So that, the 1936 date used in the government complaint, I submit, is clarified as the date upon which the Conservation Committee of Oil Producers was reorganized.","start":439.539,"stop":452.545,"duration":13.01},{"text":"At page 49 and 50 of the appendix, commencing at numbered paragraphs 46 of the government complaint, it is to be emphasized, that in describing the commerce and trade affected, the government is not talking about something that happened in 1936 as a static and frozen thing.","start":452.545,"stop":476.247,"duration":23.7},{"text":"The Government says, as of January 1, 1949, there were approximately 64 crude oil refineries.","start":476.247,"stop":483.259,"duration":7.01},{"text":"Their complying crude oil import -- input was so many barrels per day.","start":483.259,"stop":488.234,"duration":4.97},{"text":"Again, further on that, as of January 1, 1949, there were so many barrels refined from the refineries that were opened and 17 refineries were, at that point, idle.","start":488.234,"stop":501.355,"duration":13.12},{"text":"At pages 52 and -- at page 50, rather, numbered paragraph 50, during 1948 the total gasoline produced by refiners in the Pacific States area was approximately 120 million barrels, at which defendant majors produced and sold approximately 108 million barrels for approximately 90%.","start":501.355,"stop":523.075,"duration":21.72},{"text":"At pages 52 and 55 of the appendix, numbered paragraph 56, the Government, in concluding the description of the trade and commerce affected, uses these very significant paragraphs.","start":523.075,"stop":537.473,"duration":14.4},{"text":"And it is to be emphasized that it was emphasized by this Court in the Minnesota Mining case where the Court might recall there was an argument made that the Federal Trade Commission, in that case, was put to a burden only of showing a possible effect on competition, whereas, the plaintiff was put to the burden of showing an actual effect on competition.","start":537.473,"stop":559.875,"duration":22.4},{"text":"And, the Court pointed out as a significant factor that the Federal Trade Commission had alleged both in terms of possible and positive effect that is that there could be restraint and that there was a restraint.","start":559.875,"stop":570.926,"duration":11.05},{"text":"So, also, the Government in this case alleges speaking in the present tense, not about 1936.","start":570.926,"stop":578.262,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Each defendant major requires independent distributors who handled its refined petroleum products to deal exclusively in the refined petroleum products of said defendant major, and to refrain from dealing in the petroleum products of independent refiners and marketers.","start":578.262,"stop":592.5,"duration":14.24},{"text":"Each defendant major also requires the independent distributors handling its refined petroleum products to sell said products to retail dealers and to large consumers at prices fixed by defendant majors, and otherwise, to conduct their business in the manner desired by defendant majors.","start":592.5,"stop":609.993,"duration":17.49},{"text":"At page 55, each of the defendant majors -- this is numbered paragraph 62, each of the defendant majors requires the independent operators who sell its refined petroleum products to purchase the requirements exclusively from the respective defendant major and not to handle or sell the petroleum products of others.","start":609.993,"stop":630.037,"duration":20.04},{"text":"At page 58, at the top of the page, except for the area within a three-mile radius of Los Angeles Harbor, defendant majors enjoy, in the present tense, a virtual monopoly in the wholesale and retail sale of gasoline and other refined petroleum products manufactured and sold in the Pacific States area.","start":630.037,"stop":649.842,"duration":19.8},{"text":"Now, Mr. Kirkham will undoubtedly say that I have quoted up to that point from numbered paragraph 4 of the government complaint which describes the trade and commerce affected.","start":649.842,"stop":660.308,"duration":10.47},{"text":"However, I submit that is relevant in determining whether the Government is there talking about 1936, 1948, or 1950, or a combination in a continuing thing going up until June of 1950 and thereafter which they were trying in 1950 to prevent.","start":660.308,"stop":677.918,"duration":17.61},{"text":"However, commencing with paragraph V, charging the actual offenses set down by the Government at page 58, numbered paragraph 69, the actual language used by the Government is the following, “beginning in or about the year 1936 and continuing thereafter up to and including the date of filing the complaint, the defendants have been and now are engaged in a combination and conspiracy to restrain unreasonably,” etcetera.","start":677.918,"stop":712.058,"duration":34.14},{"text":"In numbered paragraph 70, “the actual monopolizations have consisted of continuing agreement and concert of action among the defendants, its potential terms of which have been,” etcetera.","start":712.058,"stop":726.514,"duration":14.46},{"text":"And, again -- and, finally, at page 66, “in concluding immediately before the prayer, the Government accuses the defendants of controlling completely the competition of independent producers, retailers and marketers.”","start":726.514,"stop":745.19,"duration":18.68},{"text":"And you'll recall that in the brief in opposition in this case, the respondents have said that they wish to ignore everything but the marketing aspect.","start":745.19,"stop":752.707,"duration":7.52},{"text":"Of course, the Government was concerned with all phases, and I will advert to that shortly.","start":752.707,"stop":758.928,"duration":6.22},{"text":"But, the Government specifically accuses the defendants of controlling completely the competition of producers, refiners, and marketers.","start":758.928,"stop":766.634,"duration":7.71},{"text":"The defendant majors' quadruple monopoly of the production, transportation, refining, and marketing of crude oil and refined petroleum products “has stabilized completely the entire oil industry in the Pacific States area and has resulted in the elimination of all price competition in the sale to consumers of gasoline and other refined petroleum products.","start":766.634,"stop":790.252,"duration":23.62},{"text":"Now, it is submitted, therefore, that Government was concerned with a conspiracy which was in existence at least from 1936 and probably earlier than 1936 date being selected because of the reorganization on that date of the Conservation Committee of California Oil Producers, and was concerned with conduct which was continuing in 1948, 1949, and 1950.","start":790.252,"stop":820.65,"duration":30.4},{"text":"And that, therefore, with in the test laid down by the Minnesota Mining case of whether the Government was complaining of conduct complained of in the plaintiffs' complaint, the plaintiffs submit that it was.","start":820.65,"stop":834.733,"duration":14.08},{"text":"As stated by the Court in Philco versus R.C.A, cited in the brief, we see nothing novel in stating a conspiracy within a conspiracy.","start":834.733,"stop":847.203,"duration":12.47},{"text":"And, indeed, that would seem to be the normal situation in the private antitrust case.","start":847.203,"stop":853.874,"duration":6.67},{"text":"In other words, the Government is concerned with conspiracy in a grand manner on a grand scale covering perhaps the nation or in this case, the five western states.","start":853.874,"stop":866.974,"duration":13.1},{"text":"The impact of that conspiracy on a local level is what the individual private litigant is concerned with, and it has been referred to several times in this term of conspiracy within a conspiracy or a smaller conspiracy within the large, and seems to be the typical

Nisley.","start":1057.371,"stop":1079.244,"duration":21.87},{"text":"Now, the Tenth Circuit and Eighth Circuit agreed with that

locality.","start":1130.213,"stop":1148.941,"duration":18.73},{"text":"Now, the Tenth and Eight Circuits took exactly the contra view of that particular proposition and said that it was admissible to
