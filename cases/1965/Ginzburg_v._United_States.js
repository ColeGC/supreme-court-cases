the Government agree that in order for a work to be obscene it must be without redeeming social importance, it must make its predominant appeal to prurient interest, and it must be patently offense.","start":97.248,"stop":114.957,"duration":17.71},{"text":"We say that none of the elements that identify obscenity are present in any of the publications in this

coalesce in a single work in order for it to be proscribable obscenity.","start":135.06,"stop":143.014,"duration":7.95},{"text":"As to the element of redeeming social importance, the court below, the trial court found as did the Courts of Appeal -- Court of Appeals that none of these publications had the slightest social value, had any redeeming social importance, whatever.","start":143.014,"stop":161.858,"duration":18.84},{"text":"Here in this Court, the Government does not defend those findings.","start":161.858,"stop":166.944,"duration":5.09},{"text":"It

report of the interview with the well-known psychologist, Dr. Albert Ellis constitutes serious and protected advocacy.","start":173.298,"stop":190.855,"duration":17.56},{"text":"And so rather than ask this Court to conclude that these works are without redeeming social importance when considered as a whole, the Government asked the Court to dissect these two publications, article by article and consider each article as if it might be an independent obscene work.","start":190.855,"stop":218.023,"duration":27.17},{"text":"In this case, the door was closed to that approach before the trial even begun.","start":218.023,"stop":224.777,"duration":6.75},{"text":"Petitioners asked for a bill of particulars in which the Government would be requested to state whether the indictment charge that the alleged nonmailable material was obscene when considered as a whole, or if it not whether part or parts of them were alleged to be obscene and if so, to state which parts.","start":224.777,"stop":248.582,"duration":23.81},{"text":"Now, in lieu of the bill of particulars, the Government stipulated that the indictment charges that each of the alleged nonmailable material is obscene when considered as a whole.","start":248.582,"stop":263.71,"duration":15.13},{"text":"And when we consider EROS and Liaison as a whole, we think it clear that they do have redeeming social importance and so as to those publications, this element is simply not present.","start":263.71,"stop":278.206,"duration":14.5},{"text":"With respect to the third work, the Housewife's Handbook on selective promiscuity, here too the Government says that the lack of redeeming importance in this work maybe open to question and that the entire issue of its obscenity is a matter of legitimate debate, that's the position they assert here.","start":278.206,"stop":299.36,"duration":21.15},{"text":"The claims for redeeming social importance of the Handbook were three.","start":299.36,"stop":305.058,"duration":5.7},{"text":"First, as a true author biographical account of a woman sexually experienced as in attitudes, it provided needed information.","start":305.058,"stop":316.939,"duration":11.88},{"text":"Secondly, it had been found useful or reading of the work had been found useful to some people particularly women whose normal sexual drives beset them with feelings of guilt and anxiety.","start":316.939,"stop":331.959,"duration":15.02},{"text":"Here, was another woman talking to them and saying, ?This is the way I feel.","start":331.959,"stop":336.632,"duration":4.67},{"text":"You are not alone in this world.","start":336.632,"stop":338.566,"duration":1.93},{"text":"You need not live solely within the confines of your own mind.?","start":338.566,"stop":343.568,"duration":5},{"text":"Third, the Handbook has much social commentary and advocate, seriously advocates the reshaping of society's view of the sexual role of women.","start":343.568,"stop":359.328,"duration":15.76},{"text":"The Government says that the Handbook may have the values claimed for it.","start":359.328,"stop":365.703,"duration":6.38},{"text":"If it has such values, we recognize that it comes within the protection of the First Amendment, so says the Government, but they had a restriction here.","start":365.703,"stop":377.396,"duration":11.69},{"text":"They say so long as the distribution of the book reflects these social values which are claimed for it.","start":377.396,"stop":387.068,"duration":9.67},{"text":"Now, this restriction, this appendage to redeeming social importance that the Government adds at this particular point of the litigation, when one thinks about it, I think it's really quite frightening.","start":387.068,"stop":399.856,"duration":12.79},{"text":"What the Government is saying is that we can take a work with redeeming social importance and that Government may determine by occupational and educational qualification who maybe permitted to read this work and who may not be permitted to read it.","start":399.856,"stop":420.319,"duration":20.46},{"text":"If there were such a statute and it contained the authority for such of a classification, we think at the very least, it would raise grave constitutional doubts.","start":420.319,"stop":429.691,"duration":9.37},{"text":"But this statute is not such a statute.","start":429.691,"stop":434.315,"duration":4.62},{"text":"It looks entirely to the material mail and it focuses neither on the motives of the mailer nor on the academic credentials of the addressee.","start":434.315,"stop":445.994,"duration":11.68},{"text":"There are some other problems with the Government's suggestion, one of them shows what The Eleventh Hour suggestion it happens to be.","start":445.994,"stop":453.049,"duration":7.05},{"text":"This record is absolutely silent as to the distribution that petitioner gave by Handbook.","start":453.049,"stop":459.123,"duration":6.07},{"text":"All it shows is that 5000 copies of the book were mailed.","start":459.123,"stop":464.936,"duration":5.81},{"text":"But it really doesn't matter because the values claimed for the Handbook were not solely for the clinician or the educator or the professional, those people whom the Government would say are permitted to read this work, therefore other people will be sized.","start":464.936,"stop":483.837,"duration":18.9},{"text":"And as far as the Handbook Social Advocacy is concerned, it isn't even directed to those classes of people.","start":483.837,"stop":491.148,"duration":7.31},{"text":"It's directed to the public at large.","start":491.148,"stop":496.916,"duration":5.77},{"text":"And so this suggestion by the Government, the suggestion for an additional restriction on redeeming social importance is without support on this record is inapplicable to the values claimed for the Handbook, has nothing to do with this statute and is most probably unconstitutional as well.","start":496.916,"stop":520.518,"duration":23.6},{"text":"The Government does agree, leaving that question aside, that if a work has redeeming social importance it is protected by the First Amendment regardless of whether the other elements which identify obscenity maybe present in that work.","start":520.518,"stop":540.237,"duration":19.72},{"text":"The Government does add that a claim for redeeming social importance -- that redeeming social importance will not be established on the basis of a single well-termed phrase or one or two photographs of artistic merit.","start":540.237,"stop":554.306,"duration":14.07},{"text":"But we agree with the Government on that but that's got nothing to do with this case and the Government doesn't claim that it does.","start":554.306,"stop":561.354,"duration":7.05},{"text":"What does have much to do with this case is the Government's agreement that once you find redeeming social importance, that is the end of the inquiry.","start":561.354,"stop":573.696,"duration":12.34},{"text":"The amicus -- Citizens for Decent Literature feels differently about this.","start":573.696,"stop":578.633,"duration":4.94},{"text":"I'd like to refer to their brief for a moment.","start":578.633,"stop":581.755,"duration":3.12},{"text":"They urge this Court to adopt a balancing test under which -- works' affirmative values would be measured against its patent defensiveness or prurient appeal and that from this balance in someway we would strike a judgment as to whether or not the works were obscene.","start":581.755,"stop":603.165,"duration":21.41},{"text":"This test that the civil -- Citizens for Decent Literature urges the Court to adopt, flies in the face of this Court's holding in Roth where it was held that the -- obscenity statutes cannot be used to suppress that which has redeeming social importance and consider the practical consequences of this for a moment.","start":603.165,"stop":624.875,"duration":21.71},{"text":"A publisher given a manuscript dealing with sexual matters would have to examine that manuscript, would have to ascertain how much if it constitutes the advocacy of an idea, would then have to waive the relative merit of that idea and having done so would then have to look and see, \"Well, how much prurient interest is there and how much patent offensiveness is there in this work?\"","start":624.875,"stop":649.393,"duration":24.52},{"text":"And he would have to make a self-employed balancing

the work makes a serious claim to redeeming social importance, that work is protected by the First Amendment.","start":660.79,"stop":669.448,"duration":8.66},{"text":"And that's -- really is the end of the inquiry and so the Government agrees with this.","start":669.448,"stop":674.787,"duration":5.34},{"text":"But if the publisher is required to make these judgments to weigh the affirmative values against everything else and match that judgment against that of every prosecutor in the United States, this would not only have a chilling effect upon the exercise of First Amendment rights.","start":674.787,"stop":694.395,"duration":19.61},{"text":"I think it would put all such publications in a deep freeze.","start":694.395,"stop":700.827,"duration":6.43},{"text":"It would also create an insurmountable vagueness problem.","start":700.827,"stop":706.398,"duration":5.57},{"text":"Hairline precision is not possible in this case.","start":706.398,"stop":709.156,"duration":2.76},{"text":"This Court has said so time and time again.","start":709.156,"stop":712.03,"duration":2.87},{"text":"Everybody recognizes that there were difficulties inherent in applying these statutes with hairline precision.","start":712.03,"stop":719.999,"duration":7.97},{"text":"These difficulties normally arise in the prurient interest and patent offensiveness in these areas.","start":719.999,"stop":726.047,"duration":6.05},{"text":"But we certainly don't need to make the test any less precise or any more subjective and this is precisely what the CDL was urging the course -- the Court to do.","start":726.047,"stop":743.044,"duration":17},{"text":"Now, the Government agrees that this Court must exercise an independent judgment as to matters of redeeming social importance.","start":743.044,"stop":752.702,"duration":9.66},{"text":"No question about that.","start":752.702,"stop":754.974,"duration":2.27},{"text":"This Court will make its own judgment on that.","start":754.974,"stop":757.891,"duration":2.92},{"text":"But as to prurient interest appeal and patent offensiveness, it urges the Court to rely upon the findings of the trial court.","start":757.891,"stop":769.364,"duration":11.47},{"text":"This Court of course does not ordinarily need questions of constitutional classification of the First Amendment area to the judgments of others.","start":769.364,"stop":779.674,"duration":10.31},{"text":"And even if it were inclined to rely on these findings, these findings don't even support the judgments of conviction as to EROS and Liaison where one of the elements of obscenity is missing as to each of these publications.","start":779.674,"stop":796.398,"duration":16.72},{"text":"These findings, in addition, can have no deference paid to them because of the manner in which they were made.","start":796.398,"stop":804.7,"duration":8.3},{"text":"These are purportedly findings made pursuant to Rule 23 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.","start":804.7,"stop":813.17,"duration":8.47},{"text":"That rule provides that in a case tried without a jury, the Court shall make a general finding and shall in addition on request find the facts especially.","start":813.17,"stop":826.988,"duration":13.82},{"text":"The trial court has given no discretion to deny the request.","start":826.988,"stop":830.514,"duration":3.53},{"text":"If it's made, these findings must be issued.","start":830.514,"stop":835.059,"duration":4.54},{"text":"The request was made in this case the day before the trial concluded.","start":835.059,"stop":840.376,"duration":5.32},{"text":"The following day, the judge -- trial judge pronounced petitioner is guilty as to all counts of the indictment and directed the prosecutor to prepare the findings in support of that judgment of conviction.","start":840.376,"stop":857.487,"duration":17.11},{"text":"Sometime thereafter, we don't know when, the prosecutor having prepared proposed findings submitted them to the trial judge in the form of an ex parte off the record communication.And 54 days after they adjudged petitioners guilty, the trial judge handed down these so-called special findings.","start":857.487,"stop":882.791,"duration":25.3},{"text":"Even if these were an ordinary criminal case rather than a case involving the exercise of First Amendment rights requiring scrupulous adherence to procedures, the manner in which the findings were made here we think would compel reversal of the judgment as an independent consideration.","start":882.791,"stop":905.386,"duration":22.59},{"text":"But aside from that certainly no deference can be made to these
