of New Jersey which denied a petition for post-conviction relief.","start":29.431,"stop":41.826,"duration":12.4},{"text":"The -- there was a murder, a homicide at 6:10 p.m. on a Friday evening, January 24th, 1958.","start":41.826,"stop":54.396,"duration":12.57},{"text":"At 1:30 p.m. the following Tuesday, a defendant by the name of Godfrey was arrested in the company of someone else.","start":54.396,"stop":64.281,"duration":9.89},{"text":"The petitioner Cassidy was not arrested until 4 a.m. in the morning, Wednesday morning, after the homicide January 29th and petitioner Johnson was not arrested until 5 p.m.that evening, Wednesday evening, the 29th of January.","start":64.281,"stop":83.376,"duration":19.1},{"text":"After the arrests of these three individuals during those two days, the three of them gave a total of six statements, incriminating statements.","start":83.376,"stop":96.091,"duration":12.71},{"text":"From the time each of them were arrested, they were in the complete custody of the police and they were in custody for quite sometime as will developed during the course of the arguments.","start":96.091,"stop":111.783,"duration":15.69},{"text":"Now, it is our position that the argument here falls into three major categories of arguments.","start":111.783,"stop":119.726,"duration":7.94},{"text":"First of all, we are suggesting that the means of eliciting these confessions and using them at the time of their trial, during the time when they were not advised of their right to counsel, they were not advised of their right to remain silent and to make no statements.","start":119.726,"stop":141.545,"duration":21.82},{"text":"They were not permitted to see family.","start":141.545,"stop":146.328,"duration":4.78},{"text":"They were not proceeded -- permitted to see counsel even though they requested it.","start":146.328,"stop":152.195,"duration":5.87},{"text":"They were held for several days without a preliminary hearing.","start":152.195,"stop":158.503,"duration":6.31},{"text":"Although, I will put note that to say that one of the petitioners was given a form of a hearing, he was arrested not at the scene of the crime where they were ultimately tried in Camden.","start":158.503,"stop":170.127,"duration":11.62},{"text":"But he was arrested in Newark and there was a form of a preliminary hearing during which apparently the only thing that happened was a transfer of custody from the Newark police to the Camden police.","start":170.127,"stop":183.501,"duration":13.37},{"text":"Nothing in the record shows us exactly what took place there, although, we do have an affidavit of that petitioner that he was not advised of any rights or told of his right to counsel at that time.","start":183.501,"stop":194.851,"duration":11.35}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Is there a coerced confession claim in this case?","start":194.851,"stop":197.206,"duration":2.35}]},{"speakerName":"Stanford Shmukler","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, sir, there is.","start":197.206,"stop":198.229,"duration":1.02},{"text":"There is in two respects.","start":198.229,"stop":201.943,"duration":3.71},{"text":"First of all, we feel that the totally of the circumstances here under which they were illegally detained, they were held incommunicado.","start":201.943,"stop":211.51,"duration":9.57},{"text":"They were not told of their right to remain silent.","start":211.51,"stop":214.574,"duration":3.06},{"text":"They were confronted with the confessions of the other defendant who late -- which later were held to be coerced by the Third Circuit that the totally of all these circumstances show that these people were overborne.","start":214.574,"stop":230.686,"duration":16.11},{"text":"And we also wish to urge that the interpretation of the Escobedo case which we feel means if the Six Amendment is giving effect to the Fifth Amendments shows that the absence of counsel here and the absence of an advice of their right to counsel deprive them of the one feature which is essential on all confession cases, the right to make a free choice.","start":230.686,"stop":261.784,"duration":31.1},{"text":"They did not have the right to make a free choice because they were not in possession of the facts necessary to make a free choice.","start":261.784,"stop":271.269,"duration":9.49},{"text":"We have another line of arguments here which does not involve the Escobedo interpretation.","start":271.269,"stop":280.627,"duration":9.36},{"text":"And that is that these individuals who sought separate trials, who sought to have their cases severed and who sought during the course of the joint trial after they were refused separate trials, the use of this cross-implicating confessions against each other deprived them of a fair trial.","start":280.627,"stop":301.831,"duration":21.2},{"text":"In the sense of the Aranda decision in California and as now seems to be the practice announced in a New York and a New Jersey case, Young case which is cite in our brief.","start":301.831,"stop":315.613,"duration":13.78},{"text":"And lastly, the inflammatory comments and summation by the prosecutor deprived them of a fair trial.","start":315.613,"stop":326.203,"duration":10.59},{"text":"Now, I might state that there were two other issues which were raised in our petition for certiorari which have been rendered both by decisions of this Court.","start":326.203,"stop":334.977,"duration":8.77},{"text":"One issue concerned the use of a gun which we claim was obtained from them under a promise which was not kept and we recognize that the Linkletter case renders this argument moot.","start":334.977,"stop":348.334,"duration":13.36},{"text":"Likewise, we raise the question that the prosecutor's comment on their failure to testify supported by the court's charge on that point violated the Malloy and Griffin cases.","start":348.334,"stop":366.1,"duration":17.77},{"text":"However, this Court in deciding Kean has certainly mooted that point insofar as we talk about the retroactivity of the Malloy and Griffin points.","start":366.1,"stop":376.598,"duration":10.5},{"text":"As we pointed out in our reply brief which is I assumed in -- I distribute to the Court although it was printed rather late, we were unable, the Court printed it and I think it was distributed.","start":376.598,"stop":389.731,"duration":13.13},{"text":"We do not give up the argument which we'd made in the principal brief that the prosecutor's comments on the failure testify, also affected or taken in totality of the circumstances of his entirely inflammatory summation suggested inferences which were not supported by any facts and that those comments taken along with the others violated in -- violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights not the Fifth Amendment right as we -- as had originally been suggested in connection with the Griffin and Malloy.","start":389.731,"stop":428.026,"duration":38.3},{"text":"Now, addressing myself to the question of the means of eliciting and using these confessions, these -- first of all, the background on these individuals we think is relevant here to show the need for counsel at this stage which certainly, if we have to give the label was passed the accusatory stage because when the first of these petitioners was arrested, Cassidy, he had already been apparently identified by the other people who had been arrested.","start":428.026,"stop":468.27,"duration":40.24},{"text":"Certainly as to Johnson, he was told that he had been identified as the finger man.","start":468.27,"stop":473.631,"duration":5.36},{"text":"They did not come in and picked up a man near the scene or who might have some information about the crime.","start":473.631,"stop":479.264,"duration":5.63},{"text":"They were here to arrest these individuals, to place them under arrest and charge them with the crime for which they were ultimately tried and convicted and give him the death sentence.","start":479.264,"stop":490.912,"duration":11.65},{"text":"Cassidy is 25 years -- was 25 years of age at the time.","start":490.912,"stop":495.351,"duration":4.44},{"text":"He'd only completed an eight grade education.","start":495.351,"stop":497.903,"duration":2.55},{"text":"He had never had any contact with the -- with a police in the sense of being arrested or convicted of any crime before and the psychological data which is part of the record showed that he was a highly conflicted, immature individual with deep feelings of incompetence, inadequate personality, and that he needed narcotics to alleviate his anxieties and he was very passive and repented individual.","start":497.903,"stop":526.578,"duration":28.67},{"text":"And there is --","start":526.578,"stop":526.653,"duration":0.08}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Did the police know that?","start":526.653,"stop":529.283,"duration":2.63},{"text":"When they invest -- when they interrogated him?","start":529.283,"stop":532.354,"duration":3.07}]},{"speakerName":"Stanford Shmukler","textObjs":[{"text":"Sir, I've -- Justice Fortas, I would say that although there is no admission on the record by any of the police officer who made that arrest it was -- it should have been obvious to them.","start":532.354,"stop":544.087,"duration":11.73},{"text":"And especially in light of the petitioner's testimony at (Inaudible) -- at the motion for new trial hearing that he was under the influence of narcotics at the time.","start":544.087,"stop":558.107,"duration":14.02},{"text":"This should have been apparent to them.","start":558.107,"stop":560.016,"duration":1.91},{"text":"Now, whether they knew of his eight grade education, whether they knew his age, I assume they elicited that from him when they spoke to him.","start":560.016,"stop":567.852,"duration":7.84},{"text":"The psychological data --","start":567.852,"stop":569.111,"duration":1.26}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"There wouldn't be very likely they know whether he was schizoid personality, couldn't they in the part of the submission here?","start":569.111,"stop":576.129,"duration":7.02}]},{"speakerName":"Stanford Shmukler","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, Justice Fortas.","start":576.129,"stop":576.954,"duration":0.82},{"text":"I doubtedly would've known that and I doubted any of us would know that without the report of a psychiatrist or psychologist which of course was obtained here after they had been incarcerated.","start":576.954,"stop":588.247,"duration":11.29},{"text":"Johnson on the other hand was only 21 years of age.","start":588.247,"stop":590.918,"duration":2.67},{"text":"He had only had a seventh grade education.","start":590.918,"stop":593.456,"duration":2.54},{"text":"He had only one prior conviction and the psychological data is set forth in our brief.","start":593.456,"stop":599.931,"duration":6.48},{"text":"He was -- had intense feelings of insecurity and inadequacy.","start":599.931,"stop":604.874,"duration":4.94},{"text":"He was grossly inadequate with a schizoid personality and his ability in judgment would go to pieces under duress and strain.","start":604.874,"stop":614.284,"duration":9.41},{"text":"Now, these individuals with this limited ability to stand up to the official detention and custody were arrested.","start":614.284,"stop":628.06,"duration":13.78},{"text":"The first one, Cassidy was arrested at 4 a.m. in the morning in his home with seven police officers.","start":628.06,"stop":635.472,"duration":7.41},{"text":"He was taken to the Camden Police Station where he was confined thereafter and according to the affidavits, he sought -- he tried to consult with counsel.","start":635.472,"stop":645.907,"duration":10.44},{"text":"He wanted to consult with counsel.","start":645.907,"stop":647.723,"duration":1.82},{"text":"He wanted to consult with family and he was refused permission.","start":647.723,"stop":652.085,"duration":4.36},{"text":"There was no warrant for his arrest.","start":652.085,"stop":656.108,"duration":4.02},{"text":"In other words, a middle of the night arrest, large number of officers held incommunicado, his first confession was given five hours later.","start":656.108,"stop":666.872,"duration":10.76},{"text":"This wasn't sufficient for the police.","start":666.872,"stop":668.683,"duration":1.81},{"text":"They came back and they got another confession in which he modified his former confession.","start":668.683,"stop":673.662,"duration":4.98},{"text":"That was two hours later and then another 11 hours -- 11 and a half hours later, a third confession.","start":673.662,"stop":686.688,"duration":13.03},{"text":"The other petitioner, Johnson, was arrested in Newark and was held there at five o'clock in the evening, far from home, taken to the police station in Newark.","start":686.688,"stop":698.88,"duration":12.19},{"text":"Held there until this night court when apparently nothing happened that was significant to him or at least nothing which significantly warned him of any of his rights or gave him any advice or succor under these trying circumstances.","start":698.88,"stop":714.411,"duration":15.53},{"text":"He was brought back to Camden in the middle of the night at 1:30 or 2 o'clock in the morning.","start":714.411,"stop":720.061,"duration":5.65},{"text":"They put him the car.","start":720.061,"stop":721.681,"duration":1.62},{"text":"They drove him to Camden with a stop for a cup of coffee.","start":721.681,"stop":724.823,"duration":3.14},{"text":"During the time he claimed, he was questioned during the entire ride.","start":724.823,"stop":729.187,"duration":4.36},{"text":"In fact, he claimed that he was beaten during the course of this ride.","start":729.187,"stop":732.966,"duration":3.78},{"text":"And it wasn't until 4 o'clock in the morning, 4:45 in the morning that he gave his incriminating statements.","start":732.966,"stop":741.377,"duration":8.41},{"text":"Now under these circumstances, we believe that it is fairly clear that he needed the help and advice of a friendly face of an adviser, of someone to give him some kind of advice, and the Honorable Solicitor General has said that under these circumstances the only advice an attorney can give is to tell the defendant to keep quiet.","start":741.377,"stop":772.039,"duration":30.66},{"text":"I would like to differ with that.","start":772.039,"stop":773.213,"duration":1.17},{"text":"I think there's a lot more that an attorney can do under these circumstances.","start":773.213,"stop":778.184,"duration":4.97},{"text":"At that point, counsel could have advised him of the legal significance of admitting to a robbery.","start":778.184,"stop":787.402,"duration":9.22},{"text":"Now in the Escobedo case, the Court made a point of the fact that the defendant admitted to complicity in a crime not realizing the legal significance of that complicity.","start":787.402,"stop":802.276,"duration":14.87},{"text":"In this case, it became extremely important because this case was tried on a felony murder theory that there was a robbery.","start":802.276,"stop":811.579,"duration":9.3},{"text":"The petitioners have argued that there was no felony murder.","start":811.579,"stop":816.479,"duration":4.9},{"text":"There was no robbery.","start":816.479,"stop":818.327,"duration":1.85},{"text":"That they had gone to the store to obtain money from the store -- toy store operator, the man, the victim, the deceased which he owed to them.","start":818.327,"stop":828.926,"duration":10.6},{"text":"He owed to them not for a very nice purpose because apparently they had delivered some narcotics for him and they went there to get the money that he owes them, not to rob him.","start":828.926,"stop":838.781,"duration":9.85},{"text":"Therefore, when these individuals are held under these threatening, coercive circumstances, and are told that they are wanted -- they want a statement from these individuals as to what part they've had in this murder -- this robbery murder and they admit to being participants in a robbery they have signed their own doom without knowing the significance of it.","start":838.781,"stop":865.398,"duration":26.62},{"text":"Admitting to a robbery would've seen to them untrained and uncounseled by legal counsel at that point.","start":865.398,"stop":874.345,"duration":8.95},{"text":"Admitting to the robbery was a small matter compared to admitting to the homicide and what did they admit to?","start":874.345,"stop":880.981,"duration":6.64},{"text":"Well, Johnson admitted that he had been the one with the gun and he gave somewhat exculpatory statements as to why he shot the man.","start":880.981,"stop":890.736,"duration":9.75},{"text":"But mostly incriminatory admitting that there had been a participation of robbery.","start":890.736,"stop":896.253,"duration":5.52},{"text":"Cassidy and Godfrey for that matter, in effect said that Johnson was the man who did it and they didn't know anything about robbery and they didn't go there armed and so forth and so on and then changed this during the course of their second and third statements.","start":896.253,"stop":910.668,"duration":14.41}]},{"speakerName":"Hugo L.

involuntary.","start":404.678,"stop":434.787,"duration":30.11},{"text":"In Haynes, this Court said and they reiterated that the admissibility of a pretrial statement depended on its voluntariness

assessed.","start":434.787,"stop":454.689,"duration":19.9},{"text":"Therefore we say, we're still dealing with the question of

here.","start":489.929,"stop":502.952,"duration":13.02},{"text":"It offends our sense of justice to continue to incarcerate a convicted man where subsequent considerations cast grave doubts upon the reliability of the determination of guilt.","start":502.952,"stop":515.424,"duration":12.47},{"text":"So where a man is tried without a lawyer, we don't really know whether he was guilty or whether the acts that he committed constitute a crime.","start":515.424,"stop":523.621,"duration":8.2},{"text":"However here, the case in our case, the confessions were admittedly voluntarily, and admittedly true.","start":523.621,"stop":533.788,"duration":10.17},{"text":"So we don't have any question to concern ourselves on the reliability of the conviction.","start":533.788,"stop":539.632,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Again, I would point out that when Gideon overruled Betts v.
