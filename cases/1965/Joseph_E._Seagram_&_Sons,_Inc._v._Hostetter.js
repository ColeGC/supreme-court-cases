of price control, the contractual price control, a price war is going on and retailers and other people were selling liquor in a way that the legislature felt again, was not carrying out the objects of temperance and controlling the evils that are thought to flow from the unrestricted sale and consumption of liquor.","start":340.071,"stop":372.837,"duration":32.77},{"text":"So at that time, the legislature passed an Act which became law, which made price control mandatory, and they did that for the expressed purpose and I quote -- I don't quote this, I read this, as a result and for the purpose of eliminating price wars “which unduly stimulate the sale of liquor and wine, mandatory price control will be adopted.”","start":372.837,"stop":403.833,"duration":31},{"text":"Now, what mandatory price control was, the state said, the alcohol -- we, the distiller, the wholesaler -- the price set by the distiller for the sale and retail of the brand named product will be enforced by the State.","start":403.833,"stop":425.746,"duration":21.91},{"text":"In other words, the Alcoholic Control Board would enforce that and for instance, if a retailer sold at a price that was fixed, a

Board.","start":425.746,"stop":448.711,"duration":22.97},{"text":"It wasn't left to private enforcement and that was to a logic stand, very effective in keeping prices pegged by the distiller and there was no selling below cost.","start":448.711,"stop":465.638,"duration":16.93},{"text":"Now, we get down to 1960 and for various reasons unconnected with what I'm discussing now, a scandal broke out in the liquor authority in New York.","start":465.638,"stop":475.762,"duration":10.12},{"text":"It reached such proportions that Governor Rockefeller felt that it should be investigated and he appointed under an Act known as the Moreland Act, he appointed commissioners to make a study of the Alcoholic Control Board laws and what could be done to eliminate large fields of discretion which apparently brought about this corruption.","start":475.762,"stop":501.506,"duration":25.74},{"text":"He is the Governor, appointed three distinguished citizens of New York.","start":501.506,"stop":506.889,"duration":5.38},{"text":"The Chairman was former Judge Walsh, who was also an Assistant Attorney General of the United States.","start":506.889,"stop":516.1,"duration":9.21},{"text":"They conducted long hearings and investigated the whole ABC law and came up with a number of conclusions, most of which have no bearing here.","start":516.1,"stop":528.265,"duration":12.16},{"text":"But among the conclusions they came up with was that New York State or the citizens of New York State were paying about a dollar a quart or a dollar a fifth more for liquor throughout the -- in the state and than was being charged to citizens of the other states.","start":528.265,"stop":548.921,"duration":20.66},{"text":"Now and they've -- they said that the reason, and this is awfully important (Inaudible) -- I want to impress it on the Court, the reason that New York citizens were being charged more than citizens of other state was because of the mandatory price control provisions.","start":548.921,"stop":571.357,"duration":22.44},{"text":"And I would like to point to the findings of the Commission as they appear in the record or the recommendations of the committee, and I refer to page 157 of the record, and here's their conclusion, “For all of the foregoing reasons, we have concluded that Section 101 (c),” and Section 101 (c) was the mandatory price control provisions of the law, “injures the New York consumer in at least three important ways,” and then it goes on to talk about the price to the consumer in New York being higher and the elimination of free competition and having a competitive market in New York.","start":571.357,"stop":621.522,"duration":50.17},{"text":"They recommended to the Governor and to the legislature that this mandatory price provision be eliminated from the law, and they said, and it was their conclusion, that if this was done in spite of the fact that they intended to allow contractual fair trading to continue, it was their finding that with the elimination of mandatory price control, prices in New York would seek their natural level and the discrimination which they found against New York citizens would be eliminated.","start":621.522,"stop":659.066,"duration":37.54},{"text":"The Governor went along with that and a bill was introduced to provide for the elimination of mandatory price control, as well as the elimination of other practices which they had found to be bad and which do not concern us here.","start":659.066,"stop":675.134,"duration":16.07},{"text":"And the Governor in his message to the legislature, and that appears on page 188 of the record and I'm now reading from the first -- second full paragraph, such a compulsory resale price maintenance is at war with the American system of free competition.","start":675.134,"stop":696.772,"duration":21.64},{"text":"And then he goes on to say the result, and this is the result of mandatory price control, is that New York consumers have been compelled to pay on the average, $1 more per fifth of liquor than they would have to pay if they were a free market.","start":696.772,"stop":714.325,"duration":17.55},{"text":"And then goes on to say that this runs about 150 million a year.","start":714.325,"stop":719.983,"duration":5.66},{"text":"Again, I emphasize that what was causing this difference in price was mandatory price control.","start":719.983,"stop":725.979,"duration":6},{"text":"A bill was submitted to the legislature which contained the provision eliminating mandatory price control, and I may say parenthetically that the elimination of this mandatory price control does not apply to wine.","start":725.979,"stop":744.223,"duration":18.24},{"text":"New York State is a great grower of wine grapes and a great distiller, a manufacturer of wine.","start":744.223,"stop":750.668,"duration":6.45},{"text":"So apparently, the legislature was making a distinction there between wine and other alcoholic beverages.","start":750.668,"stop":761.135,"duration":10.47},{"text":"The legislature however, rejected the bill that had been introduced by the Governor, and a new bill was introduced which was in all respects, about the same except for the addition of Section 7, which I have referred to, and Section 9.","start":761.135,"stop":785.888,"duration":24.75},{"text":"Now, those were incorporated in the new bill.","start":785.888,"stop":796.18,"duration":10.29},{"text":"The Act, which became law and which we're attacking now appears in the appendix commencing at A5 but if Your Honors would turn
