Friedman","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.","start":8.985,"stop":11.886,"duration":2.9},{"text":"When the Court rose at the recess yesterday, I had completed my discussion of the relevant market.","start":11.886,"stop":18.606,"duration":6.72},{"text":"Now, I'd like to turn to showing that the District Court correctly held defendants have monopolized that market.","start":18.606,"stop":26.21,"duration":7.6},{"text":"The offense of monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act involves two elements.","start":26.21,"stop":31.723,"duration":5.51},{"text":"The first is the existence of the monopoly power and the second is the conscience or willful acquisition or maintenance of that power.","start":31.723,"stop":41.559,"duration":9.84},{"text":"And we think the record in this case shows that defendants possessed both of those elements.","start":41.559,"stop":48.094,"duration":6.54},{"text":"The monopoly power has been described as the power to fix prices or to exclude competition.","start":48.094,"stop":57.057,"duration":8.96},{"text":"Now when -- in this case, when Grinnell acquired an 87% interest in these companies by acquiring -- controlling interest of them over four-year period, it put together a combination, in one hand, of the overwhelming share of the market.","start":57.057,"stop":75.715,"duration":18.66},{"text":"And this kind of a share of the market under the control of one person is ordinarily enough, we think, to show the existence of monopoly power.","start":75.715,"stop":85.673,"duration":9.96},{"text":"I'd like to refer this Court to a passage of the opinion of Judge Learned Hand in the Alcoa case which this Court‘s specifically approved in the subsequent American Tobacco decision.","start":85.673,"stop":98.969,"duration":13.3},{"text":"There, Judge Hand stated, “We may start therefore with the premise that to have combined 90% of the producers of ingot would have been to “monopolize” the ingot market and so far as concerns the public interest, it can make no difference whether an existing competition is put an end to or whether prospective competition is prevented.”","start":98.969,"stop":123.277,"duration":24.31},{"text":"Now in the Cellophane case, this Court assumed that if Cellophane were the relevant market that du Pont's control of 75% of that market would be enough to give du Pont monopoly power.","start":123.277,"stop":138.436,"duration":15.16},{"text":"In this case, the share of the market 87% is very close to the 90% that Alcoa had.","start":138.436,"stop":147.021,"duration":8.58},{"text":"And in addition here to the just the percentages themselves, we have other -- in the issue of monopoly power, the existence of substantial price discriminations, and the further fact that within this market, after the three companies which Grinnell acquired, there's no one else that has anywhere near this share.","start":147.021,"stop":165.866,"duration":18.85},{"text":"The two largest companies after that have roughly 1.5% and then it goes down very rapidly.","start":165.866,"stop":172.633,"duration":6.77},{"text":"Now, the combination that Grinnell put together in this case not only acquired this large share of the market but it further prevented the resumption of competition among the defendant alarm companies that was a -- to be anticipated when these old restrictive agreements were about to expire.","start":172.633,"stop":194.536,"duration":21.9},{"text":"Shortly before the agreements were due to expire in the late 1940s, Grinnell and ADT had a series of discussions as to what the future relationships of the company should be.","start":194.536,"stop":207.675,"duration":13.14},{"text":"Under the old agreement, Grinnell was supplying these devices in return for 25% share of the revenues generated by the services for which the devices were provided.","start":207.675,"stop":218.698,"duration":11.02},{"text":"And Grinnell indicated it would like to continue this arrangement.","start":218.698,"stop":222.273,"duration":3.57},{"text":"But ADT's counsel advised that in its view, this arrangement by which Grinnell had supplied the devices was an illegal exclusive dealing agreement that violated the Sherman Act.","start":222.273,"stop":234.519,"duration":12.25},{"text":"And during the course of these discussions between Grinnell and ADT, Mr. Fleming, the president of Grinnell stated as follows, and this is at page 1433 of the record.","start":234.519,"stop":248.677,"duration":14.16},{"text":"Mr. Fleming stated that Grinnell -- that he did not feel that Grinnell would be prepared to go completely out of the supervisory business in 1954 even if no agreement were reached for the ADT company.","start":248.677,"stop":262.466,"duration":13.79},{"text":"As we very definitely had in mind in such contingency, and we're preparing now to go into the central station business generally, including both supervisory, burglary etcetera service, if this became necessary, although, we would still much prefer to renew our arrangements with the ADT on a fair basis.","start":262.466,"stop":283.212,"duration":20.75},{"text":"Now at the trial, Mr. Fleming testified that there were more than -- there's more than one reason why they acquired Holmes.","start":283.212,"stop":291.328,"duration":8.12},{"text":"He stated as Holmes' counsel has advised the court that it was acquired as an investment.","start":291.328,"stop":295.947,"duration":4.62},{"text":"He also stated that they had another reason for acquiring Holmes and this is at 676 of the record which was -- so that we would know something about or have someone in the organization who knew something about the burglar alarm business, so we could compete with ADT.","start":295.947,"stop":313.336,"duration":17.39},{"text":"And he also testified at record 688 that after Grinnell had acquired both AFA and Holmes, and before it acquired ADT, the company considered whether we would merge Holmes and AFA, whether we would be in a better position to compete with ADT.","start":313.336,"stop":332.387,"duration":19.05},{"text":"So this record we think shows that prior to the time that Grinnell had acquired ADT, it was seriously considering going in to the central station business.","start":332.387,"stop":344.99,"duration":12.6},{"text":"Now, the effect of its acquiring ADT was to eliminate any possibility of this competition because it had now combined in one source these different companies which were potential competitors.","start":344.99,"stop":358.557,"duration":13.57},{"text":"And thus in effect, the result of this acquisition and combination was to continue the very restrictive agreements that had been going on for almost half a century.","start":358.557,"stop":371.447,"duration":12.89},{"text":"And in the passage from Alcoa that I just referred to, Judge Hand pointed out that the combination is bad if it restricts not only actual existing competitions, but also potential competition.","start":371.447,"stop":384.48,"duration":13.03},{"text":"Now, the second element of illegal monopolization, the conscious or willful acquisition and maintenance of that power is also we think clearly shown by this record.","start":384.48,"stop":394.526,"duration":10.05},{"text":"I have referred at some length yesterday to the various restrictive and exclusionary practices which ADT engaged in.","start":394.526,"stop":402.088,"duration":7.56},{"text":"And it seems to us that these practices clearly show that in this case, ADT did not have the monopoly power thrust upon it, and that Grinnell, certainly, when it acquired these companies and combined them, it didn't have the power thrust upon it.","start":402.088,"stop":417.824,"duration":15.74},{"text":"It went out and acquired these companies and they have this combination.","start":417.824,"stop":421.04,"duration":3.22},{"text":"Now, it's true that there's nothing in this record to show that a -- that Grinnell in any way actively interfered in the management of the subsidiaries, but it had a clear control over these companies.","start":421.04,"stop":432.186,"duration":11.15},{"text":"It had anywhere from 80 to a 100%.","start":432.186,"stop":435.112,"duration":2.93},{"text":"It nominated the boards of directors, it controlled the boards of directors.","start":435.112,"stop":438.991,"duration":3.88},{"text":"Mr. Fleming, the president of Grinnell was also the president of ADT and we think that is clearly enough to prevent -- that Grinnell is responsible for the continuation of this monopolization.","start":438.991,"stop":451.055,"duration":12.06},{"text":"And to sum it up, I'd like to refer to the statement at page 782 of the record.","start":451.055,"stop":458.429,"duration":7.37},{"text":"This is one -- a passage from the opinion -- I'm sorry, 762 of the record from the opinion of the District Court, in which the District Court said that describing the share of the market of these companies, that this share of the market rests not on the scale, efficiency, and fairness side of defendants, not even on their neutrally normal business matters, but on violations of per se rules governing restraints of trade and on acquisitions indicating that growth was a response to external grasp, not to internal grip.","start":458.429,"stop":495.862,"duration":37.43},{"text":"So that we think that on this record and on this holding by the District Court, the District -- that the conclusion is that Grinnell and the defendants acquired and held this share of the market as the result of practices which make the possession of this power illegal.","start":495.862,"stop":515.77,"duration":19.91},{"text":"And we therefore find it unnecessary to reach the District Court's suggestion and the statements that illegal monopolization maybe presumed merely from showing an overwhelming percentage of the market without regard to any other factors.","start":515.77,"stop":533.818,"duration":18.05},{"text":"This is -- the court said this is a couple of questions, but we think this record and this indication by the court to which I have referred, shows that without reaching that, this judgment maybe -- the finding of violation, maybe sustained.","start":533.818,"stop":547.844,"duration":14.03},{"text":"So that as we see the case on this aspect of it, this we think comes within the many decisions of this Court which have recognized that this percentage of the market obtained and held under these circumstances is enough to show illegal monopolization.","start":547.844,"stop":567.152,"duration":19.31},{"text":"Now -- I would now like to turn to the next point in the case which is the question of the relief.","start":567.152,"stop":573.741,"duration":6.59},{"text":"On this aspect of the case, this is the subject of the Government's appeal in number 73.","start":573.741,"stop":578.322,"duration":4.58},{"text":"We contend that the relief is inadequate in significant respects, contrary-wise the defendants claimed the relief is excessive in some respect.","start":578.322,"stop":587.719,"duration":9.4},{"text":"I'd like to give a little --","start":587.719,"stop":588.569,"duration":0.85}]},{"speakerName":"Potter

Friedman","textObjs":[{"text":"I suppose so, yes.","start":611.433,"stop":613.819,"duration":2.39},{"text":"I might say Mr. Justice that neither of these two provisions which the judge included where requested by the Government below, the judge quoted this on his own.","start":613.819,"stop":623.48,"duration":9.66},{"text":"Now, I'd like to give a little of the background as the circumstances under which the relief was given in this case because we think this is significant.","start":623.48,"stop":632.161,"duration":8.68},{"text":"In the pretrial proceeding which I will discuss in more detail when I come to the discussion of a fair trial point, the judge suggested that each side should submit a draft that what relief it believed would be appropriate in the event that the Government would have prevail.","start":632.161,"stop":650.879,"duration":18.72},{"text":"And the Government submitted a proposed brief on the merits of the case and also a proposed draft of an opinion.","start":650.879,"stop":659.097,"duration":8.22},{"text":"And the defendants then submitted their suggestions.","start":659.097,"stop":662.856,"duration":3.76},{"text":"Now, these suggestions although phrased in the form of a consent judgment which seems to us are clearly not a consent judgment, the defendant's document, their brief on relief at page 162 begins as follows: Pursuant to this Court's order of December 18th, 1963, this brief presents Grinnell's views on the relief which would be appropriate if plaintiff were to prevail on the question of liability.","start":662.856,"stop":695.718,"duration":32.86},{"text":"This -- this isn't these were not just discussions between the parties as to the basis on which the case should be settled.","start":695.718,"stop":702.379,"duration":6.66},{"text":"These were formal suggestions filed in the court in response to the court's requests which in turn was in response to the suggestion of the defendants.","start":702.379,"stop":713.544,"duration":11.16},{"text":"Now in these statements that defendants brought in response to the Government's proposal, they in substance agreed to several of the Government's proposals which are the subject of the Government's appeal.","start":713.544,"stop":726.65,"duration":13.11},{"text":"They differed as to the extent of these provisions in the form that they basically accepted our theory, and in addition two of the items in which we're appealing, they accepted the identical language used by the Government.","start":726.65,"stop":740.668,"duration":14.02},{"text":"The District Court without discussing any of these proposals added a judgment which has been indicated by Mr. Sonnett, generally enjoined them from violating Act directed to Grinnell to dispose of its stock in the three alarm companies and prohibited any of these companies for making any further acquisitions.","start":740.668,"stop":761.688,"duration":21.02},{"text":"Now, we think this relief is inadequate and as we have set forth in our brief in at least four significant respects.","start":761.688,"stop":770.209,"duration":8.52},{"text":"The first one which we think is the most serious is the failure in any way to do anything to dissipate the market power of ADT.","start":770.209,"stop":781.02,"duration":10.81},{"text":"ADT has 73% of the market.","start":781.02,"stop":783.936,"duration":2.92},{"text":"This share obviously is the keystone on which the entire combinations market power depends.","start":783.936,"stop":790.926,"duration":6.99},{"text":"This is the foundation of this power.","start":790.926,"stop":794.327,"duration":3.4},{"text":"And merely to break up the combination, merely to direct Grinnell to dispose of its holdings in these three alarm companies without in any way doing anything to deal with the power of ADT itself, it's not enough to restore competition in this business, because ADT's share of the market is so large in itself is monopoly power.","start":794.327,"stop":818.043,"duration":23.72},{"text":"It gives ADT the very kind of power which Section 2 of the Sherman Act is directed against.","start":818.043,"stop":824.272,"duration":6.23},{"text":"And indeed the defendants themselves in the District Court recognized this fact because at page 179 of the record, in their brief discussing the Government's proposal, they said in the third paragraph, “Moreover, defendants agree with the Government that if it were to prevail, some further divestiture of ADT would be appropriate i.e. we agree that in certain cities which can support two or more central stations, but where ADT now provides the only central station service, an effort should be made to establish a healthy competitor.”","start":824.272,"stop":864.95,"duration":40.68},{"text":"Now of course we realized that these statements are not binding on the court but we do point out that the defendants themselves have recognized the basic reason to most of our proposals.","start":864.95,"stop":875.491,"duration":10.54},{"text":"Now, there was a short disagreement between the Government and defendants in the District Court as to how extensive this divestiture should be.","start":875.491,"stop":882.971,"duration":7.48},{"text":"We asked the divestiture in 46 cities, the defendants suggested divestiture in 13 cities would be opposed.","start":882.971,"stop":888.873,"duration":5.9},{"text":"We are not asking this Court to tend to work out such details that is obviously a matter for the District Court.","start":888.873,"stop":894.866,"duration":5.99},{"text":"But we do urge this Court to send it back to the District Court to indicate that something should be done to break up the power of ADT.","start":894.866,"stop":905.711,"duration":10.85},{"text":"Now, the other provisions
