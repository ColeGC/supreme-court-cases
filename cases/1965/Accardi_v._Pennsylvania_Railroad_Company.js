first is whether the measure of the separation allowances, what the contract between the union and the railroad calls length of compensated service was seniority in the statuary sense.","start":335.99,"stop":353.33,"duration":17.34},{"text":"And the second question is, if so, are these allowances accorded on the basis of seniority the kind of benefits which the Act means to protect for the veteran?","start":353.33,"stop":371.222,"duration":17.89},{"text":"And the first of these questions requires us to examine the concept of seniority as it's used in the Act.","start":371.222,"stop":380.723,"duration":9.5},{"text":"And I think we can usefully approach this by asking why Congress should have selected seniority as a standard of the veterans' reemployment rights.","start":380.723,"stop":395.838,"duration":15.12},{"text":"It's clear I think what the basic impulse behind these veterans legislation is.","start":395.838,"stop":403.085,"duration":7.25},{"text":"It's the feeling that veterans should not be penalized in their civilian employment careers, by reason of having been called into the armed services in an hour of the country's great need.","start":403.085,"stop":420.234,"duration":17.15},{"text":"On the other hand, if this thought, this desire for equality were carried to its logical extreme, the results would be rather disruptive and impractical.","start":420.234,"stop":433.141,"duration":12.91},{"text":"Because if one really wants to fully equalize the employments status of a veteran and of a nonveteran, that would mean, for example, compiling the employer to make up the difference in pay scales between the armed forces and the civilian employment.","start":433.141,"stop":455.509,"duration":22.37},{"text":"Or it might require compelling an employer to attribute to a veteran a skill or qualification that he might have received had he not been inducted into the armed forces but that he didn't receive.","start":455.509,"stop":474.397,"duration":18.89},{"text":"In other words, there are difficult questions in social policy involved in -- if one is to go so far as to require an employer to pay a veteran for work he didn't do or for a skill he didn't attain, although he would have.","start":474.397,"stop":491.542,"duration":17.14},{"text":"On the other hand, as Congress well knew, at least in those industries where collective bargaining with independent unions is the prevailing mode of regulating industrial relations, many of the perquisites of employment, promotions of various sorts, wage increases, vacation rights, retirement rights, order of lay-off and recall, are made to flow automatically from the length of the employee's service with the employer.","start":491.542,"stop":527.965,"duration":36.42},{"text":"And these benefits or perquisites are not intended to compensate an employee for the work he's done or as an incentive better work in the future.","start":527.965,"stop":540.143,"duration":12.18},{"text":"And if you require just these benefits, benefits which are accorded mechanically, automatically on a basis of time served to a veteran as if he had never been inducted, you don't have any of these disruptive effects on the employer's managerial discretion.","start":540.143,"stop":563.687,"duration":23.54},{"text":"And we submit that in making seniority the statutory test to these veterans' employment rights, Congress meant to protect for the veteran this entire range of benefits which are conferred on the basis of how long you've been on the job.","start":563.687,"stop":581.87,"duration":18.18},{"text":"And don't have any implication of the reward for the value the employee's contribution or for the skill of his work.","start":581.87,"stop":594.983,"duration":13.11},{"text":"And if this is the proper test, then clearly, the veterans in this case were improperly denied separate -- the full separation allowances to which they were entitled because the measure used in this agreement defined the amount of separation allowances.","start":594.983,"stop":615.577,"duration":20.59},{"text":"What the parties called length of compensated service was in all practical respects a measure based on time of the employee in the railroads employ and it had nothing to do with attempting to compensate employees for their particular contributions to the railroad's business or for the skills they had attained or
