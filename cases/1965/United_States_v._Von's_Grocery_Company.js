reasons.","start":171.381,"stop":177.914,"duration":6.53},{"text":"First, this Court's decision will provide guidance to the enforcement of this law in the nation's largest industry and the industry which has the most direct and immediate concern to every American family.","start":177.914,"stop":193.787,"duration":15.87},{"text":"And second, that we think that this case perhaps more than any previous case before this Court, with possible exception of the Brown Shoe case, tests whether Section 7 is in fact, as its framers intended it to be an effective preventive remedy against anticompetitive practices and effects and before I begin my argument, let me offer a brief summary of the government's legal theory.","start":193.787,"stop":226.979,"duration":33.19},{"text":"We rest our case on four propositions.","start":226.979,"stop":231.657,"duration":4.68},{"text":"First, that Section 7's basic concern is with preventing the emergence of highly concentrated or oligopolistic markets, the kind of markets which breed anticompetitive business behavior.","start":231.657,"stop":248.873,"duration":17.22},{"text":"Second, we think that in light of this prophylactic statutory purpose, a merger that occurs in a market which is still competitive in its behavior but which appears to be turning the corner into a situation of oligopoly it seems to be crystallizing as an oligopolistic market that deserves very close scrutiny under the statute.","start":248.873,"stop":276.015,"duration":27.14},{"text":"And I'll explain that this was precisely the situation in Los Angeles on the eve of the merger where in this large market of 4000 competing concerns, eight had among them almost two-fifths of total sales and this is the level which students of industrial organization had deemed oligopolistic.","start":276.015,"stop":302.064,"duration":26.05},{"text":"And furthermore, and very relevant here, this market share of the major firms had been increasing steadily for a substantial period of time before the merger and as we point out in our reply brief, this trend towards ever increasing concentration has continued steadily and uninterruptedly since the merger.","start":302.064,"stop":327.823,"duration":25.76},{"text":"Now third, where in such a -- such an industrial setting a merger unites two leading sellers in the market, two of the handful major firms which have emerged with significant market shares and in doing so, the merger has contributed substantially to the concentration movement.","start":327.823,"stop":355.018,"duration":27.19},{"text":"We think the statute requires that it'd be forbidden in the absence of a clear contrary showing -- a clear rebuttal to the government's case.","start":355.018,"stop":366.595,"duration":11.58},{"text":"And I'll explain when I get to that point, the kinds of evidence that we think is admissible and relevant in rebutting the government's case.","start":366.595,"stop":379.826,"duration":13.23},{"text":"I'll explain that the merger of Von's and Shopping Bag which united the third and sixth largest firms in this major local market, was the kind of merger which eliminates a -- one of the few market leaders and thereby substantially increases its concentration.","start":379.826,"stop":401.711,"duration":21.88},{"text":"That's the kind of merger that should be forbidden unless the defendants can come back with some -- with a strong showing that the merger -- that the merger is in fact unlikely to have adverse effects.","start":401.711,"stop":415.045,"duration":13.33},{"text":"And then finally, I'll try to show that appellees have not sustained their burden of rebuttal of the government's case.","start":415.045,"stop":425.474,"duration":10.43},{"text":"Let me begin then by describing the relevant market, its history and structure and behavior on the eve of the merger.","start":425.474,"stop":436.668,"duration":11.19},{"text":"Now, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Areas, Los Angeles and Orange County's, constitute a vast retail grocery market where the total sales of grocery stores and supermarkets run about two and a half billion dollars a year, which incidentally is as much as for example, the entire retail shoe industry in the United States.","start":436.668,"stop":462.598,"duration":25.93},{"text":"This is just one local market, a local market which really dwarfs some whole industries that had been involved in previous Section 7 proceedings.","start":462.598,"stop":476.989,"duration":14.39},{"text":"Now in a retail market of this size, one expects to and does find a large variety in number of competing grocery concerns and the District Court found that there were 4000 separate companies at the time of the merger and these are -- covered a considerable range in type of operation.","start":476.989,"stop":501.802,"duration":24.81},{"text":"At the top you had the large supermarkets, for example, Safeway -- large supermarket chains like Safeway which is a large national chain, which has in Los Angeles many supermarkets throughout the Area, each one of them might do a substantial buy-in like perhaps $5 million a year.","start":501.802,"stop":524.76,"duration":22.96},{"text":"These chains had Dun and Bradstreet's top financial rating which enabled them to at least base in shopping centers.","start":524.76,"stop":532.81,"duration":8.05},{"text":"They had their own warehousing and trucking facilities so they could buy direct without going through middleman and these large chains which as I'll explain, included Von's and Shopping Bag, were able to advertise in the Citywide Media, the newspapers, because they had enough stores scattered throughout the Area.","start":532.81,"stop":556.648,"duration":23.84},{"text":"Now at the other end of the scale, one has hundreds and perhaps thousands of very small stores, delicatessens, the corner grocery which in Los Angels are called Mom and Pop Stores.","start":556.648,"stop":570.79,"duration":14.14},{"text":"These are often very small and with antiquated facilities and appointments, and inadequate parking space, but between these extremes, there's very large and a very small firms.","start":570.79,"stop":584.486,"duration":13.7},{"text":"The evidence shows that there are -- there is a range, small chains prosperous independent operators and the record also shows that there is a certain mobility, an upward and downward mobility in this market that small firms can wax large.","start":584.486,"stop":603.31,"duration":18.82},{"text":"They can acquire stores and build themselves into chains and then very often or sometimes a chain may over-expand and get into trouble and go broke.","start":603.31,"stop":616.192,"duration":12.88},{"text":"There is new entries in this market.","start":616.192,"stop":618.369,"duration":2.18},{"text":"There are new companies or enterprising businessmen who come in and then there are very many who leave.","start":618.369,"stop":628.365,"duration":10},{"text":"The record clearly shows a long steady decline in the number of firms operating there.","start":628.365,"stop":636.844,"duration":8.48},{"text":"Now, given this -- with this large variety and mobility of competitors in this market, there's unquestionably a certain competitive format.","start":636.844,"stop":652.908,"duration":16.06},{"text":"Now, the District Court found that competition among the grocery stores and supermarkets, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area is vigorous and we don't dispute that finding on this appeal.","start":652.908,"stop":667.595,"duration":14.69},{"text":"Now at -- that the appellees seem to think that once we make this concession, once we agree that there was competition in this market at the time of the merger and for the few years thereafter which are covered in this record, we're out of court.","start":667.595,"stop":686.456,"duration":18.86},{"text":"It seems to me that their brief is substantially devoted to the proposition that this was indeed a competitive market.","start":686.456,"stop":699.521,"duration":13.06},{"text":"And we think this really is the beginning rather than the end of the Section 7 analysis because the Section 7 is really to be an effective preventive against the lessened competition which is associated with highly concentrated industries.","start":699.521,"stop":717.762,"duration":18.24},{"text":"You can't force the government to wait in intervening in a merger movement until the market has ceased to be competitive.","start":717.762,"stop":729.035,"duration":11.27},{"text":"The point for intervention is that point where the market while still competitive is becoming concentrated where there are signs that -- it is beginning to crystallized in a wrong sort of way and while we don't dispute the proposition that it may be very difficult in many cases to know when a market is in danger where its competitive structure is in jeopardy, we think this is a very clear case for finding that the market was in this state at the time of the merger that it was in a dangerous transitional phase towards undue concentration.","start":729.035,"stop":777.929,"duration":48.89},{"text":"And hence it had reached a point in development where mergers have to be very carefully scrutinized to make sure that they are not moving the market towards this undesirable state.","start":777.929,"stop":798.273,"duration":20.34},{"text":"Now the factors on which we rely for this initial proposition here that this market was in danger, if you will, on the eve of the merger is that the market share of a small group of large firms have been increasing steadily for the period of time covered in this record prior to the merger.","start":798.273,"stop":824.454,"duration":26.18},{"text":"For example, in 1948, the eight largest firms had had 34% of total sales in development market and by 1958, that figure had reached 41%.","start":824.454,"stop":839.93,"duration":15.48},{"text":"The share of the 16 largest firms had increased from 42 to 53%, the share of the 20 largest from 44 to 57%.","start":839.93,"stop":852.382,"duration":12.45},{"text":"Now perhaps I should remark parenthetically at this point why throughout this proceeding, the government in presenting market share statistics has focused on particular years, 1948, 1954, 1958 and 1963.","start":852.382,"stop":874.084,"duration":21.7},{"text":"The reason is simply that these were years in which the Census Bureau conducted a business census.","start":874.084,"stop":880.735,"duration":6.65},{"text":"Now, market share statistics obviously can't be derived and are not reliable unless you have a sum total against which you compare the shares of an individual firm or group of firms.","start":880.735,"stop":895.61,"duration":14.88},{"text":"You have to have what statisticians call a universe.","start":895.61,"stop":899.751,"duration":4.14},{"text":"And in this case of course, the appropriate universe for computing the percentage shares of these major firms are total sales of the grocery stores and supermarkets in Los Angeles.","start":899.751,"stop":914.543,"duration":14.79},{"text":"And since there are 4000 of them and many of them very small, and since the sum total is in the neighborhood of two billion or more, it's very difficult to gather these reliable universe figures.","start":914.543,"stop":928.472,"duration":13.93},{"text":"Now, I don't think anyone disputes the fact that the Census Bureau is equipped to make these determinations, but once you leave census years for which you do have those determinations, you embark on a sea of uncertainties.","start":928.472,"stop":945.793,"duration":17.32},{"text":"You are left with gross estimates and projections and guesses and samples of various sort and appellees have relied on some years, not census years, to show various market shares and we just want to remind the Court of the fundamental unreliability of market share statistics which don't have this census universe.","start":945.793,"stop":976.49,"duration":30.7},{"text":"Now, having said that let me hasten to add that appellees own figures in general confirm the government's census data, showing this increase in concentration up to the time of the merger.","start":976.49,"stop":992.701,"duration":16.21},{"text":"They have a table which is at page 2788 of the record which shows that between 1950, which was the first -- first year in that table and 1958, the share of the eight largest firms in this market increased from 33 to 39%.","start":992.701,"stop":1011.687,"duration":18.99},{"text":"Now, their table shows a falling off of some extent in 1959, but that was a year in which a strike closed the major chains in Los Angels while leaving the smaller stores open for a month and this caused a large diversion of business to these smaller fellows and distort the year's statistics on market share.","start":1011.687,"stop":1043.035,"duration":31.35},{"text":"So however you look at it, the trend towards higher and higher levels of concentration is clear and as we point out in our relied -- in our reply brief, again using census figures, this trend continued after the merger until 1963, which is the last census year.","start":1043.035,"stop":1064.676,"duration":21.64}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
