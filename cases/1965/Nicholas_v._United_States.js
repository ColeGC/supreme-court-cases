obligations.","start":313.281,"stop":337.834,"duration":24.55},{"text":"We believe that the reasons for the denial of this post-petition interest may merit the Court's attention for a few moments

filing of the arrangement petition.","start":337.834,"stop":360.823,"duration":22.99},{"text":"We take strong issue with the Government on this point.","start":360.823,"stop":366.252,"duration":5.43},{"text":"First place, these decisions say that delay of distribution in bankruptcy is an act of law.","start":366.252,"stop":372.683,"duration":6.43},{"text":"It's not attributable to the fault of a court officer if there's a delay in distribution to the Government of its claim that these delays occur as necessary under the Bankruptcy Act.","start":372.683,"stop":385.113,"duration":12.43},{"text":"They say further that for the very practical reason, we must have a cut-off date.","start":385.113,"stop":391.403,"duration":6.29},{"text":"There's an 1893 decision by this Court, the Thomas case cited in our brief where it says that the cut-off date as to interest is a necessary incident to the settlement of estates.","start":391.403,"stop":402.712,"duration":11.31},{"text":"At some point, we must stop, compute all the obligations and pay them.","start":402.712,"stop":407.997,"duration":5.29},{"text":"Now obviously, and for a third reason, if the obligations bear different rates of interest, it's unfair to let that interest accumulate after the petitioner's file.","start":407.997,"stop":418.419,"duration":10.42},{"text":"It's unfair to the creditors whose claims bear a smaller rate of interest contractually.","start":418.419,"stop":423.841,"duration":5.42},{"text":"If they do not bear a rate of interest but you award a rate of interest under some statute as the Government here appraised then the fellow who suffers is the general creditor who finds that where he thought he had some dividend, where he thought he'd received some return on the money he's lost, in fact he receives nothing because that money is consumed in post-petition interest paid the Government.","start":423.841,"stop":447.546,"duration":23.7},{"text":"We do not believe either the Government or the entire class of creditors of which the Government is only one party should receive that advantage over the unsecured creditors, and indeed Justice Black, in the Vanston Bondholders case which we've quoted at some length at various places on our brief says that interest itself is a penalty on creditors.","start":447.546,"stop":468.615,"duration":21.07},{"text":"And it's a penalty we submit to the Court without any fault on the creditor's part.","start":468.615,"stop":473.359,"duration":4.74},{"text":"They suffered the burden as the question has just indicated, not the trustee from this delay.","start":473.359,"stop":480.042,"duration":6.68},{"text":"And then alluding again to the Saper case, the 1949 decision which must constitute the backbone of my argument to Your Honors today, the Saper case pointed out that the Bankruptcy Act sought to equate the Government as a participant in Bankruptcy proceedings with other creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings.","start":480.042,"stop":498.474,"duration":18.43},{"text":"That since the Government was a party to them, the Government must abide by the same rules and I submit that the Government, since Your Honors' pronouncement on the Spears case, I believe to be a warning that the Government must protect itself and avail itself from the statutory procedures at its command.","start":498.474,"stop":515.727,"duration":17.25},{"text":"And I hope by the time I reserve for closing, I can emphasize that point again if it requires emphasis.","start":515.727,"stop":522.246,"duration":6.52},{"text":"At any rate the Saper case said that tax claims were the same as other claims and that there was a pattern of distribution prescribed by the Bankruptcy Act that that pattern of distribution should not be varied by other federal legislation in other fields.","start":522.246,"stop":538.901,"duration":16.65},{"text":"Where there was a tendency in all the cases as we have cited them, a great many of the cases to find independent internal revenue regulations and to try to give those equality with or priority over a bankruptcy petition or Bankruptcy Act provision.","start":538.901,"stop":557.119,"duration":18.22},{"text":"Now, we submit to Your Honors that since the Saper case which did set up the rule that there'd be no post-petition interest, there has been a constant effort on the part of secured creditors and the Government to emasculate the Saper rule, to try to carve out exceptions to it which should have the effect of eating it up without belaboring those points, they're treated in the brief, but they're the type of situations where the estate proves to be solved then obviously interest should be given, the situation where the security itself produces substantial income.","start":557.119,"stop":586.976,"duration":29.86},{"text":"Then in that situation, the creditor who has that security should receive its benefit because the unsecured creditor behind him suffers no loss.","start":586.976,"stop":597.716,"duration":10.74},{"text":"We believe that each of those arguments is equally applicable here where the interest that is sought is against the general estate because of the failure of the debtor, its antagonist, we submit, to withhold the monies or return over the monies that it was required by statute to withhold and account for.","start":597.716,"stop":620.5,"duration":22.78},{"text":"We believe that the Government in the case at hand and were successful before the Fifth Circuit is attempting to create an exception in which it visits the vicarious liability on an innocent party, the unsecured creditor that stands behind the Government or the tax creditor who stands in the same -- on the same plane with the Government.","start":620.5,"stop":641.506,"duration":21.01},{"text":"And we believe that the Government by attempting to create a vicarious liability on that trustee which is the door into the general estate threatens to secure to itself an unwanted advantage, an advantage that it does not need if it tends to its own bankruptcy affairs.","start":641.506,"stop":659.752,"duration":18.25},{"text":"And that by doing so, it threatens seriously the whole fabric of bankruptcy administration; a fabric which the Saper case says provides an orderly rule of administration which should not be ordered because of internal revenue statutes which might be held.","start":659.752,"stop":678.627,"duration":18.88},{"text":"And we must say to Your Honors, we find nothing that would directly conflict --","start":678.627,"stop":683.162,"duration":4.54}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
