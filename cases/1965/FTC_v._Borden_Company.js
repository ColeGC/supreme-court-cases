Circuit.","start":54.839,"stop":60.634,"duration":5.8},{"text":"The Court of Appeals set aside an order of the Federal Trade Commission which had directed the Borden Company to cease discriminating in price between competing purchasers in a case which arose out of the sales of evaporated milk, allegedly in violation of Section 2 (a) of the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.","start":60.634,"stop":83.51,"duration":22.88},{"text":"It's pertinent here that Section 2 (a) makes it unlawful to discriminate in price between purchasers of commodities “of like grade and quality” where the effect maybe substantially to lessen competition.","start":83.51,"stop":100.361,"duration":16.85},{"text":"The Borden Company sells milk, evaporated milk under the well known Borden brands all over the United States.","start":100.361,"stop":110.329,"duration":9.97},{"text":"It also sells evaporated milk to certain customers under the brands of the labels of those customers referred to in this record as private label milk.","start":110.329,"stop":120.557,"duration":10.23},{"text":"Physically, the milk in each instance was identical both the milk itself and the containers and the question presented is whether the Borden label milk and the private label milk are to be considered commodities of like grade and quality within the meaning of Section 2 (a).","start":120.557,"stop":142.93,"duration":22.37},{"text":"The question arose very briefly in these circumstances.","start":142.93,"stop":145.304,"duration":2.37},{"text":"The Commission held that because the goods were physically identical, they were like grade and quality.","start":145.304,"stop":151.84,"duration":6.54},{"text":"It went on to find discrimination and injury and price between the customers for Borden and the customers for the private label milk.","start":151.84,"stop":165.613,"duration":13.77},{"text":"It concluded that the two-price system may have the effect substantially less than competition both at the primary line that is vis à vis the competitors of Borden, packers of milk and at the secondary line that is wholesale and retail customers for the Borden milk.","start":165.613,"stop":187.301,"duration":21.69},{"text":"Now, those findings are not an issue here because the court below did not reach them.","start":187.301,"stop":191.33,"duration":4.03},{"text":"We're not asking for review.","start":191.33,"stop":193.6,"duration":2.27},{"text":"I think whatever it is useful to put the legal issue in context to review just generally the basis for those conclusions.","start":193.6,"stop":200.573,"duration":6.97},{"text":"The Commission noted at the primary line level that there had been a decline generally in the evaporated milk sales throughout the industry, that 10 producers largely in the Midwest area had dropped out of this business since 1950 that there had been no new entrants and that in the circumstances, there was a little need to ship the competitive balance between competitors.","start":200.573,"stop":226.777,"duration":26.2},{"text":"It said that Borden was a large and powerful concern compared to its competitors and if the price structure which it was utilizing had placed a severe strain on small competitors, one it going out of business and all the others lost large and important accounts on a permanent basis.","start":226.777,"stop":243.894,"duration":17.12},{"text":"They found finally in this market setting that there was a clear threat to the entire Midwest competition if the discrimination were to be continued, and that the elimination or serious impairment of competition was likely.","start":243.894,"stop":259.892,"duration":16},{"text":"At the secondary line, the Commission found that there was large price differences between the competing customers, one in particularly to the Columbia, South Carolina area which is an area close to one of the Borden plants since Borden sold the private label milk at an FOB plant price whereas it sold the Borden brand milk at a delivered price, uniform throughout the United States.","start":259.892,"stop":287.381,"duration":27.49},{"text":"Now this in compared prices around the Borden plant, the Court -- the Commission found that there was a large discrepancy among customers.","start":287.381,"stop":296.496,"duration":9.12},{"text":"They found that there was a low or nonexistent profit margin in the sale of evaporated milk.","start":296.496,"stop":302.648,"duration":6.15},{"text":"It was largely handled by distributors as an accommodation and often used as a loss leader.","start":302.648,"stop":310.326,"duration":7.68},{"text":"It found that the effect of the -- of the discrimination was therefore to draw customers away not only with respect to evaporated milk but also with respect to other items handled by the wholesalers and retailers.","start":310.326,"stop":323.292,"duration":12.97},{"text":"It pointed a testimony that a price such as that which Borden offered with the private label milk would have been a great aid to the wholesalers and retailers in meeting their competition.","start":323.292,"stop":335.026,"duration":11.73},{"text":"It should have on these points and Borden says that it never refused to sell private label milk to any customer so long as it had productive capacity available, and that is not disputed in this record.","start":335.026,"stop":347.431,"duration":12.4},{"text":"But it is also undisputed however that Borden did not disclose the availability of the private label milk to all of its Borden plant customers.","start":347.431,"stop":358.607,"duration":11.18},{"text":"It -- at page 741 of the record, there's an exhibit which is a letter from Borden's merchandizing manager for evaporated milk in which he instructs the Atlanta office of Borden that brokers are not to discuss the terms of private label milk sales with customers and that all inquiries are to be referred to the home office.","start":358.607,"stop":384.301,"duration":25.69},{"text":"And at page 826 of the record is a another letter sent out by the Borden Merchandizing Manager in which he says and this is at page 827, “We are in a position to take on a few more selected accounts.","start":384.301,"stop":402.711,"duration":18.41},{"text":"Naturally, we prefer to deal with the best and the ones that can do us the most good.","start":402.711,"stop":407.348,"duration":4.64},{"text":"We certainly don't want to end up by soliciting a bunch of peanut accounts.”","start":407.348,"stop":412.016,"duration":4.67},{"text":"Now, the Commission went on to reject the cost justification which Borden had offered on the basis of an accounting analysis and that also is not at issue.","start":412.016,"stop":425.55,"duration":13.53},{"text":"I would say that this case was very much likely in Anheuser-Busch case, at 363 U.S. because the court below here did not reach either the injury to competition or the cost justification, or even the form of the order that all of these points were raised below.","start":425.55,"stop":441.467,"duration":15.92},{"text":"What the Court did was to foreclose the inquiry at the threshold issue of whether the goods were of like grade and quality.","start":441.467,"stop":451.828,"duration":10.36},{"text":"We think this is very much like Anheuser-Busch because there the question was whether or not there was a discrimination in price?","start":451.828,"stop":458.27,"duration":6.44},{"text":"The Court said that that was a threshold issue.","start":458.27,"stop":461.505,"duration":3.24},{"text":"That there was no -- there were no over tones of business backordering out of the conclusion of the discrimination in price and that the -- it was in fact a non directive phrase.","start":461.505,"stop":474.201,"duration":12.7},{"text":"Now, we're really dealing here with the other half of that phrase because the conclusion that the goods are of like grade and quality, simply leads to the conclusion that there is discrimination in price.","start":474.201,"stop":486.095,"duration":11.89},{"text":"The questions of injury to competition and the cost justification defenses which we contend think are the important issues for this case on its facts are over beyond this threshold issue.","start":486.095,"stop":500.4,"duration":14.3}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Does that mean if you prevail the case goes back to the Court of Appeals to review

discrimination -- without the ability to find discrimination in a situation where you have a private label milk and an advertised milk, the Commission has foreclosed on the inquiry into the question of whether or not there is in fact injury to competition.","start":509.519,"stop":531.725,"duration":22.21},{"text":"But I think when I talk about the legislative history, it become apparent, this was not what Congress intended.","start":531.725,"stop":539.831,"duration":8.11},{"text":"Indeed, we think that in order to appraise the decision properly, the Court should assume that there is forbidden injury to competition here because the -- as I say the Commission found it and the Court of Appeals did not reach that issue.","start":539.831,"stop":555.537,"duration":15.71},{"text":"On the narrow issue as to whether or not that goods of like grade and quality, there is no dispute.","start":555.537,"stop":561.104,"duration":5.57},{"text":"The goods are physically identical.","start":561.104,"stop":563.079,"duration":1.97},{"text":"Goods or the milk is packed according to the Borden standards irrespective of whether it's sold as private label or Borden brand milk.","start":563.079,"stop":571.906,"duration":8.83},{"text":"It's printed exactly identical cans except for the label.","start":571.906,"stop":578.007,"duration":6.1},{"text":"The Court of Appeals found that there was an intense public demand, however, for the Borden brand milk.","start":578.007,"stop":585.191,"duration":7.18},{"text":"It noted that the Borden brand milk commands a higher price at all levels of distribution, that it is well advertised and promoted and that there is a testimony that the Borden brand -- Borden name does command great deal of consumer respect.","start":585.191,"stop":602.343,"duration":17.15},{"text":"Borden advertises it very extensively and it has the necessary consequences or at least the believed consequences of advertising that it is accepted by consumers.","start":602.343,"stop":613.393,"duration":11.05},{"text":"Now the reasoning of the Court of Appeals here was that when the labels are proven to have demonstrable, commercial significance, they “change the grade of a product.”","start":613.393,"stop":627.399,"duration":14.01},{"text":"It found that the label here had premium market value and commercial significance.","start":627.399,"stop":634.336,"duration":6.94},{"text":"It believed that Congress could not have intended that consumer preferences be ignored in determining when products maybe priced differently.","start":634.336,"stop":643.573,"duration":9.24},{"text":"It believed the Court concluded that in order to avoid price uniformity which would be in conflict with the general policies of the antitrust laws that it must necessarily recognize promotional values under the expression of like grade and quality.","start":643.573,"stop":662.52,"duration":18.95},{"text":"The Court did not focus on the language.","start":662.52,"stop":665.665,"duration":3.14},{"text":"It found no help in the legislative history.","start":665.665,"stop":668.698,"duration":3.03},{"text":"It pointed to no controlling of the case and indeed there is none.","start":668.698,"stop":673.039,"duration":4.34},{"text":"It believed that the administrative precedents were distinguishable and indeed, it found a conflict between the Commission's approached under the protection with the Section 2(b) defense that is the good faith meeting of competition defense with its approach to this case and our position briefly is that the Court was in error on virtually every one of those points.","start":673.039,"stop":698.648,"duration":25.61},{"text":"First, we think that the language is quite clearly in -- quite clearly supports the Commission's position.","start":698.648,"stop":706.277,"duration":7.63},{"text":"That when you look at the legislative history, you find indeed that Congress did have this problem presented to it and it rejected the opportunity to do what the Court of Appeals here did.","start":706.277,"stop":720.265,"duration":13.99},{"text":"Third, we think that the choice which Congress exercised makes good sense because it prevents foreclosing the inquiry before we reach the important questions to whether or not competition is injured.","start":720.265,"stop":734.891,"duration":14.63},{"text":"And finally, we think that this construction which the Commission advanced in this case is a view that it has held consistently since 1936 to change it now in our view would open the very dangerous that Congress was afraid of when it refused to make an allowance for brands when it passed the Robinson-Patman Act.","start":734.891,"stop":756.908,"duration":22.02},{"text":"And in the absence of some record that the Commission's construction to which it has adhered since 1936 and caused some kind of economic harm we think that that construction should be given great weight.","start":756.908,"stop":770.13,"duration":13.22},{"text":"Turning first to the language which we do not argue is necessarily decisive.","start":770.13,"stop":776.074,"duration":5.94},{"text":"We think nevertheless it clearly supports us.","start":776.074,"stop":780.365,"duration":4.29},{"text":"The whole notion of greater quality it seems to us is in conflict with the idea of promotional values because promotional values may very well reflect an erroneous review of the products' physical attributes and the Commission thinks that grade and quality means physical attributes.","start":780.365,"stop":799.966,"duration":19.6},{"text":"I think that we took an example, if I had two cans of milk here and they were perfectly identical and that's all we knew about them and I asked whether they were like grade and quality, I think it would be unanimously responded but of course they were of like grade and quality.","start":799.966,"stop":816.744,"duration":16.78},{"text":"If knowing just that and nothing more, I then added a label to one which said Borden and to the other which said Smiths and we were told that consumers were willing to pay more for the Borden can of milk, I think the reaction would be not that the Borden milk is of higher grade and quality but that the consumers are under misapprehension.","start":816.744,"stop":841.403,"duration":24.66},{"text":"They don't understand that physically they are the same.","start":841.403,"stop":844.015,"duration":2.61},{"text":"And Borden put in the record a survey which it conducted at page 24 and 25 of Volume 1 of the record and housewives were asked for why they -- for reasons as to why they preferred the Borden brand and if you look at those reasons, you see that they are almost unanimously physical attributes.","start":844.015,"stop":865.969,"duration":21.95},{"text":"They thought it was creamier, but it didn't have a can of taste, that it didn't sour, that they liked the flavor better, one said it was heavier, and one said it was lighter, one said it was thick and it didn't have a canny taste.","start":865.969,"stop":882.664,"duration":16.69},{"text":"Now, these are all physical attributes and what Borden is in effect asking here what the Court of Appeals rule is that we make a circle through the consumer's misapprehension that there is a difference.","start":882.664,"stop":897.349,"duration":14.69},{"text":"We are now to conclude that this changes the grade and quality and
