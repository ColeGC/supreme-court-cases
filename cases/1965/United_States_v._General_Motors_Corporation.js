enough.","start":2072.455,"stop":2075.592,"duration":3.14},{"text":"Mr. Cash indicated the policy and at that point the dealers agreed to go along with it.","start":2075.592,"stop":2082.163,"duration":6.57},{"text":"And also at the same time, General Motors made it quite clear that it was bringing this policy home to all the dealers in the
