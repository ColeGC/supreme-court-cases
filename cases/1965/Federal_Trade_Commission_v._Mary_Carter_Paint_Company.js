Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.","start":18.804,"stop":23.765,"duration":4.96},{"text":"This Federal Trade Commission case, which is here in on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit presents the question whether respondent's use of the word ‘free’ in its advertising slogans was properly held by the commission to amount to a deceptive practice within the meaning of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.","start":23.765,"stop":47.714,"duration":23.95},{"text":"The critical facts are undisputed and I shall state them briefly.","start":47.714,"stop":53.476,"duration":5.76},{"text":"Respondent began manufacturing various kinds of paints and selling it under the trade name Mary Carter in about 1950 and it now distributes its products to the public as it has done in the past through wholly owned and franchise retail stores in the Southern and Eastern sections of the country.","start":53.476,"stop":77.806,"duration":24.33},{"text":"The company has been resoundingly successful.","start":77.806,"stop":80.336,"duration":2.53},{"text":"It grew at a great rate in the first decade of its existence concededly because of the effectiveness of the advertising slogans and sales policy which had been advertised which is at issue here.","start":80.336,"stop":97.413,"duration":17.08},{"text":"Respondent's own officers in the testimony before the Federal Trade Commission called it the keystone of respondent's advertising policy.","start":97.413,"stop":107.272,"duration":9.86},{"text":"It has been so successful that in five years from 1955 to 1960 its total sales increased from slightly over $1 million annually to more than $12 million.","start":107.272,"stop":119.235,"duration":11.96},{"text":"The disputed policy is as follows.","start":119.235,"stop":122.51,"duration":3.28},{"text":"Respondent packages its paint in quart and gallon cans, but it sells to the public on terms which are succinctly stated in its two most commonly used advertising slogans, “Buy one get one free” or “Every second can of paint free”, occasionally they add to that the words “of extra cost”.","start":122.51,"stop":149.203,"duration":26.69},{"text":"Consumers are told in other words that a single quart can of Mary Carter paint sells for 225, that's the usual price most of the quart cans, but that a free can, “free” is given with every can that's purchased for 225.","start":149.203,"stop":167.476,"duration":18.27},{"text":"Similarly, respondent represents that the price of most of its one gallon cans is 698, but that a second can will be “Given free” with every 698 purchase.","start":167.476,"stop":181.286,"duration":13.81},{"text":"On these facts, the Federal Trade Commission after appropriate proceedings found with one member dissenting that the use of the word free violated Section 5 and that it impliedly misrepresented the customary and usual retail price of Mary Carter paint and it entered a cease and desist order.","start":181.286,"stop":203.759,"duration":22.47},{"text":"The Court of Appeal disagreed and they entered an order directing the commission to dismiss the complaint.","start":203.759,"stop":211.423,"duration":7.66},{"text":"I should like to turn first to the question of deception, which troubled the dissenting commissioner and the majority of the Court of Appeals and more particularly to the broader issue whether even if Mary Carter makes its entirely clear on its advertisements that this is a consistent sales policy buy one get one free or every second can free, the use of the word free is deceptive.","start":211.423,"stop":242.716,"duration":31.29},{"text":"I should say at the outset that we accept for purposes of this case Mary Carter's claim that it consistently directed its retailers, franchise dealers and wholly owned retail outlets not to sell a single can of paint at less than 698 or 225.","start":242.716,"stop":261.494,"duration":18.78},{"text":"In other words that these dealers were instructed that two cans of paint and one can of paint should bear the same price.","start":261.494,"stop":270.514,"duration":9.02},{"text":"The question is whether under these circumstances the commission could find that it was deceptive to call the second can free.","start":270.514,"stop":279.161,"duration":8.65},{"text":"Now there can hardly be any doubt I would think that the word free or any language carrying that kind of meaning is a very potent attraction to consumers and buyers.","start":279.161,"stop":289.781,"duration":10.62},{"text":"It makes them buy maybe out of what Judge Brown and his concurring opinion call a habit of self delusion as to free products.","start":289.781,"stop":300.876,"duration":11.09},{"text":"If buyers are likely to be mislead by Mary Carter's use of the word free into thinking that they are being given a bonus that they are not actually receiving and if they then buy that can or that product of paint rather than a competing product because of that reason, the representation if it is false or misleading may certainly be prevented by the commission.","start":300.876,"stop":326.956,"duration":26.08},{"text":"The representation is misleading in this case we submit simply because the word free as used by Mary Carter means nothing more that the company is chosen to call one can of a two can package free and has chosen to attach to the other cans the full retail sales price.","start":326.956,"stop":348.08,"duration":21.12},{"text":"If it's sales policy is stripped of the Mary Carter slogan, then it's obvious that what all that the company is doing is it's selling paints in combination packages of two cans and it is charging for the two cans what is in effect a two can price.","start":348.08,"stop":367.534,"duration":19.45}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"So it would be relevant as to what paint of equal quality, sold a competitive paint of equal quality, but it’s sold for whether it was around about $2.25 a quart or whether it was closer $4 a can or a $1.15?","start":367.534,"stop":384.894,"duration":17.36}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"No, Mr. Justice Stewart.","start":384.894,"stop":388.716,"duration":3.82},{"text":"In the commission's opinion and we submit that was right, the quality of the paint was irrelevant.","start":388.716,"stop":395.471,"duration":6.75},{"text":"The commission examiner excluded testimony regarding --","start":395.471,"stop":398.444,"duration":2.97}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"I was asking about the price for paint of competitive quality?","start":398.444,"stop":405.393,"duration":6.95}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, the price of paint of competitive quality is I think irrelevant as to question of whether Mary Carter's own sales policy is deceptive, in other words the fact that Mary Carter paint maybe equal to paint of 698 quality or maybe better or worse doesn't we submit entitle it to call one of two cans that it sells free.","start":405.393,"stop":431.803,"duration":26.41},{"text":"It may justify Mary Carter in setting its price at 698 and advertising to the public, we are giving you paint that's as good as 698 paint or setting the price of 349 a can and advertising to the public, our paint it is good as 698 quality paint at 349.","start":431.803,"stop":449.437,"duration":17.63},{"text":"So you are getting double your value.","start":449.437,"stop":451.284,"duration":1.85}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Was there any evidence on this subject in the record?","start":451.284,"stop":455.582,"duration":4.3}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Mary Carter attempted to introduce evidence into of the record that their paint was equal in quality to competitor’s paint selling at 698.","start":455.582,"stop":464.176,"duration":8.59}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Per gallon.","start":464.176,"stop":464.912,"duration":0.74}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Per gallon and the examiner excluded that.","start":464.912,"stop":468.825,"duration":3.91},{"text":"Now for purposes of the case at the present juncture we're willing to accept for our arguments sake that the paint is as good as other paint of 698 quality and that Mary Carter maybe able to truthfully to represent that it is as good as other paint of 698 quality.","start":468.825,"stop":485.71,"duration":16.88},{"text":"Well of course these are the kinds of things that consumers choices maybe determined by in terms of quality, in other words Mary Carter can sell its paint at any price it chooses and claim that it is of a certain quality and the consumers are free to believe or disbelieve that.","start":485.71,"stop":503.772,"duration":18.06},{"text":"All the commission says is that they may not set as six -- therefore claim that another can is being sold free.","start":503.772,"stop":512.495,"duration":8.72}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"(Inaudible)","start":512.495,"stop":521.934,"duration":9.44}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that's covered by the commission's order and properly so Mr. Justice Harlan, I think that gives the consumer the very same impression -- they could say the two cans for 698 and you can't get less.","start":521.934,"stop":537.1,"duration":15.17}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Lewin suppose Mary Carter had sold it's paint at these same prices for a year let's say -- and then for the succeeding year, two years or however you may want to vary it, had made this special offer, what would the government's position be as to the theory applicable there?","start":537.1,"stop":569.011,"duration":31.91}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"The commission I believe would say that, that is proper so long as the offer is a limited time offer, in other words it will ultimately within a reasonable time, I don't think the commission would allow this to go on for a year or two, but if it's a one month offer or a two month offer and the price then would go back to 698 per gallon and two gallons would sell in effect $14, then that would be a fair representation to consumers for that limited period they are in effect receiving a bonus which they can't receive when the offer does not exist.","start":569.011,"stop":605.696,"duration":36.69}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"And why would that be misleading, suppose Mary Carter said, we just don't want to do that in the Federal Trade Commission, we want to sell this one.","start":605.696,"stop":614.643,"duration":8.95},{"text":"Why is that misleading in one case and not misleading in the other?","start":614.643,"stop":619.568,"duration":4.92}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"If there is no time limit put on the duration of the offer, then a buyer who sees the advertisement is being deceived because he thinks that the seller has and intends to have in the future a regular price for the one can.","start":619.568,"stop":637.418,"duration":17.85},{"text":"If Mary Carter decided he is going to do it, in effect intermittently, then it has no intention of selling a single can any longer at 698, it will be selling into the future two cans for 698.","start":637.418,"stop":652.021,"duration":14.6}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"But this couldn't rise that regular price issue, that's another problem, isn't it?","start":652.021,"stop":657.055,"duration":5.03},{"text":"All it says is, is you buy, all these ads say you is that you buy one can and you get another can free.","start":657.055,"stop":665.43,"duration":8.38},{"text":"Now it doesn't make any -- or am I wrong about this, do they make any representations about buy one can at the regular price and get another can free?","start":665.43,"stop":676.907,"duration":11.48},{"text":"Is there any such representation here?","start":676.907,"stop":679.076,"duration":2.17}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan

explicit.","start":681.42,"stop":683.306,"duration":1.89}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Not explicit Mr. Justice Fortas.","start":683.306,"stop":688.858,"duration":5.55},{"text":"In effect, that the slogan buy one, get one free or every second can free is misleading in two related respects really.","start":688.858,"stop":697.831,"duration":8.97},{"text":"When a consumer is told buy one, then he assumes, as he has every right to assume that buy one means buy one at the price of one and then you get the second can free.","start":697.831,"stop":711.222,"duration":13.39},{"text":"When in effect, Mary Carter has a consistent policy of selling two for what is purportedly -- it's price for one, then the consumer is not buying one at the price of one, he is buying one and getting an additional can for the price of two.","start":711.222,"stop":729.345,"duration":18.12},{"text":"In effect both buy one and every second can free mean the same as two for the price of one.","start":729.345,"stop":740.148,"duration":10.8},{"text":"Respondent in its brief in this Court claims that it has never advertised two for the price of one.","start":740.148,"stop":745.703,"duration":5.55},{"text":"But the representations are indistinguishable, every second can free means that you're getting two cans for the price of one.","start":745.703,"stop":753.501,"duration":7.8},{"text":"And when Mary Carter sets its price in effect at a price for two it is no longer giving two for the price of one.","start":753.501,"stop":764.77,"duration":11.27},{"text":"Now, even if the advertisement had added to it, the caveat that this is a permanent policy of the company, that doesn't in any way avoid the misrepresentation.","start":764.77,"stop":777.851,"duration":13.08},{"text":"Saying to consumers we always give everyone a second can free, is self contradictory.","start":777.851,"stop":785.952,"duration":8.1},{"text":"The only way you can translate the words we always give everyone a second can free into comprehensible English, is to say that it means we always sell our product in two can packages.","start":785.952,"stop":797.211,"duration":11.26},{"text":"And if that's what Mary Carter is doing then the commission's order on this case just requires it to say that and not use the words free.","start":797.211,"stop":805.785,"duration":8.57},{"text":"Now, it's true that a buyer who stops to think and can puzzle out the meaning that we always give everyone a second can free may be able to discover after considerable thought that this just means a two for the price of two policy.","start":805.785,"stop":823.653,"duration":17.87}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"(Inaudible)","start":823.653,"stop":830.536,"duration":6.88}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan

Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"They don't do it in quite the same size as the buy one get one free, but there are several advertisements in the record here in which, Mary Carter does in small print state that it is and will be its consistent policy to sell this at this -- on these terms.","start":833.883,"stop":856.01,"duration":22.13},{"text":"There is one in which Mary Carter, reportedly the woman who is in-charge of the corporation says that she tells her Board of Directors every year, that we should start selling -- the Board of Directors tells her that we should start selling paint at half price and she responds to them no I'll never do that.","start":856.01,"stop":875.945,"duration":19.94},{"text":"Now even if that were to bring across to consumer the message that this is not a limited time offer, but that it will be available into the foreseeable future, nonetheless we contend all it does is confuse and puzzle consumers and they can only assume that there is some bonus being hidden in here some place and then they go out and buy the product, whereas actually there is no bonus there at all.","start":875.945,"stop":905.907,"duration":29.96},{"text":"An illustration of the fact that there is nothing here that's really free, may serve to demonstrate the point more clearly.","start":905.907,"stop":914.957,"duration":9.05},{"text":"If I have a dozen oranges that I want to sell for $0.50 for example.","start":914.957,"stop":918.99,"duration":4.03},{"text":"I can list the sale price a dozen oranges for $0.50 or I can advertise that I am prepared to sell six of them for $0.50 and give away one free with every orange I sell.","start":918.99,"stop":930.125,"duration":11.13},{"text":"Now of course the six free oranges aren't free in any sense other, than that I attach that word to those six oranges.","start":930.125,"stop":937.507,"duration":7.38},{"text":"The consumer is really -- has no reason to buy my product rather than someone else's because I'm just not giving him anything in the way of a bonus.","start":937.507,"stop":949.932,"duration":12.43},{"text":"Or in effect, what Mary Carter is doing here is the same as if anybody who sold product in pairs, a manufacturer of socks would advertise that he'd sell one sock and give the other one free.","start":949.932,"stop":965.141,"duration":15.21},{"text":"Or a haberdasher would say I'm selling only the coats and the trousers are being given away free.","start":965.141,"stop":971.727,"duration":6.59},{"text":"Of course, nothing is given away free there, these products are being sold in pairs.","start":971.727,"stop":976.291,"duration":4.56}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"I should be -- I hope you are going to get to the distinction between this and the practice

Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"The commission distinguished between Mary Carter's use of the word free, and the use of that word in cases like Black and Book-of-the-Month club on the ground that in those cases, the product being sold had a usual and customary or usual and regular price.","start":992.591,"stop":1009.955,"duration":17.36},{"text":"This distinction, we believe was sound, because when there is an established price for what we call the tying items, in other words the product that has to be purchased as a condition for receiving the supposed free item, neither of the two misrepresentations that we've previously discussed, neither the misrepresentation as to usual and customary price nor the representation that something is being given away free has actually been made.","start":1009.955,"stop":1044.089,"duration":34.13},{"text":"The word free under those circumstances has an objectively ascertainable meaning and entirely apart from the seller's own manipulations of his product, a purchaser can honestly conclude entirely on his own that he is receiving something as a bonus.","start":1044.089,"stop":1063.074,"duration":18.99},{"text":"The simplest case of course in which some is free is when it's given when it's given with no strings attached.","start":1063.074,"stop":1068.322,"duration":5.25},{"text":"But if the condition of obtaining the free item is the purchase of another product, the commission has held that it can still be meaningfully free if there is a standard, objective standard for comparing the offer being made, either to -- at a limited time or to a limited group of people, with what is the practice when the offer is not in existence.","start":1068.322,"stop":1090.183,"duration":21.86},{"text":"In other words, if a buyer can say to himself, I had to pay $0.25 for item X last week or others who are not in my special class had to pay $0.25 for item X.","start":1090.183,"stop":1105.898,"duration":15.71},{"text":"And either this week or because I am in a particular class, I am able to obtain both items X and Y for $0.25, then he is getting something free in a meaningful sense.","start":1105.898,"stop":1118.736,"duration":12.84},{"text":"He is getting something which he could not obtain at some other time or which other people who are not in his position would not be able to obtain.","start":1118.736,"stop":1128.862,"duration":10.13},{"text":"Now that's the distinction which the commission made between this case and the Book-of-the-Month Club and Black.","start":1128.862,"stop":1135.664,"duration":6.8},{"text":"In both Black and Book-of-the-Month the offer was being made to new enrollees only.","start":1135.664,"stop":1141.606,"duration":5.94},{"text":"In other words they were told, if you sign up in our book club you will receive free a certain number of books on the condition that you purchase certain others.","start":1141.606,"stop":1152.049,"duration":10.44},{"text":"Now, the other members of the club who were not new members, were not able to obtain the very same offer, they could buy all the books which were being sold as a condition for receiving the free premium and yet they would receive no free premium at all.","start":1152.049,"stop":1170.644,"duration":18.6},{"text":"So that the limited class of people to whom the offer was directed were in effect receiving something free in some sense other than merely the seller's own arrangement of his -- of products sold in a package.","start":1170.644,"stop":1188.945,"duration":18.3},{"text":"It's not as if the seller was just saying, I will call something free because I'll throw it into the package at the same price.","start":1188.945,"stop":1197.151,"duration":8.21},{"text":"He was in effect saying only if you were in that class, can you

one.","start":1204.844,"stop":1227.116,"duration":22.27},{"text":"Number two, you tell us that the examiner excluded evidence as to other products.","start":1227.116,"stop":1236.97,"duration":9.85},{"text":"Number three, perhaps I'd better ask you this, is there any dispute with respect to the assertion that the selling price is more

are in effect saying I take it is that there is only one way that you can have a non-misleading free offer and that is if the precise product has previously been sold at the stipulated price, is that right?","start":1257.237,"stop":1275.504,"duration":18.27},{"text":"But that if it's -- if there is any other standard, if it's misleading, it seems that's perhaps an incorrect way to state your argument, and I would like to hear you elaborate on it.","start":1275.504,"stop":1295.529,"duration":20.03}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"I think Mr. Justice Fortas it's broader than just it having been previously offered at that price, it has to be offered at that price in the usual course, meaning either previously or maybe after the offer is terminated.","start":1295.529,"stop":1309.948,"duration":14.42},{"text":"In other words, there could be an introductory free offer.","start":1309.948,"stop":1312.557,"duration":2.61},{"text":"When a product first comes on the market and a manufacturer has the intention of selling it at a given price, he can attach something to it at the outset and say this is free.","start":1312.557,"stop":1323.949,"duration":11.39},{"text":"Or it could be an offer made to -- an offer or unlimited in time, made to only a limited class of people which is in effect what Black and Book-of-the-Month Club were.","start":1323.949,"stop":1339.573,"duration":15.62},{"text":"The significance of that is that, that really communicates a bona fide message to the consumer which should affect his purchasing choice, in other words a consumer can say, if I can obtain a premium or a bonus for this month, whereas as I couldn't at other times or I can obtain it because I am in a special class, where these other people aren't, he should buy on that account but he shouldn't buy because the buyer just says I am pegging my package and I am splitting it in half and I am calling it
