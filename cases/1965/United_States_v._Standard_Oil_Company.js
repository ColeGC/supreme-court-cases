into the river.","start":793.564,"stop":818.482,"duration":24.92},{"text":"But when -- if Congress was concerned, as we think the statute clearly indicates with negligent conduct as well as with willful conduct, then it makes far more sense to look at the results because people after all are negligent with property that they considered valuable to them just as they may be with property that
