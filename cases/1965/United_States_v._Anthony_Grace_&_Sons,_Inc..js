some time.","start":323.669,"stop":330.288,"duration":6.62},{"text":"Ultimately, the Air Force contracting officer took the position that there had not been such a variance in the area to which the new higher rates were applicable and that accordingly the contractor was not entitled to an increase in the contract price on that account.","start":330.288,"stop":353.081,"duration":22.79},{"text":"He therefore demanded Grace that it comply with the closing date and enter into the

untimely.","start":401.659,"stop":406.715,"duration":5.06},{"text":"We needn't discuss the reasons for that decision because it is no longer

Claims.","start":415.517,"stop":424.248,"duration":8.73},{"text":"The Court of Claims held that the appeal was timely, that the Board should have had the case on merits, that the government's motion for summary judgment predicated on the theory that in no event was the default justified even if the adjustment in the bid price might have been erroneously denied, was at least tentatively denied and the Court of Claims remanded the case to its trial commissioner, for trail.","start":424.248,"stop":460.629,"duration":36.38},{"text":"Now, it's maybe helpful to isolate the questions as they were presented to the Court of Claims even though those questions were not here.","start":460.629,"stop":471.675,"duration":11.05},{"text":"The government's first position was that Grace's claim in the court was barred because it did fail to exhaust his administrative remedies in that it had not timely appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals.","start":471.675,"stop":487.166,"duration":15.49},{"text":"As I have said, that position of the government was flatly rejected by the Court of Claims and we do not challenge the decision of the Court of Claims on that point.","start":487.166,"stop":498.717,"duration":11.55},{"text":"The Government's second position was that the claim stated no cause of action on which relief could be granted because in the circumstances, even if the failure to allow an increased price was unjustified, nevertheless Grace's proper recourse was to go to the Board not to default as it did.","start":498.717,"stop":523.635,"duration":24.92},{"text":"Again, the Court of Claims at least tentatively moved against the Government on this issue to deny the Government's motion for summary judgment which was in part predicated on that theory and again we did not petition from that decision of the Court of Claims and therefore do not challenge it here.","start":523.635,"stop":546.93,"duration":23.29},{"text":"Now finally, and this is the only issue that is still in the case as it appears here.","start":546.93,"stop":552.888,"duration":5.96},{"text":"Again, this issue is not a resolution by this Court is whether the contractor was in fact justified, the assumption that there might some justifications, in defaulting rather than awaiting a resolution of his dispute about whether or not, he was entitled to an increased price in light of the new determinations of wages by the Secretary of Labor.","start":552.888,"stop":583.658,"duration":30.77},{"text":"Because the Court of Claims impliedly ruled at least that this question was an open one and because it ruled clearly that the question should be determined in light of the underlying facts that a factual record should be made before the question would be decided.","start":583.658,"stop":608.812,"duration":25.15},{"text":"It held that a trial was necessary.","start":608.812,"stop":612.461,"duration":3.65},{"text":"Now the resolution of that issue will determine whether the contractor was excused from the normal penalty of default which is forfeiture of this deposit and conceivably whether the Government's action was so unwarranted to entitle him to additional damages.","start":612.461,"stop":638.1,"duration":25.64},{"text":"Now the issue in this Court, as I've said, does not relate to the denial of the motion for summary judgment.","start":638.1,"stop":646.689,"duration":8.59},{"text":"We did not petition on that issue.","start":646.689,"stop":649.741,"duration":3.05},{"text":"We accept the ruling of the Court of Claims that there are factual issues that must be determined somewhere, that a factual record must be made before the ultimate legal issue is decided.","start":649.741,"stop":663.724,"duration":13.98},{"text":"Our only quarrel is with respect to where that factual finding should be made, where the record should be made in the first instance.","start":663.724,"stop":676.567,"duration":12.84},{"text":"We say that it must be made before the administrative board and not in the Court itself.","start":676.567,"stop":684.015,"duration":7.45},{"text":"Now it seems to us that the Bianchi case squarely controls this question.","start":684.015,"stop":690.817,"duration":6.8},{"text":"The thrust of that decision is clearly that factual disputes arising out of a contract of this kind should, in the first instance, be resolved administratively.","start":690.817,"stop":703.607,"duration":12.79},{"text":"The only question here is whether the rule is any different because the Board had once erroneously refused to entertain the dispute.","start":703.607,"stop":716.308,"duration":12.7},{"text":"Now again Bianchi, it seems to us, answers that question.","start":716.308,"stop":722.599,"duration":6.29},{"text":"The Court said in that case that if the administrative record is inadequate or if the Board has committed some error, still the Court should stay its hand, correct the error, and while it had no power to remand, it should stay the proceedings in the Court awaiting a correction of that error by the Board or a completion of the record in further board proceedings.","start":722.599,"stop":754.041,"duration":31.44},{"text":"That rule it seems to us is fully appropriate in this case.","start":754.041,"stop":759.961,"duration":5.92},{"text":"It's important to stress I think that the Board here has not refused to decide the underlying dispute because it thought it lacked jurisdiction to do so.","start":759.961,"stop":770.608,"duration":10.65},{"text":"It's simply erroneously thought the appeal was untimely and for that reason and that reason alone, it did not resolved it.","start":770.608,"stop":781.243,"duration":10.64},{"text":"Accordingly, there's no reason to believe that it will not resolve the dispute if given an opportunity to do so.","start":781.243,"stop":789.138,"duration":7.89},{"text":"Indeed, the Board's opinion gives a rather clear indication in that direction.","start":789.138,"stop":797.293,"duration":8.15},{"text":"It says with apparent approval and I'm reading from page 36 of the record, at the bottom of the page, \"The parties are in complete agreement that it was and is their mutual interpretation that in the event of a timely appeal -- in the event a timely appeal is taken thereunder, the disputes paragraph' of the Letter of Acceptability confers jurisdiction on the Board to review a decision relating to cancellation of commitments, withholding of bid security, and itemization and determination of actual damages.\"","start":797.293,"stop":834.081,"duration":36.79},{"text":"In light of that, there is certainly no reason to suppose, the Board will fail to determine the controversy if given the chance to
