true.","start":323.851,"stop":332.634,"duration":8.78},{"text":"He said that the Police Chief had a policeman in his staff who sympathized with the striking miners and that man had had his life

general verdict to guilty by the jury.","start":424.702,"stop":427.86,"duration":3.16},{"text":"And there was no indication of whether they find him guilty of libeling the Sheriff or the Police Chief or Mrs. Nolan.","start":427.86,"stop":434.037,"duration":6.18},{"text":"That wasn't separately stated or made clear.","start":434.037,"stop":439.599,"duration":5.56},{"text":"And point of fact there

proof.","start":439.599,"stop":452.375,"duration":12.78},{"text":"Now, the criminal law -- criminal libel law of Kentucky as it's construed in this case by Kentucky's highest court, we submit is unconstitutional.","start":452.375,"stop":465.478,"duration":13.1},{"text":"Now, the entire law we state, not as it's applied in this case but the law itself is we think clearly unconstitutional

libeled.","start":465.478,"stop":493.163,"duration":27.69},{"text":"It punishes as a crime, speech that doesn't in anyway affect the public or the community or the

Attorney General's brief, just a moment at page 16, he states that it's admitted that some defamatory publications at it's lowest which could be punished as a crime would not be serious in impact as others.","start":535.136,"stop":561.973,"duration":26.84},{"text":"And then he goes on to say, “It is admitted that the Kentucky common law offense is designed to protect individual reputation.","start":561.973,"stop":577.951,"duration":15.98},{"text":"And a similar statement is made on page 3 of his
