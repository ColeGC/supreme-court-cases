is merely dismissed because of a lack of evidence.","start":957.488,"stop":962.474,"duration":4.99},{"text":"However in the special circumstances of this case, the General Counsel's rulings coupled with that of the Board itself that the engineers were supervisors does have final legal significance because the General Counsel's ruling meant explicitly that Section 8 (b) (7) of the Act which regulates primary recognition picketing where employees are involved cannot be applied because in essential element for that section of the Act to apply is the presence of employees and the engineers were supervisors.","start":962.474,"stop":998.474,"duration":36},{"text":"Consequently, this ruling by the General Counsel did have final legal significance in that.","start":998.474,"stop":1006.533,"duration":8.06},{"text":"It said that the Board could never reach the primary recognition picketing of supervisors under the Act because the Act did not apply

in the case of this type.","start":1018.07,"stop":1034.339,"duration":16.27},{"text":"Secondary activity which is left to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board is something more than primary picketing.","start":1034.339,"stop":1043.545,"duration":9.21},{"text":"It amounts to activity which is calculated to urge neutral employees of secondary employers to cease working for their employer in an effort to put pressure on the primary employer and this of course is something more than primary picketing.","start":1043.545,"stop":1066.172,"duration":22.63},{"text":"The two activities can exist simultaneously but they're separable.","start":1066.172,"stop":1072.277,"duration":6.11},{"text":"Consequently, the primary picketing could be left in the case of recognition picketing of supervisors to the jurisdiction of the state court and the secondary activity could remain within the jurisdiction of the Board to be regulated if there is any such activity.","start":1072.277,"stop":1094.99,"duration":22.71},{"text":"It would not advance the policies of the Act to deny the state court's jurisdiction of the primary recognition picketing for the Act does not extend to such activity.","start":1094.99,"stop":1107.965,"duration":12.97},{"text":"The National Labor Relations Board perceives no encroachment upon its jurisdiction if this course were followed.","start":1107.965,"stop":1117.161,"duration":9.2},{"text":"A parallel situation arises in the primary picketing of foreign vessels usually ship picketing occurs at a common situs when the ship is tied up to a dock.","start":1117.161,"stop":1127.284,"duration":10.12},{"text":"The common situs includes many employers other than the shipowner.","start":1127.284,"stop":1133.698,"duration":6.41},{"text":"By the decision of this Court in the Incres case, it was held that the National Labor Relations Act is not applicable to foreign ships and their crews.","start":1133.698,"stop":1144.044,"duration":10.35},{"text":"Consequently, state courts have commenced regulating the primary picketing of such foreign vessels and the Courts of Wisconsin have also done so.","start":1144.044,"stop":1154.649,"duration":10.6},{"text":"In the meanwhile, it is arguable that there might be secondary boycott activity connected with the picketing of such foreign vessels and if such activity exist then arguably, at least, it would be but within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board because even though the shipowner may not be subject to the Act there maybe many other employers within that common situs who are subject to the Act and who maybe affected and anyone affected by the secondary boycott activity would give the Board and its General Counsel the right to take action.","start":1154.649,"stop":1197.694,"duration":43.05},{"text":"Since state jurisdiction in the foreign ship picketing cases does exist side by side with arguable NLRB jurisdiction, the causes of action have as a practical matter have been shown to be separable and can be acted upon by the state and the National Labor Relations Board as the
