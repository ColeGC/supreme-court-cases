profitable sale and a reporting of capital gain on the sale of that asset.","start":629.444,"stop":663.711,"duration":34.27},{"text":"The Commissioner incorporated this committee report into the -- or

I can determine, sometime in 1960, the Commissioner privately determine that he would like to wipe the slate clean.","start":803.987,"stop":813.118,"duration":9.13},{"text":"He didn't tell us this until 1962.","start":813.118,"stop":815.565,"duration":2.45},{"text":"In June of that year, he published a Revenue Ruling that stated that now he did not want to allow depreciation for the year of profitable sale.","start":815.565,"stop":826.349,"duration":10.78},{"text":"But since our case was docketed in the Tax Court late in 1960 and from such other evidence as I can find, 1960 or about the

published rulings not only state that depreciation is allowable in the year of sale, they tell us why.","start":930.866,"stop":939.522,"duration":8.66},{"text":"Secondly, the Commissioner cannot excuse 47 years of administrative practice, published rulings, court decisions, congressional re-enactment, committee reports, regulations, and equity essences in court decisions on the ground that his eyesight wasn't good.","start":939.522,"stop":960.429,"duration":20.91},{"text":"He cannot just wave the magic wand of shortsightedness and dismiss what otherwise obviously has produced a rule of
