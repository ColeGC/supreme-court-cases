propositions which we think are governing.","start":661.85,"stop":670.189,"duration":8.34},{"text":"In the first place, that the clause invoked by the government, the invocation is not determinative, the government cannot make out a case under the fraud clause simply by saying it would like to do so.","start":670.189,"stop":682.354,"duration":12.17},{"text":"Simply by saying conspiracy-to-defraud, that's not enough.","start":682.354,"stop":685.535,"duration":3.18},{"text":"You must look through to the substance of the charge to see whether fraud is indeed there.","start":685.535,"stop":690.762,"duration":5.23},{"text":"And the second thing that Bridges case held was that if the unlawful element in the conspiracy is indeed a statutory offense, then it

conspiracy-to-defraud the government by making a false statement and a naturalization proceeding and the Court held that default statement in the naturalization proceeding is itself statutory offense

barred.","start":775.098,"stop":794.68,"duration":19.58},{"text":"That is I think with all respect is the precise holding of the case.","start":794.68,"stop":799.318,"duration":4.64},{"text":"Now, applying that here, and may it please the Court, the statute involved here is 18 U.S. Code 1001.","start":799.318,"stop":809.283,"duration":9.97},{"text":"The only unlawful thing that the defendants are charged with doing here is agreeing to file and indeed filing false affidavits.","start":809.283,"stop":819.337,"duration":10.05},{"text":"If no affidavits have been filed, there would be no

unlawful element in the whole picture here is the charge that these affidavits were false.","start":825.959,"stop":832.785,"duration":6.83},{"text":"Now, this Court has twice said and the lower federal courts have repeatedly held that under 18 U.S. Code 1001 fraud is not an essential element.","start":832.785,"stop":844.407,"duration":11.62},{"text":"This came up for a recent consideration in the Grainger case which was just argued together with Bridges and decided at the same time and the Court in the Grainger case, speaking through Mr. Justice Burton, drew the distinction between the

element.","start":844.407,"stop":879.524,"duration":35.12},{"text":"Therefore, and as I say, there are many lower court cases holding the same thing that fraud is not an element under the False Statements Act, we say here that the government has indeed endeavored to charge a conspiracy-to-defraud.","start":879.524,"stop":893.475,"duration":13.95},{"text":"They have tried to invoke that clause, but all they have actually done is charge a conspiracy to violate 1001 and fraud is not an element of that statute anymore than it was of the statute in Bridges case.","start":893.475,"stop":908.466,"duration":14.99},{"text":"Now, may I point out one other quite relevant factor here, this case is I think a clearer one for the dismissal of this indictment than was Bridges.","start":908.466,"stop":921.326,"duration":12.86},{"text":"In the Bridges case, one could and indeed the Government did argue that the United States have relied on the truth of the statement.","start":921.326,"stop":933.26,"duration":11.93},{"text":"The statement alleged to be false there was that Bridges in the course of naturalization proceeding was asked whether he had been a member of the Communist Party and said no.","start":933.26,"stop":942.815,"duration":9.56},{"text":"And the Government's position was that in reliance on that denial, the Government naturalized him.","start":942.815,"stop":952.14,"duration":9.32},{"text":"That cannot be argued here because in point of fact, the National Labor Relations Board did not rely on the truth of this affidavit.","start":952.14,"stop":960.764,"duration":8.62},{"text":"The initial procedure before the Board was indeed that they would pass on the truth or falsity of these affidavits, but Your Honors

followed whether or not the affidavit was false or true.","start":960.764,"stop":987.213,"duration":26.45},{"text":"Indeed, the prosecution for filing a false affidavit could follow, but noncompliance did not follow.","start":987.213,"stop":994.867,"duration":7.65},{"text":"Therefore, nothing so far as the Board was concerned hang-on the truth or falsity of these affidavits and there was therefore

is.","start":1062.009,"stop":1068.458,"duration":6.45},{"text":"If all that has been done here is to charge the defendants with conspiracy to commit an offense, and the Government addresses that up

States.","start":2703.125,"stop":2723.227,"duration":20.1},{"text":"Second, petitioners have argued that their convictions are unconstitutional because Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act which

offense to commit to United States under 18 U.S.C 3288 which authorizes re-indictment in case of a flaw in the indictment after the lapse of limitations period and there would then be a new
