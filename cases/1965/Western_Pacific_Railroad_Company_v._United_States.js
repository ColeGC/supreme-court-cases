routes, which are directly competitive one with the other.","start":91.309,"stop":109.07,"duration":17.76},{"text":"These two routes are the Southern Pacific between Portland and Los Angeles which are shown in Brown and its connection with the Santa Fe from Stockton South to Los Angeles on one hand and the so-called, Bieber route which is made up of the purple Great Northern from Portland to Bieber, the Western Pacific in red from Bieber to the Stockton, San Francisco, Oakland Bay area and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe in green south to Los Angeles.","start":109.07,"stop":149.159,"duration":40.09},{"text":"Both routes extend between Southern California and Portland, Oregon and both routes physically connect with Railroad appellees at Portland.","start":149.159,"stop":162.407,"duration":13.25},{"text":"Both routes served the same general territory in this area and all major shipping points.","start":162.407,"stop":171.957,"duration":9.55},{"text":"The Bieber route was under the specific authorization of the Interstate Commerce Commission completed in 1931.","start":171.957,"stop":184.021,"duration":12.06},{"text":"As described, it consists now as it did then of the end-to-end connections of the three specifically described railroads.","start":184.021,"stop":195.215,"duration":11.19},{"text":"Southern Pacific route was constructed first and for almost 20 years was the only north-south rail route in this territory.","start":195.215,"stop":209.053,"duration":13.84},{"text":"The construction of the Bieber route was for the declared and avowed purpose of establishing for the first time a service fully competitive with the event existing Southern Pacific route.","start":209.053,"stop":224.855,"duration":15.8},{"text":"Railroad appellees which served the territory North to Portland up in Oregon, Washington and Western Idaho by establishing and maintaining a full line of through service rates with Southern Pacific via Portland while at the same time refusing to enter into similar arrangements with the Bieber route have forted and frustrated the competition between these two routes.","start":224.855,"stop":258.317,"duration":33.46},{"text":"With the result that on all traffic moving to or from the appellee's territory, the Southern Pacific has a virtual monopoly as a practical manner than using one of the many illustrations, which appear in the record.","start":258.317,"stop":278.186,"duration":19.87},{"text":"If the shipper at Seattle located on the lines of Railroad appellees, make the shipment from Seattle destined to San Francisco, California and the discrimination did not exist, we would be fully competitive at Portland for the movement south from the point of common interchange.","start":278.186,"stop":304.912,"duration":26.73},{"text":"But because of the rate discrimination, the shipment must move South of Portland on the Southern Pacific route even if it is destined to an industry served exclusively by the Western Pacific Railroad in the San Francisco area.","start":304.912,"stop":323.758,"duration":18.85},{"text":"And the same situation prevails in the opposite direction.","start":323.758,"stop":330.265,"duration":6.51},{"text":"The need for competitive service, which in 1931 required establishment of the Bieber route, is manifestly more pronounced today.","start":330.265,"stop":345.446,"duration":15.18},{"text":"In January of this year, the Interstate Commerce Commission rejected the separate efforts of both Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe to take stock control of Western Pacific pointing to among other factors the critical need of Western Pacific to remain as an independent effective competitor of Southern Pacific Company with particular emphasis on its operations via the Bieber route.","start":345.446,"stop":382.391,"duration":36.94},{"text":"The division -- the decision of the Commission also pointed to the relative ineffectiveness of the competition provided in this territory by other modes or forms of transportation.","start":382.391,"stop":398.871,"duration":16.48},{"text":"Efforts to abate the discrimination have been unavailing because both the Commission, contrary to the findings of its hearing officer, and the lower court determined that Western Pacific was not a connecting line with appellees, because one, it is not the partner in the Bieber route which enjoys the physical connection with appellees at Portland, and in the alternative Western Pacific does not now have by grace of railroad appellees what they have classified as a business connection with them.","start":398.871,"stop":444.591,"duration":45.72},{"text":"Both the Commission and lower court rely upon Atlantic Coast Line versus United

does not require any liberalization of the present interpretation of the term connecting lines to so hold.","start":477.94,"stop":488.419,"duration":10.48},{"text":"Not only is this so under the doctrine of Atlantic Coastline but under every other pronouncement of this Court on the subject and especially under the decision in Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville Railroad versus United States.","start":488.419,"stop":505.328,"duration":16.91},{"text":"After the Commission hearing examiner in this case had heard all of the evidence first hand.","start":505.328,"stop":513.674,"duration":8.35},{"text":"He cut through all of the extraneous argument and held for Western Pacific in what we believe are simple, clear and positive findings.","start":513.674,"stop":524.429,"duration":10.75},{"text":"His summation at page 654 of the record herein was and I quote, \"There is no justification in this record for such treatment of a connecting line.","start":524.429,"stop":536.302,"duration":11.87},{"text":"The granting of a full line of rates to one railroad and an interchange point while at the same time limiting the extent of such rates to the favored lines' competitor is the essence of discrimination.","start":536.302,"stop":552.296,"duration":15.99},{"text":"It is the type of unlawful discrimination Section 3 (4) of the Act aims to prevent.\"","start":552.296,"stop":561.765,"duration":9.47},{"text":"The appellant's definition of a connecting line comports with a clear legislative intent and is fully consistent with this Court's repeated their determination that and I quote from page 594 of the Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville decision, \"Wherever discrimination is in fact practiced an order to remove it may issue and the order may extend to every carrier who participates in inflicting the injury.\"","start":561.765,"stop":595.769,"duration":34},{"text":"That was the case which arose under Section 3 (4) of the Act.","start":595.769,"stop":600.865,"duration":5.1},{"text":"The appellees would not question as shown from the pleadings they have filed with this Court.","start":600.865,"stop":606.847,"duration":5.98},{"text":"Western Pacific standing here as the connecting line, if appellees already joined us in through rates on a level somewhat higher than they maintain with Southern Pacific.","start":606.847,"stop":621.941,"duration":15.09},{"text":"Yet they seriously contend that their flat refusal to join on any level constitutes the complete defense.","start":621.941,"stop":632.464,"duration":10.52},{"text":"That cannot be the law as Congress intended it nor as this Court has repeatedly interpreted it.","start":632.464,"stop":639.83,"duration":7.37},{"text":"Section 3 (4) is designed to assure the shipping public of the opportunity of choice between comparable, fully available service and the decision as to which to use is properly theirs, the shipping publics and not that of the carrier which is practicing the discrimination which is prohibited.","start":639.83,"stop":664.214,"duration":24.38},{"text":"As covered in our briefs, the position we take is fully supported by the legislative history, the case history, and the factual and the competitive situation here prevailing.","start":664.214,"stop":676.815,"duration":12.6},{"text":"Everyone on both sides of this case agrees that the two pivotal cases are Atlantic Coastlines and Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville.","start":676.815,"stop":687.221,"duration":10.41},{"text":"We agree with the United States that Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville clearly require an end to the discrimination.","start":687.221,"stop":695.473,"duration":8.25},{"text":"Atlantic Coastline, we say, supports our concept of connecting lines status.","start":695.473,"stop":701.881,"duration":6.41},{"text":"Just as in the instant case now before the Court, one of the complaining carriers there did not have physical connection with the line practicing the discrimination.","start":701.881,"stop":714.648,"duration":12.77},{"text":"At the first opportunity, the discriminating carrier took positive steps to make it clear that it was not holding out a through service with that carrier and this Court held that action to be unlawful.","start":714.648,"stop":732.407,"duration":17.76},{"text":"The Court required the Clinchfield, which in this -- in that case was in the position of the appellees here to be maintained as a neutral carrier treating its common connecting lines equally in the matter of rates.","start":732.407,"stop":747.349,"duration":14.94},{"text":"Such neutrality would not have been possible at all if the Clinchfield had been allowed the unilateral right to determine the extent of its rate participation with these connections.","start":747.349,"stop":760.682,"duration":13.33},{"text":"There was no requirement in that case of a pre-existing rate arrangement through the point of interchange.","start":760.682,"stop":769.091,"duration":8.41},{"text":"The Court was clearly in interested in the arrangements which existed to the point of common interchange.","start":769.091,"stop":776.292,"duration":7.2},{"text":"However, even had the Court than talking of an arrangement in the sense of one through the point of interchange, it was not in some technical through route sense that appellees used the term here, for the fact is that in Atlantic Coastline, there was no deliberate intentional, voluntary holding out of service by all participants.","start":776.292,"stop":804.078,"duration":27.79},{"text":"In fact, exactly the opposite was the case.","start":804.078,"stop":808.659,"duration":4.58},{"text":"The offending carriers there were taking every possible affirmative step available to them to prevent and disavow any such holding out.","start":808.659,"stop":820.087,"duration":11.43},{"text":"So therefore, properly construed, the key cases make it clear that Western Pacific position is sound and consistent with the present status of the law and that if we are determined to be a connecting line for the first time since the Bieber route was constructed, it will fulfill the purpose which the Commission and the public had in mind what it had the route constructed and that is to provide full competition.","start":820.087,"stop":855.077,"duration":34.99}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Treanor, I understand your point that the Commission gave far too narrow a
