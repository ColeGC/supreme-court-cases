precedent.”","start":740.773,"stop":747.915,"duration":7.14},{"text":"Now, the Arizona Supreme Court having built or having indicated its clear intention to imprison the Escobedo decision set about to do precisely that.","start":747.915,"stop":760.953,"duration":13.04},{"text":"First, as to the focusing question, it indicated that this crime had occurred at night.","start":760.953,"stop":767.221,"duration":6.27},{"text":"And consequently, despite the positive identification of the defendant by two witnesses, which the state urged were entirely fair lineups, the Supreme Court of Arizona indicated that even then perhaps under these facts, attention had not focused upon this defendant.","start":767.221,"stop":784.99,"duration":17.77},{"text":"I think this is sheer sophistry and would clearly indicate the obvious intent of the Arizona Supreme Court to confine Escobedo and to distinguish it whenever possible.","start":784.99,"stop":796.465,"duration":11.48},{"text":"Next, the court found that the defendant was advised of his rights in the reading of the typed portion immediately preceding its transcript.","start":796.465,"stop":803.781,"duration":7.32},{"text":"They permitted that document to lift itself by its own bootstraps so to speak, and to indicate that here was a man who was knowledgeable concerning his legal rights, despite the facts and circumstances of his background and his education.","start":803.781,"stop":817.191,"duration":13.41},{"text":"And they further found that he was knowledgeable because he had a prior criminal record, though in the decision he indicated this would be knowledge of his rights in court and certainly not his rights at the time of the interrogation.","start":817.191,"stop":833.211,"duration":16.02},{"text":"I think the numerous briefs filed in this case indicating the substantial split in the decisions throughout the various states, the Circuits and the Federal District Courts, indicate the interpretation that has been placed upon Escobedo.","start":833.211,"stop":850.455,"duration":17.24},{"text":"On the one hand, we

purposes.","start":491.405,"stop":509.748,"duration":18.34},{"text":"They showed that the booking was, in fact, at least as much for the FBI as for the local matters or the California felony warrant.","start":509.748,"stop":523.438,"duration":13.69},{"text":"As the arrest report which is prosecution's Exhibit 12 for identification shows, Westover was not booked on any specific charge.","start":523.438,"stop":536.467,"duration":13.03},{"text":"As in Haynes versus Washington, it was a “small book” with a -- hold for investigation.","start":536.467,"stop":548.143,"duration":11.68},{"text":"It then reads -- well, specifically it said investigation check-robbery.","start":548.143,"stop":554.407,"duration":6.26},{"text":"But then, what goes on to list -- the two matters which were to be checked, then recites as follows: \"Prior to the booking --

in California.","start":600.89,"stop":622.788,"duration":21.9},{"text":"This may not be conscious.","start":622.788,"stop":623.965,"duration":1.18},{"text":"I think it's certainly reads that way.","start":623.965,"stop":627.256,"duration":3.29},{"text":"The facts however show quite the contrary that there was an independent federal request for detention for its own questioning.","start":627.256,"stop":638.366,"duration":11.11},{"text":"The supplemental papers also showed that at least at the time of the booking, the federal authorities one, had a pretty fair ideas that petitioner was connected with the two Sacramento federal robberies enough to want to question him, and two, that they had by their request actively contributed if not to the arrest, to the booking and to Westover's subsequent detention for investigation.","start":638.366,"stop":673.358,"duration":34.99},{"text":"The other matters of federal involvement are well-enough documented in my brief to warrant the passing reference here.","start":673.358,"stop":679.834,"duration":6.48},{"text":"The joint federal state examination of the recovered currency, the joint federal state seizure of the top coat, the joint -- well, excuse me, the use of the state seized gun in procuring the federal confessions, and finally the transmittal of the state photographs or mugshots to Sacramento, California for use in the case.","start":679.834,"stop":704.992,"duration":25.16},{"text":"But the basis of these facts we submit that under both Escobedo and/or Anderson versus United States, the

quite apart, the period of lengthy detention.","start":737.723,"stop":766.678,"duration":28.96},{"text":"As four of the five cases right now before this Court indicate protracted detention for interrogation appears a routine for this behavior.","start":766.678,"stop":777.885,"duration":11.21},{"text":"It is precisely because of this detention that it seems to me the need for a safeguard

suspect from unwittingly or inadvisably relinquishing his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.","start":789.826,"stop":803.974,"duration":14.15},{"text":"The evil thought to be corrected by an Escobedo type philosophy is not the street corner confession, not the sole bearing spontaneous confession of guilt, not the “picture straight from confusion at arm” as the Government suggests on page 23 of its brief, nor indeed does it have to be and this perhaps is not here that has to be decided, it does not seemed to be the brief question and answer period during what the Government calls the completion of administrative formalities.","start":803.974,"stop":838.956,"duration":34.98},{"text":"What Escobedo does do, it seems to me, is to strike at precisely the very same evil which for federal law, the McNabb-Anderson exclusionary rule sought to strike out over 20 years ago, the secret detention for purposes of eliciting a confession.","start":838.956,"stop":862.08,"duration":23.12},{"text":"The second difficulty I find with the Solicitor General's approach is more serious, more crippling.","start":862.08,"stop":868.135,"duration":6.05},{"text":"The Department of Justice would have this Court turn back the clock as though Escobedo and its precursors such as Spano, White and Massiah did not exist.","start":868.135,"stop":879.303,"duration":11.17},{"text":"Thus the Government states as Mr. Earl has earlier alluded to, Escobedo was in fact nothing more than one more case of
