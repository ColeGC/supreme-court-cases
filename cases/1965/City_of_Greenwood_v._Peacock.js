Court.","start":18.297,"stop":22.307,"duration":4.01},{"text":"In this case, Peacock and 13 others filed a removal petition in the Federal District Court, alleging that they were being prosecuted in a police court of the City of Greenwood for blocking public streets.","start":22.307,"stop":39.324,"duration":17.02},{"text":"The District Court remanded the cases to the police court on the face of the petition.","start":39.324,"stop":46.405,"duration":7.08},{"text":"They appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which held that the allegations of the petition were sufficient, if proved, to make other case for removal under the first section of 28 U.S.C. 1443 and they reversed the case and remanded it to the District Court for the District Court to hear evidence to see if Peacock and those could prove the allegations of their petition.","start":46.405,"stop":79.1,"duration":32.69},{"text":"The Peacock petition alleges very little about the substance of the allegations are -- that Peacock -- the petitions are identical so only one is in the record.","start":79.1,"stop":95.086,"duration":15.99},{"text":"The allegations are that Peacock is a member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee which is associated with COFO and that they were engaged in civil rights work in assisting Negroes to register to vote.","start":95.086,"stop":116.633,"duration":21.55},{"text":"They then alleged that they were arrested for blocking public streets.","start":116.633,"stop":123.763,"duration":7.13},{"text":"They draw the conclusion and make the conclusionary allegation that because, well first, that the statute is being applied to them in support of a policy of segregation of the State of Mississippi and City of Greenwood.","start":123.763,"stop":143.481,"duration":19.72},{"text":"They then make the conclusionary allegation that because of their prosecution, because of the above that they are denied and cannot enforce in Court the equal rights of citizens under the Constitution in 42 U.S.C. 1971.","start":143.481,"stop":163.666,"duration":20.19},{"text":"Now the other cases were combined here.","start":163.666,"stop":166.553,"duration":2.89},{"text":"Those came along later, there were 15 defendants.","start":166.553,"stop":170.867,"duration":4.31},{"text":"They alleged prosecution in the police court of Greenwood for various offenses on different dates, assault and battery, driving a car with an improper license, reckless driving, matters of that kind.","start":170.867,"stop":187.423,"duration":16.56},{"text":"The District Court did the same thing with those cases, remanded them on the face of the petition.","start":187.423,"stop":193.071,"duration":5.65},{"text":"They came up in the Circuit Court of Appeals later in the Peacock case so that there was no briefing and no argument in that case.","start":193.071,"stop":199.552,"duration":6.48},{"text":"They sustained a summary motion to reverse on the ground that it was controlled by Peacock.","start":199.552,"stop":206.353,"duration":6.8},{"text":"Now what we were concerned with here in the Peacock case is the removal statute, 1443.","start":206.353,"stop":216.719,"duration":10.37},{"text":"Now it's settled law that this Court only has such jurisdiction in the removal case as Congress has conferred upon it, as conferred upon the federal courts and the question here is what jurisdiction Congress can put by the first section of 1443.","start":216.719,"stop":236.741,"duration":20.02},{"text":"Now that Section gives a person a right to remove in a civil or criminal prosecution, brought against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the Courts of such state, a right on any law providing for the equal rights of citizens of United States.","start":236.741,"stop":257.921,"duration":21.18},{"text":"Now the point that I want to emphasize in that is what I think the Court of Appeals overlooked is the language in that statute “who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such statement.”","start":257.921,"stop":272.778,"duration":14.86},{"text":"Now the statute provides that in order to remove, you have to file your removal petition before the trial.","start":272.778,"stop":283.243,"duration":10.46},{"text":"So -- that this Court has held that being true and that's the statute, you have to allege facts in advance of a trial to show that in the state court, you will be denied or cannot enforce some equal civil right.","start":283.243,"stop":304.367,"duration":21.12},{"text":"This Court therefore held in eight cases mentioned in the previous argument beginning with Strauder versus West Virginia and Virginia versus Rives on the same date and going down through Kentucky versus Powers that since that is true that you have to file your petition and allege and show in advance that you're going to be denied or cannot enforce an equal civil right in court.","start":304.367,"stop":333.79,"duration":29.42},{"text":"That therefore, it was not the intention of Congress by that statute to take care of any deprivation of rights that might come up on the trial for the first time because you wouldn't know that until it happened.","start":333.79,"stop":345.938,"duration":12.15},{"text":"That you had to be able to point it in advance that you would be denied or can enforce in the courts of a state an equal civil right and that the only way you could do that is where there was a statute or constitutional provision of the State which if the state court followed would obligate it to deny use on the equal civil right.","start":345.938,"stop":369.351,"duration":23.41},{"text":"Now in the absence of that, this Court has held in those eight cases or in the last seven at least, that you can't remove underneath that statute.","start":369.351,"stop":383.038,"duration":13.69},{"text":"They specifically held that if a subordinate officer undertakes to deprive a defendant of his equal civil rights in advance of trial by a person who is stacking the grand jury, refusing to put anybody on the grand jury if it's colored defendant except White people, that doesn't show that he is going to be denied or can't enforce his equal civil rights in the state court because the presumption is that the Court will correct that.","start":383.038,"stop":414.759,"duration":31.72},{"text":"That if it's a matter of stacking the grand jury that the Court when the trial comes on will sustain a motion to quash the indictment.","start":414.759,"stop":423.488,"duration":8.73},{"text":"If it's a matter of petit jury, the same thing.","start":423.488,"stop":425.792,"duration":2.3},{"text":"So that this Court held and it seems to me they were obligated to do it under the statute, but in any event, they held it eight times that you couldn't remove underneath the statute without showing in advance that you're going to be denied or couldn't enforce your rights in state court and that the only way you could show that is if there was a constitutional provision or statute of the state which if followed by the state court would have that result.","start":425.792,"stop":453.225,"duration":27.43},{"text":"Now that -- those decisions have been criticized by those who want more removal on the ground that is a restrictive interpretation of the statute.","start":453.225,"stop":462.642,"duration":9.42},{"text":"Well it doesn't seem that way to me.","start":462.642,"stop":464.971,"duration":2.33},{"text":"It seems to me that this Court went pretty far when it held that they weren't go and presume that the state court would do what it should do and disregard an invalid state statute and follow the paramount federal law.","start":464.971,"stop":482.34,"duration":17.37},{"text":"But that they would indulge in the presumption that the state court being bound by state law if there was a state statute or constitutional provision that they would say the state court was going to follow it and give the defendant the benefit of that presumption and permit him to remove.","start":482.34,"stop":499.765,"duration":17.43},{"text":"Now the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case, we submit with difference, completely overlooked that portion of the statute in the Peacock case.","start":499.765,"stop":510.021,"duration":10.26},{"text":"That is the portion that the denial or inability enforced has got to be in court and they completely, in our opinion, disregarded the eight decisions of this Court to that effect.","start":510.021,"stop":523.26,"duration":13.24},{"text":"What they held in the Peacock case was that the very institution of the prosecution would enable you to remove on allegation that the prosecution was instituted for an improper motive to deprive use of civil rights.","start":523.26,"stop":540.874,"duration":17.61},{"text":"In other words, what the Circuit Court of Appeals held was this that in this case where the arrest and charges were made by a policemen and I believe the alleged policemen and officers of the county, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that that was sufficient if an allegation that they were made by them for an improper motive to arrest them and exercise of their civil rights.","start":540.874,"stop":565.935,"duration":25.06},{"text":"Now the statute doesn't allege -- I mean the removal petition doesn't contain such an allegation but the Circuit Court of Appeals applied this notice type pleading doctrine and said they would infer that that's what the Peacock and all of those would contend.","start":565.935,"stop":580.57,"duration":14.64},{"text":"So they held that the mere institution of the prosecution by a policemen was sufficient to remove.","start":580.57,"stop":587.305,"duration":6.73},{"text":"Now just as a matter of common sense and logic, we submit that the institution of a prosecution or the making of a charge or an improper charge, if you please, by a policemen, does not show that you're deprived or cannot enforce your rights in state court.","start":587.305,"stop":608.116,"duration":20.81},{"text":"As held by this Court, the presumption is if there's something improper in there, if he's brought a charge that he should not have brought, the presumption is that the state court will sustain you and as such there's no way to say that the charge by a policemen means, it's a proof that you're denied or can't enforce your rights in a state court.","start":608.116,"stop":627.865,"duration":19.75},{"text":"Now if you replace the thing.","start":627.865,"stop":628.909,"duration":1.04},{"text":"Suppose that some federal marshal may enforce arrest or arrest a man with safe and improper motive, that certainly no proof that you are denied or can enforce your equal civil rights in the federal court and the same thing is true in this case, in the case of a policeman, but in any event, whether it's true or not, this Court has so held.","start":628.909,"stop":652.952,"duration":24.04},{"text":"Now this Court so held in seven cases that where a subordinate state officer packed the grand jury by illegally excluding colored persons from the grand jury and also the petit jury that the case was not removed.","start":652.952,"stop":671.837,"duration":18.88},{"text":"Now in that case, a charge was brought by a grand jury that it was improperly selected in violation of federal law and packed and they brought the charge.","start":671.837,"stop":684.217,"duration":12.38},{"text":"This Court held in those seven cases that that case was not removal because that did not show that you were denied or couldn't enforce your rights in state court that the presumption was a state court would enforce your rights and would quash the indictment as a whole.","start":684.217,"stop":700.457,"duration":16.24},{"text":"Now the Circuit Court of Appeals in Peacock is no doubt about their holding.","start":700.457,"stop":707.131,"duration":6.67},{"text":"If you'll read their opinion carefully, it's hard to believe that they even realized that this denial and enforcement had to be in the state court.","start":707.131,"stop":718.012,"duration":10.88},{"text":"In any event, they came out with just a flat holding that a prosecution for an improper motive instituted to deprive you of your civil rights made out a case of removal.","start":718.012,"stop":728.409,"duration":10.4}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, it is possible is it not to read Section 1 of 1443 to say something pretty much right along those lines and that is to read it the way Judge Sobeloff in the Fourth Circuit suggested and that it might be

of his equal civil rights by stacking the grand jury on and it didn't relate to a court, those cases, all seven of them would have been removed, but this Court held that that language and you can read it that way, applies to the Court.","start":763.605,"stop":785.273,"duration":21.67},{"text":"Now let me say this.","start":785.273,"stop":788.949,"duration":3.68},{"text":"I don't think that this Court should sustain the Court of Appeals in the Peacock case for these reasons.","start":788.949,"stop":799.952,"duration":11},{"text":"In the first place, if you do, you would have to overrule seven decisions.","start":799.952,"stop":806.093,"duration":6.14},{"text":"You have to overrule that part of the decision holding that under subsection (1) the denial or inability to enforce had to be shown by a state statute or constitutional provision.","start":806.093,"stop":819.413,"duration":13.32},{"text":"You would have to overrule that.","start":819.413,"stop":821.34,"duration":1.93},{"text":"You would have to overrule your own opinions in those seven cases that the acts of state officers in depriving you of your rights in advance of trial were not sufficient for removal because the presumption is the state court will correct it.","start":821.34,"stop":839.26,"duration":17.92},{"text":"Now those decisions of this Court have been in effect and have been a settled law since at least 1879.","start":839.26,"stop":848.69,"duration":9.43},{"text":"During that period of time, Congress has not made any significant changes in the wording of that statute that would affect those decisions and Congress having conferred the removal of jurisdiction and having acquiesced in that interpretation since at least 1879.","start":848.69,"stop":872.066,"duration":23.38},{"text":"I submit that it will be too late now to come in for this statute -- I mean for this Court to do what Congress has failed to do and that is to amend the statute and that's what he's arguing you should do.","start":872.066,"stop":884.265,"duration":12.2},{"text":"Now, in addition to that, I want to direct the Court's attention to this that in considering the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress had previously reenacted this statute a number of times without changing the word.","start":884.265,"stop":898.963,"duration":14.7},{"text":"In 1964, they have their specific attention directed to it in 1964.","start":898.963,"stop":903.888,"duration":4.93},{"text":"They amended the companion statute that enabled you to appeal from a remand order under 1443.","start":903.888,"stop":914.234,"duration":10.35},{"text":"Prior to that, you couldn't appeal so Congress had its particular attention directed to it and made the amendment permitting an appeal
