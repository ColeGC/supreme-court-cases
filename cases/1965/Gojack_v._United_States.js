appointed.","start":155.916,"stop":164.23,"duration":8.31},{"text":"Fourth, a resolution of January 20th, 1955 about a month before this hearing took place, granting the Chairman authority who

subject committed to the Subcommittee.","start":164.23,"stop":197.845,"duration":33.62},{"text":"It appears, and I don't think there's any dispute about this, that the subject under inquiry as

should also point out that there is no allegation in the indictment that the Subcommittee itself decided to undertake this investigation.","start":212.415,"stop":224.33,"duration":11.92},{"text":"In the Lamont case, Chief Justice Clark -- Chief Judge Clark held that the indictment under Section 192 involving a subcommittee must allege the authority of a Subcommittee to conduct an investigation into the subject claimed to be under inquiry.","start":224.33,"stop":244.062,"duration":19.73},{"text":"And that conversely, a reliance on the authority to the parent Committee was insufficient to

different were this a case of a Committee created by Congress to hold hearings for a specific purpose, with the inquiry in question apparently falling within the assigned purpose” and there is a CF citation to the Josephson case and the Josephson case of course did involve a House Committee hearing.","start":258.159,"stop":283.831,"duration":25.67},{"text":"The Lamont case involved a permanent -- the permanent investigation Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Government Operations.","start":283.831,"stop":294.504,"duration":10.67},{"text":"It was followed in the Second Circuit by the Seeger case, which was decided three days before this Court decided Russell and it ruled that a much more explicit indictment than is present here was defective because it had failed properly to allege the authority of the Subcommittee to conduct the hearings in issue.","start":294.504,"stop":319.844,"duration":25.34},{"text":"The court upheld this contention despite the fact that the indictment recited the fact, and I quote, “The full Committee had directed that an investigation be conducted of Communist infiltration in the fields of labor.”","start":319.844,"stop":334.401,"duration":14.56},{"text":"The Seeger Court's decision rests both on the grounds of competence and pertinence, that is, it construed the pertinency provisions of Section 192 to require that the question under inquiry as authorized be pleaded.","start":334.401,"stop":352.143,"duration":17.74},{"text":"Judge Moore concurred in the result because he felt, I believe, that the Josephson case was controlling, but he said despite the fact that the government proved that a clerk had directed that the -- an investigation be conducted of Communist infiltration, there was no proof of a resolution by the Committee.","start":352.143,"stop":378.633,"duration":26.49},{"text":"The majority on the court distinguished Josephson on the ground that the issue had not been raised there and that the challenge to the adequacy of the indictment was based on other grounds.","start":378.633,"stop":393.121,"duration":14.49},{"text":"The court also distinguished the Sacher case which is relied on here by the Government, that is the Seeger Court, first on the ground that the court in Sacher, which was decided by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, had ignored the rationale of the Lamont case, and second on the ground that the court there was primarily concerned with the impact on Sacher of the remand in the Watkins case and really did not directly come to grips with this issue.","start":393.121,"stop":430.348,"duration":37.23},{"text":"In my brief at pages 44 to 45, I distinguish the Sacher case on two additional grounds, but I don't want to go into it here.","start":430.348,"stop":438.772,"duration":8.42},{"text":"I want to get on with my further argument about assuming this Seeger-Lamont view is correct, the question then arises whether a Committee is required when an investigation is conducted, narrower in scope than the full range of the Committee's power to designate for itself through a resolution or a motion the subject under inquiry.","start":438.772,"stop":470.561,"duration":31.79},{"text":"Or whether conversely a Subcommittee can on its own decide (a) that an investigation is to be conducted, (b) construe the Rule 11 that is the authorizing resolution as to what it means, (c) decides that a legislative purpose would be served, (d) decide that the facts already existing were inadequate.","start":470.561,"stop":497.474,"duration":26.91},{"text":"Now that really is the nub of the case in my view, because it seems to me that it would be unthinkable to hold that a Subcommittee of the House on Un-American Activities Committee could on its own under a blanket investigation decide all of these questions and I think a useful place to start would be the Legislative Reorganization Act and system of controls which had been erected on it, which are in many ways very admirable.","start":497.474,"stop":536.096,"duration":38.62},{"text":"Since the Legislative Reorganization Act was passed, legislative investigations with the a subpoena power, and that is the great war shed as it were in this field it seems to me, what happens when the subpoena power is invoked?","start":536.096,"stop":552.167,"duration":16.07},{"text":"Legislative investigations with a subpoena power are either directly authorized by Congress with a limited and clearly defined subject matter and duration, the so-called special investigations or indirectly through a standing committee but similarly limited as to subject and duration.","start":552.167,"stop":575.949,"duration":23.78},{"text":"The jurisdiction of standing committees is too broad and general, agriculture, armed services, judiciary, to support the use of subpoena power without further refinement and delegation.","start":575.949,"stop":591.349,"duration":15.4},{"text":"Thus every investigation is ultimately a special investigation in the sense that whatever the immediate source of its authority, Congress or a parent standing committee, it has a clearly defined subject matter and a duration authoritatively fixed by the parent body in each case.","start":591.349,"stop":614.353,"duration":23},{"text":"Now the House Committee is in many ways a sport.","start":614.353,"stop":618.488,"duration":4.14},{"text":"It began as a special Committee, but there can no doubt that it shares in most important particulars, this characteristic of a standing committee.","start":618.488,"stop":631.112,"duration":12.62},{"text":"And moreover, it is not only a standing committee with an area jurisdiction in the standing committee sense rather than a limited subject jurisdiction, but its charter is too vague to support the use of a subpoena power in any event.","start":631.112,"stop":649.734,"duration":18.62},{"text":"In other words, it's not only general like Agriculture, but it's vague like Un-American.","start":649.734,"stop":656.513,"duration":6.78},{"text":"Thus, the Committee does not and could not use compulsory process to probe, and I'm quoting the rule, “The extent, character and objects of Un-American propaganda activities in the United States or the diffusion with the United States of subversive and Un-American propaganda.”","start":656.513,"stop":679.982,"duration":23.47},{"text":"And as a matter of fact as I point out on my brief, the Committee has completely redefined its resolution to eliminate the word propaganda from it altogether.","start":679.982,"stop":689.678,"duration":9.7},{"text":"The Committee construes its charter then none of them ad hoc assignment, you can't find one investigation in the 20 years that the Committee has been in existence as the standing committee into the literal terms of its rule.","start":689.678,"stop":704.917,"duration":15.24},{"text":"It construes its charter not as an ad hoc assignment, but as a grant of jurisdiction over a broad area.","start":704.917,"stop":713.948,"duration":9.03},{"text":"Indeed an area almost without boundaries, segments of which are interpreted by the Committee and then probed piecemeal.","start":713.948,"stop":723.983,"duration":10.03},{"text":"On the face of it, turning to our case, Communist activities in the field of labor, Communist Party activities, is a subject not even mentioned in Rule 11 and obviously required an initial construction and delegation before the Committee's agent, the Subcommittee, could proceed.","start":723.983,"stop":747.379,"duration":23.4},{"text":"Now the characteristic modus operandi of the Committee is to choose by resolution or motion a particular subject and assign a committee to investigate.","start":747.379,"stop":760.452,"duration":13.07},{"text":"In my brief at page 37, I have assembled some samples of hearings where these resolutions are recited and I would like with the indulgence of the Court just to read one of them, the type of resolution which typically triggers a committee investigation.","start":760.452,"stop":779.806,"duration":19.35},{"text":"“Be it resolved,” this is a Committee resolution in connection with the hearings in Newark, New Jersey in 1958, “Be it resolved that a hearing by the Committee or a Subcommittee thereof to be held in Newark, New Jersey or such other place or places that the Chairman may designate on such date or dates that the Chairman may determine, be authorized and approved including the conduct of investigation deemed reasonably necessary by the staff in preparation therefore, relating to the following subjects and having the legislative purposes indicated.”","start":779.806,"stop":814.936,"duration":35.13},{"text":"Now, these resolutions accomplish at least three things in the Committee's internal housekeeping.","start":814.936,"stop":822.881,"duration":7.94},{"text":"First they assign a Subcommittee a subject matter, second they register the approval of the Committee for the investigation, and I will have occasion in my next point to discuss the violation of Rule 1 of the Committee which requires approval of the Committee of every major investigation and third, these resolutions designate the legislative purposes which the hearing is to be conducted.","start":822.881,"stop":851.852,"duration":28.97},{"text":"Now I suggest that this practice is not optional for it's required by law and I suggest this because first only the Committee can authorize an investigation.","start":851.852,"stop":869.537,"duration":17.69},{"text":"It seems to me that this is almost obvious.","start":869.537,"stop":874.857,"duration":5.32},{"text":"Second, only the Committee can construe its own rule.","start":874.857,"stop":880.974,"duration":6.12},{"text":"Certainly an agent of the Committee, a Subcommittee which is not even an agent of Congress, but an agent of the Committee is never elected by Congress, hence construe the meaning of Rule 11, that's a job for the Committee at the first instance.","start":880.974,"stop":898.546,"duration":17.57},{"text":"Third, the Committee must determine whether a legislative purpose would be served by holding a particular hearing.","start":898.546,"stop":907.972,"duration":9.43},{"text":"It seems to me true that this is self-evident and I think that because the Committee didn't do that in this case, we have a situation in which a statute covering the precise area which was supposedly under investigation here Communist Party activities in the field of labor.","start":907.972,"stop":929.728,"duration":21.76},{"text":"Exact statute was passed some six months before this hearing took place, that's the Communist Infiltration Act of 1954.","start":929.728,"stop":939.155,"duration":9.43},{"text":"Now the Committee -- if the Committee were really making a deliberate judgment on the need -- the legislative need, the legislative purpose for this investigation, if it was singling out some evil in a deliberate considered way which required legislative therapy, one very much doubts whether it would've chosen this already legislatively exhausted subject.","start":939.155,"stop":966.887,"duration":27.73},{"text":"Finally, the Committee must decide whether the facts are needed.","start":966.887,"stop":971.314,"duration":4.43},{"text":"Now, there is one other consideration which seems to me to point to the necessity of a committee determination and that is the court's ruling in the Watkins case.","start":971.314,"stop":985.471,"duration":14.16},{"text":"It seems to me that the Watkins ruling can almost be distilled to say that where First Amendment freedoms are involved in a probe, these four responsibilities that I've just been talking about for authorization, construction, legislative purpose and fact gathering and I could -- there quotations in the decision which justify what I'm about to say for each of these areas.","start":985.471,"stop":1015.412,"duration":29.94},{"text":"That these four areas, when the First Amendment is involved, create responsibilities which much -- must be lodged as close as possible to the source of power.","start":1015.412,"stop":1030.208,"duration":14.8},{"text":"It seems to me that the Watkins decision says that we must present, and I'm quoting now, “the separation of power and responsibility” in First Amendment cases particularly and it seems to me also that that almost requires the kind of result that I'm arguing for here.","start":1030.208,"stop":1050.629,"duration":20.42},{"text":"Now, Your Honors will recall that I stated at the outset that this argument has two parts.","start":1050.629,"stop":1056.168,"duration":5.54},{"text":"I've dealt -- I'm dealing up till now with the question of competence.","start":1056.168,"stop":1060.403,"duration":4.24},{"text":"I want to deal now with the question of pertinence.","start":1060.403,"stop":1064.061,"duration":3.66},{"text":"Preliminary, let me say that I think that outside of the area of pertinence, considered truly as a First Amendment question, the Committee should be required to decide that the need for the facts is so exigent as to warrant an invasion of First Amendment rights and the only way that can be expressed is through a detailed delegation to the Subcommittee specifying by an agent of Congress to subordinating and compelling demands which require investigative action.","start":1064.061,"stop":1106.101,"duration":42.04},{"text":"Now, I want to turn to the Russell case and the construction of the Russell case.","start":1106.101,"stop":1111.132,"duration":5.03},{"text":"This Court held in Russell that the question under inquiry for purposes of Section 192 pertinency requirement must be pleaded.","start":1111.132,"stop":1122.429,"duration":11.3},{"text":"This, it seems to me, requires a statement of the matter not as considered merely by the Subcommittee Chairman as confided by the Subcommittee to -- as confided for the Subcommittee by the full Committee, but rather a statement, an original statement of delegation by the Committee Chairman.","start":1122.429,"stop":1142.62,"duration":20.19},{"text":"Statutory pertinency as opposed to due process pertinency turns on the relationship of the unanswered questions to the authorized question.","start":1142.62,"stop":1153.948,"duration":11.33},{"text":"It is significant I think that in all of the Court of Appeals decisions cited in the Russell case where the inquiry was recited in the indictment, there were decisions in the Second, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits, the question that was contained in the resolution was the one -- the question that was deemed to be under inquiry for purposes of the pertinency provisions of the contempt statute, were the ones delegated by the full Committee.","start":1153.948,"stop":1190.664,"duration":36.72},{"text":"That was true in the Yellin case and the Davis case and in the Second Circuit cases.","start":1190.664,"stop":1195.69,"duration":5.03},{"text":"That is, in every instance where a grand jury returns an indictment, reciting the matter under inquiry, they recited the matter as stated by the full Committee in a delegation to the Subcommittee.","start":1195.69,"stop":1209.591,"duration":13.9},{"text":"I also think it's of some interest that since the Russell case and under the compulsion of the Russell case there have been at least five indictments in the District of Columbia.","start":1209.591,"stop":1221.37,"duration":11.78},{"text":"Two of them incidentally by the same grand jury that indicted petitioner and that all without exception recites the delegation of the full Committee to the Subcommittee.","start":1221.37,"stop":1234.344,"duration":12.97},{"text":"Now it's interesting to trace the background of this pertinency requirement.","start":1234.344,"stop":1239.558,"duration":5.21},{"text":"Originally, when the statute was passed the congressional practice was to launch every investigation with a special resolution.","start":1239.558,"stop":1257.123,"duration":17.57},{"text":"In other words, there were -- this problem never arose because Congress itself was explicit in delegating the matter under inquiry through a special resolution and the court in the Barry case simply construes the statute, the 1857 statute, to read just that way.","start":1257.123,"stop":1280.234,"duration":23.11},{"text":"They say that the pertinency requirement is a requirement of pertinency to the matter delegated by the full Committee.","start":1280.234,"stop":1289.438,"duration":9.2},{"text":"There was one occasion in the House of Representatives when this statute was construed that was in 1955.","start":1289.438,"stop":1297.804,"duration":8.37},{"text":"When the Chairman of the Rules Committee, Howard Smith, answered a question in connection with the debate that was introduced -- that was conducted in the House with respect to a resolution introduced by Congressman Doyle amending a House Rule to require that the announcement at the beginning of the hearing of the subject -- under -- to require some announcement at the beginning of the hearing of the subject under inquiry.","start":1297.804,"stop":1328.951,"duration":31.15},{"text":"And Congressman Smith was asked whether this announcement, which is a kind of announcement we have in this case, was the kind of announcement which would serve as the foundation for pertinency for purposes of the contempt statute and he said, “No, it was not.”","start":1328.951,"stop":1349.128,"duration":20.18},{"text":"That the statement of the Chairman of the Committee at the hearing which would be made pursuant to this rule was not the statement which was required -- not the statement of pertinency which was required under the contempt statute.","start":1349.128,"stop":1368.576,"duration":19.45},{"text":"It seems to me that in effect, the House is required -- the House Committee is required in order to comply with the pertinency provisions of the contempt statute to make a special resolution in every case in which an investigation is launched.","start":1368.576,"stop":1390.673,"duration":22.1},{"text":"In order to furnish the foundation for the -- for a resolution of the issue of pertinency, there must be an authentic detailing of the question under inquiry.","start":1390.673,"stop":1404.98,"duration":14.31},{"text":"It seems to me that that it is this authorization, this special delegation which is the charter of the Subcommittee in the sense of Rumely case it must be created by the Committee and recited in the indictment not only for the reasons of competence, pertinency, and free speech already referred to, but to enable a court and defendant to determine whether the Committee exceeds its jurisdiction and whether the Subcommittee acted within its terms of reference.","start":1404.98,"stop":1436.978,"duration":32},{"text":"Now, the Government's answer to all this is that the indictment is insufficient because -- it is sufficient, forgive me, because it recited that the Committee assigned all of its powers to the Subcommittee.","start":1436.978,"stop":1452.458,"duration":15.48},{"text":"But the subject under inquiry was not all of the Committee's power which is I think is quite clear could never be a subject under inquiry, but the relatively narrow subject of Communist activities in the field of labor, Communist Party activities, a subject which I have pointed out already can't even be extrapolated so to speak, can't be inferred from the resolution by reading it.","start":1452.458,"stop":1477.746,"duration":25.29},{"text":"You have to bring to it some special kind of a focus in order to -- you have to -- in other words this is an area where in order to specify this matter under inquiry, some construction must be made and the Committee had to do it.","start":1477.746,"stop":1495.339,"duration":17.59},{"text":"Now, I want to turn next to the fact that there was no proof of delegation.","start":1495.339,"stop":1500.599,"duration":5.26},{"text":"There is no proof at all in this record this the Subcommittee was authorized to conduct the matter alleged to be under inquiry and in order to conserve my time, I'll refer you to the brief on that point and deal with my third point which is the question of the rule.","start":1500.599,"stop":1520.866,"duration":20.27},{"text":"I think the Yellin case holds that violations by the Committee of its own rules precludes a conviction for contempt.","start":1520.866,"stop":1527.988,"duration":7.12},{"text":"Rule 1 of the Committee requires that no major investigation shall be initiated without approval of a majority of the Committee.","start":1527.988,"stop":1536.923,"duration":8.93},{"text":"Rule 11 of the House Rules require that standing committee shall keep a record of all committee actions.","start":1536.923,"stop":1543.563,"duration":6.64},{"text":"Now the entire file of the Committee was introduced in evidence in this case and there is no evidence at all that this rule was complied despite the fact that it's clearly a major investigation and the Government doesn't dispute that.","start":1543.563,"stop":1559.793,"duration":16.23},{"text":"Now, the rule -- it's a simple rule designed to prevent one-man rule to be redundant and to prevent partisanship in administration of the investigatory process and most committees have such rules.","start":1559.793,"stop":1573.332,"duration":13.54},{"text":"It is a modest attempt, again to refer to Watkins, to prevent the separation of power from responsibility, that measure of added care which you spoke of Mr. Chief Justice in that case, which Committee should be required to engage in to ensure fairness.","start":1573.332,"stop":1591.277,"duration":17.94},{"text":"Now Government claims that this rule was complied with because sometime in 1949 or 1952, either one I don't know which, the Committee had commenced to pursuit of the union on which petitioner was a member and this was a continuing investigation.","start":1591.277,"stop":1613.351,"duration":22.07},{"text":"Now Your Honors, I'm appalled with this contention, because in American investigative practice, we don't have – we don't have continuing investigations.","start":1613.351,"stop":1624.281,"duration":10.93},{"text":"That aside, it's confessing that we have a kind of star chamber in this country that a Committee can use a subpoena power to investigate individuals and organizations indefinitely without resort to the conventional controls of Congress.","start":1624.281,"stop":1640.034,"duration":15.75},{"text":"And it seems to me that it points out very sharply the fact that this whole investigation was governed and determined only by the available supply of exposable witnesses.","start":1640.034,"stop":1652.838,"duration":12.8},{"text":"As a matter of fact, the first entry of this Committee in this case was a decision to subpoena the petitioner.","start":1652.838,"stop":1661.3,"duration":8.46},{"text":"Not a statement of a legislative purpose or a decision to subpoena
