distinction.","start":631.087,"stop":635.489,"duration":4.4},{"text":"In Alexander against Hillman, the jurisdiction was exercised as to equitable counterclaims, but in the case today before the Court, the counterclaims are not equitable, they are legal.","start":635.489,"stop":650.989,"duration":15.5},{"text":"They are counterclaims for money had and

demanded.","start":657.024,"stop":666.539,"duration":9.51},{"text":"The next distinction as I mentioned is that Alexander against Hillman, as we understand the case, involved only and completely the

here.","start":688.213,"stop":698.269,"duration":10.06},{"text":"Here we have, as I have said, then counterclaims involving legal issues as to which a jury trial could be

opinion written by Mr. Justice Butler in 1932.","start":711.746,"stop":729.458,"duration":17.71},{"text":"There, there was a plenary action filed to recover a preference.","start":729.458,"stop":735.409,"duration":5.95},{"text":"Here clearly, a plenary action could have been filed.","start":735.409,"stop":740.035,"duration":4.63},{"text":"There the case was

case.","start":781.529,"stop":785.931,"duration":4.4},{"text":"The only thing that can be done as we see it to get around that case is to say that Alexander against Hillman overruled it, but Alexander

said Guaranty Trust had received after the bankruptcy adjudication.","start":848.003,"stop":873.546,"duration":25.54},{"text":"This Court there pointed out that to put upon a creditor almost, well, this isn't the Court's language of course, but to put on upon a creditor almost the problem of Russian roulette, when you file a claim in a bankruptcy, the Court would be completely unfair that the argument which is made in some of the circuit court opinions that anybody who files a lawsuit is subjected to the hazard of a counterclaim that that argument does not apply.","start":873.546,"stop":907.598,"duration":34.05},{"text":"Sure, you're always subjected to the hazards of a counterclaim, but you're subjected to the hazards of a counterclaim in a court where all of the orderly processes of the court should apply.","start":907.598,"stop":921.354,"duration":13.76},{"text":"And to say that a creditor who by exercising is very, very lawful right of seeking to recover his portion of a debt out of a bankruptcy estate must then subject himself to the risk of a counterclaim based upon a preference without the protections of a full trial in a plenary action is to make the filing of a claim in a bankruptcy estate a matter of serious risk.","start":921.354,"stop":956.03,"duration":34.68}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
