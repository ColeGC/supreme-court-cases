business.","start":172.75,"stop":191.361,"duration":18.61},{"text":"The position of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue which has enjoyed at least 40 years of consistent judicial acceptance both in the trial courts and the Court of Appeals is that expenses incurred in defending against a criminal prosecution which results in the taxpayer's conviction are not deductible.","start":191.361,"stop":214.901,"duration":23.54},{"text":"This position is bottomed upon the public policy expressed in the statute which the taxpayer is convicted of violating.","start":214.901,"stop":226.79,"duration":11.89},{"text":"The Commissioner in the courts had, at various times, expressed this theory in a couple of different

essence, regardless of the way of phrasing it, the Commissioner believes that the theory of nondeductibility is premised upon the public policy ground.","start":254.784,"stop":269.015,"duration":14.23},{"text":"That is that Congress or the state legislature in prohibiting criminal acts could not have been intending that a taxpayer receive a

expenses.","start":346.813,"stop":356.414,"duration":9.6},{"text":"While it can be argued that the expenses of attempting to avoid a criminal conviction and possible imprisonment are personal in

of attorney's fees incurred in defending civil lawsuits, this Court has recognized that whether the expenses of resisting a lawsuit are to be regarded as personal or business in nature depends on the type of activities out of which the claim arose, rather than upon the consequences losing a suit would have on the taxpayer.","start":370.829,"stop":399.283,"duration":28.45},{"text":"For example, if the taxpayer engaged in the business of delivering packages is involved in an accident and defend the tort suit arising out of that accident, his expenses of resisting the damage claim would be deductible, because the origin of the suit would be his business activities.","start":399.283,"stop":419.3,"duration":20.02},{"text":"Whereas if the same taxpayer was on the way to a cocktail party
