industry.","start":335.93,"stop":382.164,"duration":46.23},{"text":"The Court said we have to consider all of that information in the certificate proceeding itself before we can say you can't offer it

intermediate period.","start":492.228,"stop":504.723,"duration":12.5},{"text":"The court agreed with us that this is a situation where refunds are called for but they adopted a different standard of

groups.","start":546.556,"stop":552.41,"duration":5.85},{"text":"The -- they were all made by the way and this is critical, all of these sales were originally made under contracts in 1957 and 1958 and

1956.","start":567.962,"stop":576.071,"duration":8.11},{"text":"Now the first of these sales were certificated by the Commission in September 1958 and they were certificated at prices that ranged from 22.4 to 23.3 or 8 cents per Mcf.","start":576.071,"stop":594.202,"duration":18.13},{"text":"This was a price which was a cent and a half to a cent higher than the CATCO price which was then in the courts.","start":594.202,"stop":600.314,"duration":6.11},{"text":"And it was a price which the Commission decision admitted could trigger at least half a million dollars of increases in the pipelines rates.","start":600.314,"stop":612.346,"duration":12.03},{"text":"This decision was affirmed by the Third Circuit.","start":612.346,"stop":617.073,"duration":4.73},{"text":"It was appealed to this Court and this Court without even having oral argument summarily reversed and sent it back to the Commission to consider in the light of the CATCO decision and that is an opinion appearing at 361 U.S., Public Service Commission of New York versus the FPC.","start":617.073,"stop":636.335,"duration":19.26},{"text":"Now in the meantime these other applications were before the Commission and they were originally also granted without any price condition although their prices were also in this 21 to 23 cent range.","start":636.335,"stop":652.919,"duration":16.58},{"text":"But they were decided on August 10th, 1959, a week after the Third Circuit's opinion in the earlier case which is I said was subsequently reversed here.","start":652.919,"stop":666.712,"duration":13.79},{"text":"And since these decisions were post-CATCO cases the Commission did purport to follow the CATCO rule.","start":666.712,"stop":677.842,"duration":11.13},{"text":"But in each case in determining that these sales were in line what it did was say they were in line because they were no higher than the sales involved in CATCO or in the Public Service case and therefore were in line.","start":677.842,"stop":695.088,"duration":17.25},{"text":"These cases were in due course appealed to the courts and then a series of opinions by a number of Courts of Appeals, each and everyone of them was reversed on the ground that in attempting to determine the proper initial price line it was improper for the Commission to rely upon the CATCO and public service sales which were themselves in issue in the courts at that time.","start":695.088,"stop":727.041,"duration":31.95},{"text":"And the Court went on in both the Ninth Circuit case which I'll quote from and this was

court or commission review.","start":727.041,"stop":752.979,"duration":25.94},{"text":"Like prices from the same area though not currently under review ought to be regarded a suspect ought to be

invalidated certificates throughout the course of the court litigation.","start":766.757,"stop":777.784,"duration":11.03},{"text":"They've done so of course with full knowledge of litigation and they done so perfectly legally since they were authorized to operate by the Commission.","start":777.784,"stop":788.987,"duration":11.2},{"text":"When the cases were remanded to the Commission, the question came up as to how these should be handled during the interim acquired for further commission review.","start":788.987,"stop":798.748,"duration":9.76},{"text":"In the CATCO case itself and a number of other cases which have been remanded the Commission had actually set aside the original certificates and issued new temporary certificates with refund obligations.","start":798.748,"stop":814.805,"duration":16.06},{"text":"The Commission here said this was unnecessary that our normal powers were more than adequate to allow them to continue to operate on the old certificate but the Commission made clear that of course at the conclusion of the case they would be obligated to pay such refunds as it might turn out to be appropriate in the light of what the proper certificate price was.","start":814.805,"stop":844.971,"duration":30.17},{"text":"The hearing was held in 1962.","start":844.971,"stop":847.853,"duration":2.88},{"text":"The remanded hearing of these consolidated proceedings.","start":847.853,"stop":851.558,"duration":3.71},{"text":"By that time the Commission had had considerable experience in producer certificate cases under the standards established by CATCO as elaborated by the Civil Courts of Appeals and the Commission had decided as a matter of general policy that it would fix the initial price and I'll explain what that is in a few minutes, in order to fix the initial price at the in line level which as I indicated as the Courts of Appeals had indicated was the price at which substantial amounts of gas in the area were contemporaneously flowing under other contracts, contracts which were not involved in litigation or not affected by the sales which are involved in litigation.","start":851.558,"stop":900.759,"duration":49.2},{"text":"Now in a number of the earlier preceding that preceded this one, the Commission had permitted producers to submit evidence of their cost or industry cost of economic trend and without exception the Commission had filed as it evolved this in line price document.","start":900.759,"stop":924.376,"duration":23.62},{"text":"This evidence was of no value to them that it was not persuasive.","start":924.376,"stop":929.817,"duration":5.44},{"text":"And in and of itself it usually was no good and that anyway it was simply delaying the entire proceeding.","start":929.817,"stop":937.298,"duration":7.48},{"text":"But the Commission had expressly held that in the earlier Skelly case and it's determination on that point was subsequently affirmed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.","start":937.298,"stop":949.825,"duration":12.53},{"text":"In this case when similar evidence was introduced it was rejected by the examiner, Officer Proofer made but there was no cross-examinations, no rebuttal made on it, was rejected by the examiner and the Commission expressly affirmed this rejection.","start":949.825,"stop":971.957,"duration":22.13},{"text":"As to the in line price itself the Commission held that there was a considerable amount of gas that was flowing at the either 18 and a half cents or below in this area that all of the prices in 1957 and 1958 which were higher than that were as the testimony indicated, the direct result of the new plateau which had been set in CATCO and the Public Service case.","start":971.957,"stop":1004.932,"duration":32.98},{"text":"And that no showing had been made that any of these higher prices were not this result of CATCO and that therefore anything higher than 18 and a half cents or 20 cents, it -- there was a tax problem, would be out of line contrary to the public interest.","start":1004.932,"stop":1028.151,"duration":23.22},{"text":"The Commission affirmed us but the Commission did one more thing.","start":1028.151,"stop":1033.801,"duration":5.65},{"text":"The Commission held that not only was the proper in line starting point 18 and a half cents or 20 cents, let me explain that briefly.","start":1033.801,"stop":1043.761,"duration":9.96},{"text":"Some of this gas is sold from offshore areas where the state taxing authority does not apply.","start":1043.761,"stop":1051.874,"duration":8.11},{"text":"Some of it is sold within the taxing authority of the State of Louisiana and the difference between 18 and a half and 20 cents which you may sometimes hear during the course of this argument reflects that.","start":1051.874,"stop":1066.432,"duration":14.56},{"text":"The Commission said this is the proper starting place and you may file increases above that starting place to the extent that your

likely to endanger triggering the type this Court is familiar with as a result of favored nation clauses, from redetermination clauses and all this paraphernalia of contract provisions which has been outlawed as of 1962 but which exist in many, many contracts which have been certificated prior to that date.","start":1106.389,"stop":1145.68,"duration":39.29},{"text":"The essential issue presented
