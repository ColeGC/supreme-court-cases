defendant.","start":25.878,"stop":50.639,"duration":24.76},{"text":"On August 5, 1964, the appellee was indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.","start":50.639,"stop":59.746,"duration":9.11},{"text":"It was a six-count indictment charging violations of willful attempt to evade payment of the taxes and also to subscribing false corporate returns.","start":59.746,"stop":73.208,"duration":13.46},{"text":"A motion to dismiss was filed against indictment and the motion dismissed was grounded on three propositions that the defendant could not get a fair trial, second, the alleged he was denied right to counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, and third that he had been compelled to testify against himself in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.","start":73.208,"stop":109.47,"duration":36.26},{"text":"The facts are reasonably simple and not essentially in dispute.","start":109.47,"stop":116.018,"duration":6.55},{"text":"The counsel for the appellee attended conferences with the Internal Revenue Service officials in November of 1962 and again in March of 1963.","start":116.018,"stop":127.548,"duration":11.53},{"text":"And that both of these meetings, Internal Revenue made it clear to the counsel for appellee that they were going to recommend criminal prosecution with no question that was understood on both sides.","start":127.548,"stop":143.227,"duration":15.68},{"text":"And on April 9 of 1963, the jeopardy assessment against appellees known assets was issued pursuant to Section 6861 of the Code.","start":143.227,"stop":155.289,"duration":12.06},{"text":"And on June 6 of the same year, the statutory notice of deficiencies for each

Court.","start":166.794,"stop":172.599,"duration":5.8},{"text":"And these petitions appeared to be a normal type and they provide the appellee's name and address, et cetera, the office, “the

paragraphs.","start":172.599,"stop":201.446,"duration":28.85},{"text":"These were practically identical and the sample of one is set out on page 5 of our brief so that it would not be necessary to go into the record.","start":201.446,"stop":212.771,"duration":11.32},{"text":"And it was the appellee's position that the filing of these petitions amounted to testimony and incriminating evidence which

gave up some information.","start":249.553,"stop":257.976,"duration":8.42},{"text":"When we read the petitions there, the usual type of petitions, which says that the jeopardy assessment is wrong, solely it says -- it says it over and over again in their beautiful language, well that's all there is good.","start":257.976,"stop":272.912,"duration":14.94},{"text":"And that I think I should mention that throughout the colloquy with counsel.","start":272.912,"stop":278.971,"duration":6.06},{"text":"The judge consulaire says that he has incriminated himself in violation of the Fifth

trial.","start":286.575,"stop":293.566,"duration":6.99},{"text":"However, the U.S. Attorney repeatedly made it clear that these jeopardy assessments, the petitions and nothing else were going to be used at the trial.","start":293.566,"stop":307.859,"duration":14.29},{"text":"There was no question, if they weren't going to be used.","start":307.859,"stop":310.607,"duration":2.75},{"text":"There was -- it was true that they were into files, this criminal -- the U.S. Attorney's Office.","start":310.607,"stop":317.462,"duration":6.85},{"text":"And the position taken by the court below is that the -- this in and of itself was final.","start":317.462,"stop":329.508,"duration":12.05},{"text":"We then applied to the Court's -- appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and on that motion, the case was appealed and certified here.","start":329.508,"stop":340.878,"duration":11.37},{"text":"There are two points that we have involved and there are only two.","start":340.878,"stop":345.522,"duration":4.64},{"text":"One is the question as to whether or not this case is properly here on certification from the Court of Appeals in the form of a direct appeal.","start":345.522,"stop":356.553,"duration":11.03},{"text":"And I meet that one first because it's the Court's jurisdiction.","start":356.553,"stop":361.535,"duration":4.98},{"text":"And 18 U.S. Code 3731 provides for this direct appeal when an indictment is dismissed as a result of a motion in bar.","start":361.535,"stop":374.805,"duration":13.27},{"text":"Now, first of all, as to whether or not this is actually what the statute says, I would like to point out that there's no question on the finality of the judgment.","start":374.805,"stop":390.224,"duration":15.42},{"text":"The judge did not issue an order even though he invited an appeal.","start":390.224,"stop":397.214,"duration":6.99},{"text":"He started out inviting one and ended up inviting one, he didn't write an opinion.","start":397.214,"stop":403.131,"duration":5.92},{"text":"But the order itself says specifically that the indictment is dismissed.","start":403.131,"stop":410.568,"duration":7.44},{"text":"The bail is discharged and the defendant is released.","start":410.568,"stop":417.375,"duration":6.81},{"text":"And the District Judge said specifically from the bench, “When the Government said in motion the jeopardy assessment and the 90-day letter which compelled him to come forward within a certain time and filed his petition in the Tax Court, they, the Government, foreclosed themselves from proceeding in the criminal case during that time.”","start":417.375,"stop":446.81,"duration":29.44},{"text":"Now, while this phrase, “during that time” somebody might think meant temporarily.","start":446.81,"stop":453.615,"duration":6.81},{"text":"In fact, as the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit said in this case, “If the trial court's views are correct, there is no possible way in which the defect in the indictment can be cured in this case or in any other indictment that may be found.","start":453.615,"stop":474.529,"duration":20.91},{"text":"Secondly, there is no question that this ruling was made on the motion by the defendant based upon facts not covered by the criminal statute or the indictment.","start":474.529,"stop":486.838,"duration":12.31},{"text":"It was not in any person who brought him in.","start":486.838,"stop":490.252,"duration":3.41},{"text":"And the appellee's position in this regard was summarized in its assertion which was in its motion to dismiss that by virtue of the assertion of taxes, penalties and interest against the defendant, the filing of income tax, liens, and the seizure of his assets, defendant had been compelled to execute statements of fact pertaining to his income tax liabilities from the years 1958 to 1960 in pleadings required to be presented to the Tax Court of the United States and to the Internal Revenue Service, thereby, compelling this defendant to testify against himself in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the characters of the United States.”","start":490.252,"stop":539.216,"duration":48.96},{"text":"That seems to me clearly that this is within the general rule on the question of appellate jurisdiction of this Court.","start":539.216,"stop":551.323,"duration":12.11},{"text":"I would say further that it's clearly set forth in the Court of Appeals decision in this very case.","start":551.323,"stop":561.431,"duration":10.11},{"text":"The appellee here claims and indeed the District Court followed what they considered to be the law of the Ninth Circuit.","start":561.431,"stop":571.899,"duration":10.47},{"text":"And when this case reached the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit distinguished both of the cases and held that it was no question that this case was not the type of case which they relied upon.And now as to the merits themselves, well, I think first I have to -- I just notice here we have the problem that both sides are relying on United States against Mersky which is the recent case of this Court.","start":571.899,"stop":615.4,"duration":43.5},{"text":"And I would say that this case is certainly of course different.","start":615.4,"stop":624.303,"duration":8.9},{"text":"But on in each of these cases -- I mean in the Mersky case, it appeared that the previous cases of Hark and Murdock and Storrs were in bar and that it was clear that the manner in which the defendant frames his pleading is not determinative of whether or not it was actually a motion in bar.","start":624.303,"stop":649.329,"duration":25.03},{"text":"The critical factor is the effect of the ruling.","start":649.329,"stop":654.202,"duration":4.87},{"text":"On the other hand, the justices of this Court came to the diverging conclusion with respect to the type of ruling which would have the requisite effect.","start":654.202,"stop":667.031,"duration":12.83},{"text":"Justices Brennan and Justice Whitaker expressed the view that a judgment which will end of course an escapade of the defendant was sufficient to make it a motion in bar.","start":667.031,"stop":679.839,"duration":12.81},{"text":"Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, and Mr. Justice Harlan interpreted the pertinent jurisdiction in the ground of Section 3731 as limited to the old common law “special plead in bar.”","start":679.839,"stop":695.129,"duration":15.29},{"text":"And it was stated that it must be a plea in confession and avoidance which does not contest the facts of the indictment but relies on matters outside the indictment.","start":695.129,"stop":707.097,"duration":11.97},{"text":"And we say that the dimis -- dismissal of this indictment by the District Court satisfies both of these tests.","start":707.097,"stop":716.415,"duration":9.32},{"text":"And whichever way this Court reads the Mersky opinion as of this case, we think it is clear that the District Court was not only in error but that we come under Section 3731 and the case is properly here.","start":716.415,"stop":733.817,"duration":17.4},{"text":"We say that because we believe that the only reason for interpretation of the District Court ruling is that it is necessarily had the effect of permanently baring prosecution for income tax violation during that period of time from 1958 to 1961 and actually escapaded the appellee for any Internal Revenue charges during that period of time.","start":733.817,"stop":762.022,"duration":28.21},{"text":"And in view of the rejection of the Government's argument below and of its suggestion of an alternative remedy which is a motion to dismiss or any other kind of remedy other than to dismiss the indictment, the Court's dismissal in indictment was after it had intended to leave no means open to the Government by which indictment could be reinstated.","start":762.022,"stop":784.88,"duration":22.86},{"text":"And the cases relied on by appellees, there are cases of suppression of evidence, of evidence that could be produced and could make future trial possible.","start":784.88,"stop":797.543,"duration":12.66},{"text":"In this case, the only way that this man under the decision of the District Court here, the only way the appellee could be reindicted legally under this opinion would be to turn the clock back and not file the jeopardy assessment which has already been filed.","start":797.543,"stop":818.909,"duration":21.37}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"But General, only jurisdictional point of -- as -- if we could determine that this is subject to direct appeal, is there any kind of situation in which the indictment would be dismissed before a jeopardy of taxes which is not appealable here?","start":818.909,"stop":840.689,"duration":21.78}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"Oh yes sir, the ones where -- for example, the ones I can remember where a motion to suppress is made or the --","start":840.689,"stop":850.72,"duration":10.03}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"But that is not a disposition.","start":850.72,"stop":852.116,"duration":1.4},{"text":"That's not a dismissal of the indictment.","start":852.116,"stop":854.378,"duration":2.26}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, this is one case that they tried and they held that didn't' apply.","start":854.378,"stop":858.201,"duration":3.82}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"I know but any -- any order of the -- any plea which results has a direct result to the dismissal of the indictment rightly or wrongly under your theory would be appealable here, would be directly appealable here as a dismissal on the plea in bar provided it happened before jeopardy of tax.","start":858.201,"stop":882.547,"duration":24.35}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"No sir.","start":882.547,"stop":882.929,"duration":0.38},{"text":"To the contrary, one of the Ninth Circuit cases if I remember was where the Court ordered the District -- the U.S. Attorney to produce certain documents before trial and the claim was made that they couldn't find them or what have you.","start":882.929,"stop":902.488,"duration":19.56},{"text":"And the District Court says, “Well, the defendant cannot try this case without those.”","start":902.488,"stop":908.482,"duration":5.99},{"text":"And the indictment was dismissed and that held was held not to be a plea in bar because there was a possibility that they could eventually find them.","start":908.482,"stop":916.735,"duration":8.25},{"text":"And if ever they found those papers, they could retry.","start":916.735,"stop":921.747,"duration":5.01},{"text":"But there are still plenty of exceptions there.","start":921.747,"stop":924.064,"duration":2.32}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"But this does not fit in.","start":924.064,"stop":927.14,"duration":3.08},{"text":"You said few moments ago, if I correctly understand you, that the present case satisfies reasoning and both of the questions to which you referred in Mersky.","start":927.14,"stop":941.394,"duration":14.25}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, Mersky.","start":941.394,"stop":943.024,"duration":1.63}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"But is this -- is this the kind of thing that a common law would be recognized as a plea in

one, it's in confession and avoidance, and in two is bringing in material outside of the indictment itself.","start":951.326,"stop":960.259,"duration":8.93},{"text":"That's a classic one on back the old statute plea in bar.","start":960.259,"stop":965.932,"duration":5.67}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"What about if
