Illinois.","start":39.869,"stop":59.437,"duration":19.57},{"text":"Very briefly stated, and I will come back in a moment to give more detail.","start":59.437,"stop":66.197,"duration":6.76},{"text":"The ground for dismissal was that the plaintiff shareholder had filed a false verification required by Rule 23 (b) of the Federal Rule

matters which shall be set out in the complaint.","start":80.369,"stop":95.303,"duration":14.93},{"text":"The petitioner's view that this raises an important issue under the Federal Rules and one that goes far beyond the outcome of this particular case because it poses directly the question as to whether a procedural Rule can be used to impose upon admittedly a poorly educated and ignorant stockholder, a very substantial obstacles to her bringing a derivative suit where alleging misconduct on the part of officers and directors of the corporation in which she own stock.","start":95.303,"stop":130.059,"duration":34.76},{"text":"The record is clear that the petitioner here is a foreign-born, ill-educated seamstress in her mid 60s.","start":130.059,"stop":139.527,"duration":9.47},{"text":"As a matter of fact, the record on the deposition below indicate that she had difficulty in spelling her son-in-law's name, his name is Irving Brilliant.","start":139.527,"stop":148.995,"duration":9.47},{"text":"The complaint here was filed in December of 1963.","start":148.995,"stop":153.305,"duration":4.31},{"text":"It consists of 11 counts, eight of which alleged violations under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities of Exchange Act of 1934.","start":153.305,"stop":162.59,"duration":9.28},{"text":"Very briefly, it charges that the officers and directors who are named as defendants, wrongfully and in violation of the Securities Act made used of the corporation for the purpose of purchasing shares of stock of the corporation and also, Hilton Credit Corporation and that included in the shares of stock which were purchased were very large amounts of shares from the officers and directors themselves with the result that approximately $12 million of Hilton Hotels Corporation funds that were used for this purchases.","start":162.59,"stop":197.781,"duration":35.19},{"text":"Approximately $4,800,000, were used to purchase the shares of the officers and directors, and those funds were paid to those officers and directors for the purchase of their stock.","start":197.781,"stop":211.137,"duration":13.36},{"text":"The complaint is filed, was signed by three attorneys and it was verified by Mrs. Surowitz in accordance with the provisions of Rule 23 (b).","start":211.137,"stop":220.572,"duration":9.44},{"text":"She verified as true and correct, certain facts, very largely the facts of her stock ownership and the other facts which would indicate that she has standing or status to sue as a stockholder.","start":220.572,"stop":232.575,"duration":12},{"text":"The balance that is the charges of wrongdoings were verified by her on information and belief.","start":232.575,"stop":241.542,"duration":8.97},{"text":"Before answer was filed, the defendant moved to take Mrs. Surowitz's deposition.","start":241.542,"stop":246.872,"duration":5.33},{"text":"Upon receipt of that notice, we appeared in Court and asked the District Court to postpone the taking of the deposition until the defendants had filed some pleadings or answers so that we would have a better idea as to what issues might be raised.","start":246.872,"stop":260.334,"duration":13.46},{"text":"The District Court declined to postpone the deposition, and therefore, the deposition was taken in February of 1964 prior to any pleading having been filed by the defendants.","start":260.334,"stop":272.642,"duration":12.31},{"text":"The deposition was concluded and on the same afternoon, at approximately 3:30, as counsel for the petitioner, we were served with notice that on the next morning, the defendants would appear before the district judge and present a written motion.","start":272.642,"stop":288.441,"duration":15.8},{"text":"Now, the motion appears in the transcript of record at page 117.","start":288.441,"stop":293.934,"duration":5.49},{"text":"In that motion, two grounds were asserted for dismissal.","start":293.934,"stop":298.283,"duration":4.35},{"text":"One, that the pleading was a sham pleading; and secondly, that Mrs. Surowitz was not a proper party plaintiff.","start":298.283,"stop":305.849,"duration":7.57},{"text":"The following morning, when we appeared in Court, the defendants filed an affidavit which indicated that the records of the corporation showed that she had not become a stockholder of record until October of 1963 and this was presumably the basis for asserting that she was not a proper party plaintiff because she did not have the contemporaneous stock ownership required by Rule 23 (b).","start":305.849,"stop":331.831,"duration":25.98},{"text":"The district judge at that time initially was inclined to have the matter argued immediately but at our request, he gave us 15 days in which to file affidavits.","start":331.831,"stop":343.056,"duration":11.22},{"text":"In response to the motion therefore, we filed two affidavits, the affidavit of Irving Brilliant, Mrs. Surowitz's son-in-law, and the affidavit of Walter Rockler, one of the attorneys.","start":343.056,"stop":354.813,"duration":11.76},{"text":"The matter was argued later on March and the Court at the end argument announced the order would be one of dismissal.","start":354.813,"stop":363.305,"duration":8.49},{"text":"Thereafter, at the Court's request, counsel for the defendants' prepared detailed and lengthy findings of fact and conclusions of law which were discussed in Court on March the 27th and the order of dismissal was actually entered on March 30, 1964.","start":363.305,"stop":381.969,"duration":18.66},{"text":"In Mrs. Surowitz's deposition, she was able to testify that her son-in-law had purchased stock for her with her money and at one point, she indicated the stock was purchased in 1957.","start":381.969,"stop":394.308,"duration":12.34},{"text":"That in late 1962 or early 1963, she received certain communications from Hilton Hotels Corporation turned them over to her son-in-law and in effect asked him what they were all about.","start":394.308,"stop":413.146,"duration":18.84},{"text":"Now, later in March after a further discussion between Mrs. Surowitz and her son-in-law, he brought to her a letter of protest which is a document attached to the deposition.","start":413.146,"stop":427.664,"duration":14.52},{"text":"And in that letter of protest which she signed, stated that she opposed as improper the two stock purchase transactions which I have mentioned.","start":427.664,"stop":437.093,"duration":9.43},{"text":"In the summer of 1963, the dividend on Hilton Hotels Corporation was passed.","start":437.093,"stop":442.823,"duration":5.73},{"text":"She again spoke to her son-in-law.","start":442.823,"stop":445.068,"duration":2.25},{"text":"He advised her that he was looking into the matter and it was of the opinion that certain officers and directors had acted improperly.","start":445.068,"stop":451.692,"duration":6.62},{"text":"Subsequently, in December, the son-in-law brought the complaint to her which had been prepared by counsel in Chicago.","start":451.692,"stop":458.912,"duration":7.22},{"text":"He read and explained it to her, and following that, she signed the verification.","start":458.912,"stop":465.499,"duration":6.59},{"text":"The deposition also indicates and we do not dispute this at all that so far as her ability to explain or answer the basis for the complaint in the sense of articulating the facts or the basis for certain allegations, she was unable to do that.","start":465.499,"stop":483.287,"duration":17.79},{"text":"She answered repeatedly that she did not know.","start":483.287,"stop":486.023,"duration":2.74},{"text":"She could not say it on her own words.","start":486.023,"stop":488.232,"duration":2.21},{"text":"She did not understand.","start":488.232,"stop":489.951,"duration":1.72},{"text":"She didn't know.","start":489.951,"stop":490.827,"duration":0.88},{"text":"She left it to her son-in-law.","start":490.827,"stop":492.625,"duration":1.8},{"text":"She also stated, however, that she knew that her stock was not right and that she indicated that when the complaint was brought to her after these previous discussions that I've indicated following her son-in-law's explanation, she signed it.","start":492.625,"stop":510.809,"duration":18.18},{"text":"The affidavits of Mr. Brilliant and Mr. Rockler indicate, it seem to me beyond question that before this complaint was prepared and filed, a very substantial amount of investigatory in research work had been done both by Mr. Brilliant and by Mr. Rockler and his associates in Chicago.","start":510.809,"stop":529.44,"duration":18.63},{"text":"A great deal of effort was made to go to records, to track down transactions, to look at financial statements and so on, and those are set out in some detail.","start":529.44,"stop":541.437,"duration":12},{"text":"Mr. Brilliant also states in his affidavit that when he presented the complaint to his mother-in-law, Mrs. Surowitz, he told her that it represented the result of work that he had done and that the attorney in Chicago had done, and that it was his opinion that it was soundly based.","start":541.437,"stop":560.364,"duration":18.93},{"text":"I think it is important to note in this connection that Mr. Brilliant himself has legal training.","start":560.364,"stop":565.363,"duration":5},{"text":"He has acted as an investment counselor for a number of years and it is quite clear from the record, that since 1957 in connection with the small investment she has made, Mrs. Surowitz has relied upon her son-in-law for his recommendations and for his judgment.","start":565.363,"stop":582.361,"duration":17},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals in affirming, held at the verification was false and it held that it was false because in her deposition, Mrs. Surowitz indicated that she lacked requisite knowledge and understanding to know what she was verified.","start":582.361,"stop":601.03,"duration":18.67},{"text":"The actual words of the Court which I think are significant for purposes of the issue now here at the -- at record 237, the Court said, she lacked completely -- she completely lacked any knowledge of the basis of the complaint at the time when she signed the same and swore to the verity thereof.","start":601.03,"stop":620.724,"duration":19.69},{"text":"At the bottom of 235 and 36, the Court said that the verification requirement, that is Rule 23 (b), is designed to compel a plaintiff to begin such suit with sufficient knowledge of facts and information to show by his verification that there is a substantial basis to support the complaint which she made.","start":620.724,"stop":643.082,"duration":22.36},{"text":"It is our view that this is not a proper interpretation of Rule 23 (b) and that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed, primarily for two reasons.","start":643.082,"stop":653.977,"duration":10.89},{"text":"Rule 23 (b) is a procedural Rule.","start":653.977,"stop":657.193,"duration":3.22},{"text":"We believe that should be liberally construed particularly in light of the important public policy considerations where it's in -- where -- which is in -- which are involved in causes of action arising under the Securities Act and the intent of Congress that stockholders would act in effect as ancillary enforcers of those Acts.","start":657.193,"stop":680.091,"duration":22.9},{"text":"Secondly, we believe that if one studies the history of Rule 23 (b).","start":680.091,"stop":685.106,"duration":5.01},{"text":"It is quite clear that its principle purpose was to prevent collusive resort to the federal courts and that it was not intended and no Court has held that it was intended to impose a kind of comprehension test upon a plaintiff stockholder before that stockholder would have a right as the instigator to bring a corporate cause of action to Court.","start":685.106,"stop":709.055,"duration":23.95},{"text":"Very briefly, let me indicate why in the context of the facts here, we believe the public policy considerations are significant.","start":709.055,"stop":718.886,"duration":9.83},{"text":"It is no longer the case in this country that stocks are held only by a relatively limited class of persons.","start":718.886,"stop":726.547,"duration":7.66},{"text":"All the statistics indicate that stock ownership is becoming much more widespread.","start":726.547,"stop":731.587,"duration":5.04},{"text":"Significantly enough, the largest single group of stockowners in the United States today are housewives and unemployed women.","start":731.587,"stop":740.473,"duration":8.89},{"text":"Elderly women, in particular, hold substantial bodies and quantities of stock.","start":740.473,"stop":746.977,"duration":6.5},{"text":"The Securities Act, if one looks to the legislative history, were particularly designed to protect unknowledgeable, and gullible, and uninformed, and uneducated individuals who might invest in the stock market.","start":746.977,"stop":760.728,"duration":13.75},{"text":"Consequently to Rule -- to construe Rule 23 (b), as a qualification upon the comprehension of a stockholder before that stockholder can bring a derivative suit is very likely to bar the very individual sought to be protected by the Securities Act.","start":760.728,"stop":781.162,"duration":20.43},{"text":"Now, from coming to the courts at all with complaints based upon alleged wrongdoing by corporate officers and
