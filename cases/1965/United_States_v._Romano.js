unlikelihood that anyone other than those mentioned would be found at the still in light of the isolated location of such stills, the traditional secrecy of moonshine operation and the policy of

distinction is unimportant and I must say that counsel for respondents does not make anything of it, but on its face one might suppose that here there was no isolation in the same sense as in Gainey

Gainey.","start":584.939,"stop":597.975,"duration":13.04},{"text":"I need only to remind to the court that the building housing the still was firmly locked, but to approach it a curiosity seeker would

it was by accident.","start":597.975,"stop":628.639,"duration":30.66},{"text":"Now my opponent seems to suggest a reconsideration of Gainey recognizing its force in our case.","start":628.639,"stop":638.378,"duration":9.74},{"text":"I assume that, that decision rendered only last term is too recent to warrant by supposing that the Court would want to hear a

it.","start":649.424,"stop":659.992,"duration":10.57},{"text":"The issue here as I said is the constitutionality of two statutory presumptions quite comparable to that sustained in Gainey.","start":659.992,"stop":669.538,"duration":9.55},{"text":"Here, they involve presumptions applicable to the Crime of Possessing a still and to the crime of producing distilled spirits without a license.","start":669.538,"stop":680.757,"duration":11.22},{"text":"Whereas in Gainey, the offense and the presumption applicable to it was carrying on the business of the distiller without a bond.","start":680.757,"stop":690.842,"duration":10.09},{"text":"In light of the Gainey ruling, the only real question here is whether these offenses, like the offense of carrying on the business involved in Gainey is also all comprehensive, so as to include everyone likely to be found at the site of the still.","start":690.842,"stop":712.147,"duration":21.31},{"text":"If so, then the inference which the statute permits from presence at the site is rational and constitutional as it was in Gainey.","start":712.147,"stop":722.438,"duration":10.29},{"text":"If the substantive offenses here on the contrary are much narrower, then we cannot sustain the rationality of the statutory presumption.","start":722.438,"stop":737.148,"duration":14.71},{"text":"Before discussing each of the substantive offenses here and their relative broadness, it may be important to say and to emphasize that the three crimes involved, the two here and the one in Gainey are not wholly overlapping.","start":737.148,"stop":761.299,"duration":24.15},{"text":"If they were, that would tend to make nonsense out of the congressional scheme.","start":761.299,"stop":766.876,"duration":5.58},{"text":"It would be difficult to understand why Congress had written three provisions which in all circumstances covered the identical conduct by the same people.","start":766.876,"stop":778.594,"duration":11.72},{"text":"Moreover if that was the fact, we would confront problems of election and accumulation of sentences.","start":778.594,"stop":786.601,"duration":8.01},{"text":"They are important differences between the three crimes, albeit we say they are all three broad crimes.","start":786.601,"stop":795,"duration":8.4},{"text":"The offense of possession of an unregistered still unlike the other two production and carrying on the business even expanded as we said was in 1958, probably encompasses only persons physically connected with the skill -- with the distill, whose proximity to the still is immediate.","start":795,"stop":820.37,"duration":25.37},{"text":"That is clearly not true of the offense of carrying on the business nor is it true of the crime production.","start":820.37,"stop":826.886,"duration":6.52},{"text":"Here the two the co-defendants who were not found at the still were convicted of
