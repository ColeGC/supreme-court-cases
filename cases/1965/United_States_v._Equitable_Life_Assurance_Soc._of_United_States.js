$66.","start":341.16,"stop":361.691,"duration":20.53},{"text":"This Court has long recognized that the uniform application of the federal tax law and the protection of federal revenues requires that

recognize as this Court has that in the absence of federal standards, the inevitable and natural tendency of the states would be to give precedence to state created liens running in favor of local

home.","start":379.931,"stop":411.524,"duration":31.59},{"text":"Accordingly to avoid the unequal application of the federal tax laws and to protect federal revenues from being whittled away, the

subsequent and inchoate liens.","start":411.524,"stop":440.8,"duration":29.28},{"text":"A corollary of that rule is that subsequently perfected liens do not relate back to the time of their creation

here in the Pioneer American Insurance Company case three years ago.","start":465.269,"stop":478.029,"duration":12.76},{"text":"Pioneer involved a mortgage that provided in terms that a reasonable attorney's fee shall be added to the principle sum and shall be secured by the instrument in the event of foreclosure.","start":478.029,"stop":492.919,"duration":14.89},{"text":"The Court held that where federal tax liens were accorded after the mortgage, after default, after the commencement of the foreclosure proceedings but before the entry of judgment fixing the amount of the attorney's fees such tax liens were entitled to priority over the lien for counsel fees.","start":492.919,"stop":515.599,"duration":22.68},{"text":"The Court likened the mortgagee's lien for counsel fees to a lien to
