70 (c), Congress had given that definition and broaden up terms so that the trustee in bankruptcy as Judge Sullivan quote as clearly his words can state the trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to all of the rights of a “judgment creditor” although, obviously, he is not one and that language he quoted from the concurring opinion of Judge Hamley of the Ninth Circuit in the other conflict case of

in favor of a strict construction of a “judgment creditor” in aid of the collection of taxes.","start":2301.118,"stop":2329.819,"duration":28.7},{"text":"We have relied upon reports of the bankruptcy

trustee.","start":2337.268,"stop":2354.944,"duration":17.68},{"text":"These committee statements, I think, have to be somewhat of a stand off and the legislative history which has had in this statutes since about 1910, a provision that trustee and bankruptcy shall be considered as if you were a “judgment creditor” as well as the present form which grants to the trustee in bankruptcy rights well beyond those of a “judgment creditor” because in some states and in particular in Ohio, a “judgment creditor” is not a lien holder until a certificate of judgment is filed or until a levy of execution is filed, so that the rights of a “judgment creditor” in Ohio are substantially less than the rights of a creditor holding a lien by legal or equitable proceedings.","start":2354.944,"stop":2407.848,"duration":52.9},{"text":"Government makes reference to the practical effect of the ruling and of the statute and makes the point that in this case, the

creditors and unsecured creditors which have no priority.","start":2426.646,"stop":2437.468,"duration":10.82},{"text":"Now, state and federal taxes are given a priority over other unsecured creditors under 64 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act.","start":2437.468,"stop":2447.272,"duration":9.8},{"text":"The result is that in this case the Federal Government shared with the state taxing agencies in the dividend which was proposed, the 53% dividend, and that represents just exactly what the purpose of Section 70 (c) is and that is to bring the right of an unsecured creditor ahead of a creditor claiming a secret lien.","start":2447.272,"stop":2485.667,"duration":38.39},{"text":"I think with respect to the practical effects, we always come down to the very simple answer, that the only thing that the Government has to do to protect itself completely in this type of situation is to file its notice and when that notice is filed mortgagees, pledgees, judgment creditors, trustee in bankruptcy are all subsequent in their priority to the federal tax lien.","start":2485.667,"stop":2515.974,"duration":30.31},{"text":"I think, probably, the arguments in favor of trustees' position as the

effect or other collateral sources.","start":2532.5,"stop":2553.775,"duration":21.28},{"text":"But proper construction is possible from a simple reading of their
