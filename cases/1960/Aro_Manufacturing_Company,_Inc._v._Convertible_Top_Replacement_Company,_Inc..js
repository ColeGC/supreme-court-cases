car.","start":669.96,"stop":675.426,"duration":5.47},{"text":"Now, prior to the Mackie-Duluk invention, fabrics which were used in inconvertible cars were typically shaped so that they terminated in his Rear Quarter section, immediately adjacent or above the belt line of the car.","start":675.426,"stop":688.108,"duration":12.68},{"text":"And they habitually had some sort of manual fasteners on

fold your convertible top up, even after the top had been completely closed over the car, someone had to get out of the car and walk around in the side of the car and actually snap this fasteners in

shrinkage in this region.","start":751.924,"stop":756.248,"duration":4.32},{"text":"Since the fabric material in the Rear Quarter section was loose, we found that often after a limited period of usage, even though the top was in fine condition, the material had shrunk a little bit in this region so that even when you tried to pull the fasteners down, you just couldn't quite reach the belt line.","start":756.248,"stop":771.881,"duration":15.63},{"text":"And as a result, you just couldn't make a seal at all in this region of the car and you had some loose flaps so that wind or snow or

problem of so-called, unauthorized access.","start":779.844,"stop":788.757,"duration":8.91},{"text":"A convertible car can never be reliably locked even now because the top can be slashed, but it was very easy to get into convertible cars prior to 1950, simply because anybody who wanted to get into the car, even when the doors were locked and the window's completely closed, could merely unsnap
