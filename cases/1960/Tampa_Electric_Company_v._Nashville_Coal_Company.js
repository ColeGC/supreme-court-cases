1955.","start":240.06,"stop":265.226,"duration":25.17},{"text":"Tampa, the petitioner was to build a new plant, the Gannon Station initially with two coal burning units ultimately possibly with six

basis of the decision below was that the contract violated the Act because it embraced the total requirements, the first two coal burning units and such other coal burning units at Gannon Station as might be constructed to burn coal and that that was an enormous market with huge quantity of coal.","start":373.336,"stop":396.441,"duration":23.1},{"text":"Now Your Honors, I think are familiar with the purpose of Section C of the Clayton Act that disclosed by the statutory history, an Act of 1914 largely because at that time, they have grown up throughout the country the practice whereby large manufacturers and sellers who owned or control some particularly desirable article of commerce sought to tie up the resale or retail outlet for their goods over a large portion of the country as they could by selling their desirable product only on the condition that the purchaser would not deal with their competitors.","start":396.441,"stop":439.987,"duration":43.55},{"text":"The classic example was the International Shoe Company which possessed the patent that made it so much cheaper to manufacture shoes that no shoemaker could operate unless he had their patent.","start":439.987,"stop":454.914,"duration":14.93},{"text":"So they made a condition that they wouldn't license anyone to use their patent any shoemaker unless he also ordered leather in his last and everything else that he could use in making shoes, permitted International Shoe.","start":454.914,"stop":466.209,"duration":11.3},{"text":"And as the senate report pointed under its bill, there as a result, was impossible drainage more shoemaker anywhere in the country to operate unless he bought everything from International Shoe, they have the fact they have monopoly across that contract is what is commonly known as a time contract.","start":466.209,"stop":483.985,"duration":17.78},{"text":"The Act also forbids contracts which merely require that the purchaser shall buy all of the particular type of goods from the seller.","start":483.985,"stop":495.952,"duration":11.97},{"text":"It stand as examples there to dress fashion cases, standard fashion, fashion designer's guild where they sold these specialized fashion -- dress fashions that had a trade name and a value only on condition that the stores use them -- showed them would not display or use any other maker patents in their stores.","start":495.952,"stop":525.589,"duration":29.64},{"text":"More recent case of that type of exclusive-dealing agreement frequently referred to as the requirements contract is the Standard Oil of California case in which Standard Oil of California and its leading competitors sold oil, sold gasoline and oil to filling stations in the western seven States, Western Area, it only dealt with the seven States, Western Area because that was the only area in which Standard operated on the condition that the filling stations would not sell any other oil but Standard's or if its competitors -- of its competitors.","start":525.589,"stop":564.451,"duration":38.86},{"text":"The result of Standard tied up some 6,000 retailers in that area all with these requirements contracts.","start":564.451,"stop":571.32,"duration":6.87},{"text":"Now, of course those contracts were -- they didn't say you may not deal with our competitors like the fashion one contract said you can't sell somebody else's fashion but this merely said you must buy all your gasoline from Standard, but it had exactly the same effect.","start":571.32,"stop":590.493,"duration":19.17},{"text":"Now, there was where the type of contracts, type of transactions that Congress was directing its attention to when it's enacted Section 3 of the Clayton Act.","start":590.493,"stop":601.022,"duration":10.53},{"text":"And it's apparent from the debates of Congress what they objected to was a powerful manufacturer with leverage, economic leverage grow over the buyer, compelling the buyer if he wanted to deal with his goods at all, if he wanted to sell Standard gasoline to just buy nothing but Standard gasoline and that it was applicable only when they were trying to tie up the resale-retail outlets for their goods.","start":601.022,"stop":631.98,"duration":30.96},{"text":"Now, if you examine the Act again for a moment on page 2, you'll see that it was carefully drawn to carry out just that type of a prohibition.","start":631.98,"stop":640.921,"duration":8.94},{"text":"It shall be unlawful for any person to make a sale or contract of sale of goods, or fix a price or a rebate on such price, on the understanding or agreement that the lessee or purchaser shall not deal in the goods of a competitor or competitor of the substance.","start":640.921,"stop":659.86,"duration":18.94},{"text":"That's the language you would use if you're trying to say you can't impose an exclusive dealing condition on the buyer as a condition to his buying your product.","start":659.86,"stop":674.021,"duration":14.16},{"text":"The case -- the Act has been reviewed some 19 cases and various courts which is cited in the briefs, eight and nine I think in this Court and in everyone of those cases, a powerful seller with an economic leverage due either to a patent or to control or they trade name (Inaudible), Standard Gas, Standard Fashion, and so forth, imposed conditions to exclusive dealing on a substantial segment of the resale market for their product.","start":674.021,"stop":709.406,"duration":35.38},{"text":"As I said 6,000 retailers in the Western Area in Standard, 60% of the clothing manufacturers are better more expensive ladies dresses, in Standard Fashions, and so forth.","start":709.406,"stop":721.645,"duration":12.24},{"text":"In every case, moreover, the contract was based either expressly on a condition that the purchaser wouldn't deal with the seller's competitors or was of the type of requirements contract which had precisely the same effect.","start":721.645,"stop":739.045,"duration":17.4},{"text":"You must buy all your requirements from us or not.","start":739.045,"stop":743.344,"duration":4.3},{"text":"That did not violate the Act.","start":743.344,"stop":746.488,"duration":3.14},{"text":"As Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in the Standard Oil case, a dealer who has entered into a requirements contact with Standard, that's the one that said you can't buy any gas from anyone else, cannot consistently with that contract sell the petroleum products of a competitor of Standard no matter how many pumps he has.","start":746.488,"stop":765.778,"duration":19.29},{"text":"And in every case, the Stan -- the seller had this economic leverage that's pointed out and in every case it tied up this large area of resale outlets.","start":765.778,"stop":779.635,"duration":13.86},{"text":"Now, it's my contention also in every case, the decree of the Court was directed exclusively against the seller.","start":779.635,"stop":787.25,"duration":7.62},{"text":"It was the seller against whom the Act was directed, the Act of it was saying divulge contract to be in that merely says a person shall not make a sale on this condition.","start":787.25,"stop":798.874,"duration":11.62},{"text":"So there never before has been a case in which the Act was directed against anyone but the seller to prevent him from imposing this exclusive dealing condition.","start":798.874,"stop":808.854,"duration":9.98},{"text":"Now, I think it's fairly apparent that the Act we have here before is -- it doesn't contain anyone of the four criteria which this Court has relied on and the other courts have relied on, and which Congress had in mind when they adopted the Act.","start":808.854,"stop":827.705,"duration":18.85},{"text":"In the first place, because it's obvious, this contract doesn't contain any express condition that the purchaser shall not deal in the goods of the seller's patents.","start":827.705,"stop":837.254,"duration":9.55},{"text":"It merely says that the seller will sale and the goods that were purchased, all of its requirements for the first two units and six other units of this one station as may be constructed as coal burning units during the first 10 years of the contract.","start":837.254,"stop":853.657,"duration":16.4},{"text":"That is not the equivalent of the type of exclusive dealing contract that said you can't buy anything from anybody else.","start":853.657,"stop":862.29,"duration":8.63},{"text":"Proof of it is, we are now purchasing oil -- merely a competitor of coal and boiler fuel in 11 oil burning units on Tampa Bay all integrated units producing electricity on the same wire and we can -- we have a perfect right to construct additional units of Gannon oil burning or gas burning units, thus dealing with coal's competitor of oil.","start":862.29,"stop":886.935,"duration":24.64}]},{"speakerName":"Charles E.

concept.","start":893.719,"stop":894.476,"duration":0.76},{"text":"This contract doesn't forbid us to burn all the oil we want even in Gannon Station except in those the first two units and such other units as we designate this coal burning -- so it's not a requirement, full requirement's contract at all.","start":894.476,"stop":910.576,"duration":16.1},{"text":"The limited possible requirements contract limited to those new units in which we burn the coal.","start":910.576,"stop":918.495,"duration":7.92},{"text":"Actually, for that reason it seems to me it's really more like the contract for a fixed amount of oil -- of coal.","start":918.495,"stop":925.84,"duration":7.35},{"text":"Because everybody knows that the amount of coal burned in the particular unit can be told within 5% or 10%.","start":925.84,"stop":934.568,"duration":8.73},{"text":"When it's constructed, it's usually constructed to burn so many tons and then when it starts, it burns a little more or a little less.","start":934.568,"stop":940.741,"duration":6.17},{"text":"And then of course you can't tell practically how much demand there will be so that they like a little flexibility.","start":940.741,"stop":946.679,"duration":5.94},{"text":"Therefore, they make it a requirement's contract but it's only in the limited requirements of this one -- these two original units, not to fill the third coal burning unit, but as I say, they can burn oil in the future units and they're now burning oil.","start":946.679,"stop":961.721,"duration":15.04},{"text":"Now my friend says and the court below held that oil and coal are separate lines of commerce.","start":961.721,"stop":968.117,"duration":6.4},{"text":"Well, I point out that the basic clause of the Clayton Act doesn't say any thing about line of commerce.","start":968.117,"stop":974.344,"duration":6.23},{"text":"It says, \"that the seller may not deal with the goods of the seller and purchaser, he may not deal in the goods of the seller's competitors.","start":974.344,"stop":982.19,"duration":7.85},{"text":"Coal is a competitor of a seller.","start":982.19,"stop":983.949,"duration":1.76},{"text":"The word line of commerce comes in only in the qualifying clause and I'll come to that later.","start":983.949,"stop":988.961,"duration":5.01},{"text":"However, let's assume that coals oil are separate line of commerce.","start":988.961,"stop":994.629,"duration":5.67},{"text":"We can burn coal in any of the oil burning units that we are -- where we are now burning oil and although of my friend and the court below say that that's a very unrealistic approach, the record shows that as soon as we began operating Gannon Station, the first unit there as the coal burning station and it was shown that coal could be brought down the Ohio river by barge across the Gulf of Mexico and to Florida, thereby breaking in to oil's monopoly, one of the respondent's principle competitors, the Peabody Coal company wrote to my client to Tampa, and formally offered to supply coal for two of the oil burning units who then were burning oil on Tampa Bay if Tampa would convert those units to coal.","start":994.629,"stop":1044.012,"duration":49.38},{"text":"Thereupon, -- first, when the Tampa may interrupt with his oil suppliers and they reduced their price of oil.","start":1044.012,"stop":1051.672,"duration":7.66},{"text":"That's how begins the competition, this type of contract is.","start":1051.672,"stop":1055.831,"duration":4.16},{"text":"Coal was brought in to Florida, the price of oil dropped.","start":1055.831,"stop":1059.827,"duration":4},{"text":"Now, the only reason we're not burning coal right now at this very moment, purchased from their competitors in Tampa to produce our electricity has nothing to do with the restrictive conditions of this contract.","start":1059.827,"stop":1072.578,"duration":12.75},{"text":"It is the free act -- action of free and open competition.","start":1072.578,"stop":1077.412,"duration":4.83},{"text":"The moment Peabody Coal Company or some other coal company can offer us coal at a price that is competing with the present price of oil and oil people don't reduce their price any further, we are going to obviously convert and buy coal.","start":1077.412,"stop":1091.013,"duration":13.6},{"text":"We have to because we have to produce electricity at the cheapest rate, we are bound to.","start":1091.013,"stop":1095.769,"duration":4.76},{"text":"So that we are all free under this contract to buy, burn coal and buy coal from their competitors right now.","start":1095.769,"stop":1104.169,"duration":8.4},{"text":"In other words, it seems to me obviously that this contract doesn't and can't come within the basic clause of the Clayton -- of Section 3 of the Clayton Act because it doesn't prevent the purchasers from dealing in the goods of the seller's competitors and it's no use to say that the courts below did -- my adversary says \"Oh but it does cover a very large quantity of coal because like any utility, we burn a lot of coal to produce our electricity\" ultimately it may be a million or even more tons a year, the whole thing gets going.","start":1104.169,"stop":1143.72,"duration":39.55},{"text":"The Clayton Act doesn't forbid a contract for the large -- sale of a large number of goods, large quantity of goods.","start":1143.72,"stop":1150.473,"duration":6.75},{"text":"It only forbids the contract based on the condition that the buyer won't deal in the goods in the seller's competitors and this contract, of course, doesn't have any such effect at all.","start":1150.473,"stop":1161.724,"duration":11.25},{"text":"Now the second criteria, also the statutory history and decided cases which I've just referred in determining illegality under Section 3 of the Clayton Act is the question of whether the seller has leverage, economic leverage sufficient to impose the condition on the purchaser.","start":1161.724,"stop":1185.402,"duration":23.68},{"text":"The importance of that is very well express I think in Mr. Justice Black's opinion in Northern Pacific Railway of the United States be sure that dealt with the tying contract when it came up under the Sherman Act, the effect, the remarks are jointly after they were here.","start":1185.402,"stop":1204.449,"duration":19.05},{"text":"In discussing this issue of the seller having economic leverage is 356 U.S. at page 6 and 7.","start":1204.449,"stop":1213.821,"duration":9.37},{"text":"Now of course where the seller has no control or dominance over the tying product so that it does not represent in the factual weapon to pressure buyers into taking the tying requirement, any restraint of trade attribute -- attributable to set tying arrangements would obviously be insignificant at most.","start":1213.821,"stop":1233.182,"duration":19.36},{"text":"As a simple example, if one of a dozen food stores in the community where they refuse to sell flour, unless the buyer took sugar, it would hardly taint to restraint competition in sugar if its competitors were ready and able to sell flour by itself.","start":1233.182,"stop":1248.668,"duration":15.49},{"text":"Now, the same would be true if he said \"I won't sell you any flour unless you ready buy all of your flour from me” and the other stores say \"Oh we'll sell whatever flour you ask for.","start":1248.668,"stop":1260.64,"duration":11.97},{"text":"Now, it's conceded on the record in this case that there were 700 coal dealers in the Appalachian coal fields in Ohio, West Virginia

else\".","start":1278.14,"stop":1293.907,"duration":15.77},{"text":"The only reason this contract was made as a requirement's contract -- it's perfectly well understandable business reason which Mr. Justice Harlan called attention to in the Mobil case seven years ago that when you are converting from one fuel to another, it is necessary to have a long-term requirements contract to make it economically feasible to invest large sums necessary to construct plant and in that case was also related to conversion.","start":1293.907,"stop":1325.58,"duration":31.67},{"text":"The record shows

record shows also that these respondents had to invest upwards of $7.5 million, I believe it's -- I'm told now it's $9 million in building barges to come down the Ohio river and the Mississippi river

dock.","start":1334.869,"stop":1363.254,"duration":28.38},{"text":"Now, nobody's going to go into those that type of a long term investment and then say \"Well, now I want to go out and see where I
