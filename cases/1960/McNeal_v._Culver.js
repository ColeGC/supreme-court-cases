position.","start":54.936,"stop":60.722,"duration":5.79},{"text":"First, it is our contention that under the decisions of this Court, due process requires the State to offer or furnish counsel to a prisoner in a noncapital case whenever there are special circumstances which show that without representation by counsel, the petitioner or the prisoner cannot have a fair and adequate defense.","start":60.722,"stop":90.69,"duration":29.97},{"text":"In turning to the special circumstances which we contend exists in the present record, we say that there are six.","start":90.69,"stop":99.854,"duration":9.16},{"text":"They are these, first, ignorance, second, mental illness, third, complicated substantive issues involved in the trial, fourth, difficult evidentiary problems, fifth, the use of inadmissible testimony, entirely prejudicial testimony to convict and sixth, the fact that the unrepresented petitioner received no aid from the trial judge in guiding him pass the errors which make trial without counsel unfair.","start":99.854,"stop":134.336,"duration":34.48},{"text":"The issue comes to this Court in the following
