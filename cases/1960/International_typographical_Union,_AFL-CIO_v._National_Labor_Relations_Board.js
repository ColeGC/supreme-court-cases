agreement in effect.","start":251.239,"stop":257.344,"duration":6.1},{"text":"The employer by his unilateral choice had a union foreman and he delegated to that union foreman exactly the powers which the contract proposals asked that foreman exercise.","start":257.344,"stop":271.897,"duration":14.55},{"text":"Now, the union's proposals, as I have said, called for nondiscriminatory standards of hiring.","start":271.897,"stop":279.243,"duration":7.35},{"text":"What the union was therefore proposing was that though there had been up to that time a complete delegation of authority to the foreman by the employer's unilateral act, the union was proposing in the contracts which it presented the setting up of nondiscriminatory standards for hire which would be, as I have suggested binding on the employer.","start":279.243,"stop":302.534,"duration":23.29},{"text":"This we say is clearly in aid of the statutory purpose.","start":302.534,"stop":306.373,"duration":3.84},{"text":"There was

Haverhill there was not even an objection to this clause being -- going into the agreement.","start":321.53,"stop":327.057,"duration":5.53},{"text":"And in both cases, therefore, the union made no

him.","start":327.057,"stop":346.949,"duration":19.89},{"text":"Now with respect to the laws clause, the uncertainty argument, there is one additional point which I would like to draw to the Court's attention.","start":346.949,"stop":354.613,"duration":7.66},{"text":"The Board's traditional technique and the notices which it directs to be posted, always declare that the parties are not to violate

all of the doctrinal law with reference to dual union membership, payment of dues, check off arrangements, and the myriad other subjects with which the Board is dealt.","start":370.703,"stop":385.18,"duration":14.48},{"text":"The Board is entirely satisfied with this kind of an arrangement and we have suggested that the words not in conflict with law in the laws clause are at least as reassuring to employees as technical language such as except to the extent permitted by Section 8 (a) (3).","start":385.18,"stop":404.292,"duration":19.11},{"text":"As Chief Judge Prettyman noted in the Honolulu Star case, the Board twice in a notice to all employees which it required to be posted, directs the company to recite adjuration of certain activities “except to the extent permitted by Section 8 (a) (3) of the Act”.","start":404.292,"stop":422.264,"duration":17.97},{"text":"Counsel pointed the queries whether the latter quoted expression is less confusing than the phrase “not in conflict with law”.","start":422.264,"stop":431.357,"duration":9.09},{"text":"We suggest to Your Honors that in the drafting of a contract, we're within our rights in using a shorthand device, precisely the kind which the Board itself uniformly uses in the notices to employees which it directs to the posting.","start":431.357,"stop":448.75,"duration":17.39},{"text":"Your Honors have had represented to you here in the course of the argument in the Local 357 case that the Mountain Pacific doctrine is applicable solely to exclusively union operated hiring halls.","start":448.75,"stop":462.866,"duration":14.12},{"text":"Now, in the News Syndicate case, the hiring in that case was done by a foreman on the employer's premises.","start":462.866,"stop":470.032,"duration":7.17},{"text":"There was no hiring hall exclusive or non-exclusive.","start":470.032,"stop":474.198,"duration":4.17},{"text":"The Board nevertheless attempted to apply its Mountain Pacific doctrine in that News Syndicate case to a case where there was no kind of hiring hall whatsoever.","start":474.198,"stop":486.057,"duration":11.86},{"text":"And despite the representations which were made in the courts below and in this Court that Mountain Pacific is a doctrine which is limited solely to hiring halls.","start":486.057,"stop":496.58,"duration":10.52},{"text":"We have suggested in our brief that the only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the Board is unable to distinguish between a foreman and the hiring hall.","start":496.58,"stop":506.507,"duration":9.93},{"text":"I suggest to Your Honors that in the cases you have heard here in the last days, there is one common thread which runs through them all and which we think is dispositive of all.","start":506.507,"stop":518.063,"duration":11.56},{"text":"And that is the question whether or not unions and union members are entitled to the normal presumption of law that if they have a power, they will exercise it lawfully.","start":518.063,"stop":530.808,"duration":12.75},{"text":"The Board's approach in all of these matters is to start with the assumption that if a union is given a power whether it is a power over seniority, over apprenticeships, over methods of hire, over a hiring hall, over a foreman, that those powers will probably be exercised in unlawful fashion, that therefore the Board can assert a right to strike down these powers in the hands of the union.","start":530.808,"stop":561.64,"duration":30.83},{"text":"For example, if we had undertaken to follow the technique which the Board used here in its hiring hall cases, we would have searched the Board's records for 300 or 400 cases in which nonunion foremen have discriminated against nonunion members.","start":561.64,"stop":580.029,"duration":18.39},{"text":"We would then add an elaborate tribute to our own expertise and we'd say that this demonstrates conclusively that the only reason that employers hire nonunion foremen is in order that they may discriminate against union members and hiring.","start":580.029,"stop":595.632,"duration":15.6},{"text":"We would then use this as a basis for asserting that we had the power to forbid the employer to hire a nonunion foreman and having the power to forbid him to do so, we could impose any conditions that we like on the employer's hiring of a nonunion foreman.","start":595.632,"stop":611.782,"duration":16.15},{"text":"Once you start with the presumption that unions and union members are as intent on obeying the law as employers are, then the resting of power in unions to control certain industrial matters presents no further problem.","start":611.782,"stop":629.074,"duration":17.29},{"text":"We say that as citizens, we are entitled to the benefit of this presumption as much as an employer, a nonunion foreman or anyone else.","start":629.074,"stop":668.981,"duration":39.91}]}]},{"transcriptTitle":"Oral Argument - March

background.","start":116.268,"stop":122.409,"duration":6.14},{"text":"In 1957, the Board had before it a report of a trial examiner which found that a contract substantially similar to the contract proposals made by the unions here was lawful and that the practices under that contract had been lawful.","start":122.409,"stop":140.905,"duration":18.5},{"text":"The Board at that time took no issue

agreement were unlawful.","start":154.569,"stop":160.935,"duration":6.37},{"text":"It did, however, set the contract aside as being an unlawful close chart.","start":160.935,"stop":166.8,"duration":5.87},{"text":"Now in that case, the contract contained on its face a provision which said that the term journeyman and apprentice has used herein, that is in the agreement, shall not be taken to refer exclusively to members of the International Typographical Union.","start":166.8,"stop":182.91,"duration":16.11},{"text":"Now manifestly, the parties are not required as a condition of maintaining lawful agreements to negative on their face and intention to discriminate.","start":182.91,"stop":191.201,"duration":8.29},{"text":"This would be tantamount to saying that every commercial agreement violates the antitrust acts which fails to state on its face that the parties do not intend to violate the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts.","start":191.201,"stop":203.516,"duration":12.31},{"text":"But in this case, the parties had taken this additional step which we think is not required by the statute.","start":203.516,"stop":209.459,"duration":5.94},{"text":"There was a showing that a substantial number of nonunion men had actually been hired.","start":209.459,"stop":215.095,"duration":5.64},{"text":"The Board nonetheless treated it as a closed-shop agreement.","start":215.095,"stop":218.936,"duration":3.84},{"text":"And the case is instructive, I suggest, is demonstrating the way in which the Board is prepared to toss the epithet closed-shop around as a substitute for evidence and findings.","start":218.936,"stop":230.944,"duration":12.01},{"text":"The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had no trouble with the

certiorari.","start":237.752,"stop":240.166,"duration":2.41},{"text":"And as Your Honors have just heard after the most careful scrutiny, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in News Syndicate found that contracts which have been in effect for some years substantially identical with the proposals herein made by the local unions, had been lawfully administered.","start":240.166,"stop":258.613,"duration":18.45},{"text":"Now, I stress that this is a completely random sample.","start":258.613,"stop":262.064,"duration":3.45},{"text":"These cases

contrary clearly appears and in this case, there is nothing whatsoever to the contract.","start":286.249,"stop":295.756,"duration":9.51},{"text":"The local negotiators at all times insisted that their contract proposals were lawful and that they intended that they'd be lawfully applied.","start":295.756,"stop":305.145,"duration":9.39},{"text":"The significant difference obviously between these three cases and the case that bar here is that here we deal with proposals made in the course of collective negotiations rather than with agreements which had been in effect for some years so that actual practices under those agreements could be reviewed.","start":305.145,"stop":323.875,"duration":18.73},{"text":"The Board and the court below were therefore constrained to indulge in some
