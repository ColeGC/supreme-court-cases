proceed.","start":0,"stop":2.537,"duration":2.54}]},{"speakerName":"Joseph Forer","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honor.","start":2.537,"stop":5.414,"duration":2.88},{"text":"I was saying at the recess that in order to meet the statutory requirement, that a suppression had procured denaturalization.","start":5.414,"stop":15.867,"duration":10.45},{"text":"It follows as logically and inevitably that you have to show one of two things.","start":15.867,"stop":24.023,"duration":8.16},{"text":"Either that the true facts, if disclosed, within themselves have justified the naturalizing court in denying naturalization under the then applicable standards of naturalization or two, that the true facts, if disclosed, would have led to the discovery of other facts, which if known, would have justified the naturalizing court in denying naturalization.","start":24.023,"stop":54.581,"duration":30.56},{"text":"Now, if I'm right and this becomes a crucial issue, then you can't say that a person shall be denaturalized because the suppressed facts, which if disclosed, might have or would have led to an investigation.","start":54.581,"stop":74.149,"duration":19.57},{"text":"Because if I am right, you'll also have to then go on and show that the investigation would have discovered facts which would have justify denaturalization or which you have justified a refusal of naturalization.","start":74.149,"stop":90.073,"duration":15.92},{"text":"If the investigation would have been fruitless, in the sense that it would not have discovered anything to the man's discredit or would not have discovered anything that would have justified denial of naturalization, then the investigation has nothing to do with whether he got naturalization or didn't get naturalization, it therefore has no bearing on whether or not denaturalization was procured by the misrepresentation.","start":90.073,"stop":119.62,"duration":29.55},{"text":"And I -- I think if we will see, that is the principal issue between my position and the opposition of the court below.","start":119.62,"stop":128.586,"duration":8.97},{"text":"And I think my position follows, not only from the language of the statute which says that you can denaturalize only if naturalization was procured by the suppression, but it also follows from the principle which this Court has repeatedly announced, which is in substance that in a denaturalization case, the defendant, denaturalized citizen is given every possible benefit, both on the facts and on the law.","start":128.586,"stop":162.592,"duration":34.01},{"text":"And I think that's particularly important, in view of the fact that there seems to be no statute of limitations and no rule of laches so as to prevent the Government from bringing stale cases many years after naturalization was obtained.","start":162.592,"stop":181.184,"duration":18.59},{"text":"Now, I think it is apparent that if my test of materiality, which I think is the statutory test, is applied to this case, then the -- the judgment below was wrong in holding that the petitioner was rightly denaturalized on the arrest ground.","start":181.184,"stop":202.785,"duration":21.6},{"text":"If you'll look at the statute which set the rules at the time of naturalization, namely the 1906 Naturalization Act, there was only one ground which had any possible relevance to the subject of arrest.","start":202.785,"stop":221.468,"duration":18.68},{"text":"And that was the requirement of the statute that before an alien could be naturalized, he had to be -- be a person who had behaved for the five preceding years as a person of -- of good moral character and attached to the Constitution.","start":221.468,"stop":240.422,"duration":18.95},{"text":"Now, it is perfectly clear that if you use the first branch of my test, that if these arrests had been disclosed, they would not have justified the naturalizing court in holding that the then alien did not meet the requirement of five years good character.","start":240.422,"stop":262.465,"duration":22.04},{"text":"First of all, the arrests were remote.","start":262.465,"stop":264.194,"duration":1.73},{"text":"They were 10 years before the petition not within the five-year period.","start":264.194,"stop":269.214,"duration":5.02},{"text":"Secondly, they had no application to a man's character anyway, since they were for trivial offenses, did not result in convictions and at least two of them were -- were unconstitutional offenses.","start":269.214,"stop":283.358,"duration":14.14},{"text":"And the Court of Appeals did not claim and did not hold that the arrest, if they had been divulged, would have justified the denial of naturalization.","start":283.358,"stop":293.882,"duration":10.52},{"text":"So, I think we can -- I can get safely pass the first prong of my test of materiality.","start":293.882,"stop":301.739,"duration":7.86},{"text":"This leads to the next -- the next branch of my test, and that is, did the suppression of the arrest result in suppressing facts, which if known or if discovered, would have other facts, which if discovered, would have justified the denial of naturalization.","start":301.739,"stop":327.576,"duration":25.84},{"text":"Now, in the first place, the Court of Appeals didn't claim that that was the situation either.","start":327.576,"stop":334.872,"duration":7.3},{"text":"The Court of Appeals said, in their opinion and it's perfectly clear, and this is at pages 95 and 96 of the record.","start":334.872,"stop":342.199,"duration":7.33},{"text":"The Court of Appeals said the only thing that mattered was that the falsification blocked an investigation and it didn't make any difference, what the investigation would have discovered.","start":342.199,"stop":358.002,"duration":15.8},{"text":"And it didn't make any difference that if the investigation had been held, nevertheless, naturalization might have been granted.","start":358.002,"stop":368.974,"duration":10.97},{"text":"Now, for the reasons I've already gone into, that seems to be clearly wrong.","start":368.974,"stop":377.352,"duration":8.38},{"text":"So, let's come now to a -- to apply the correct test, which is, would the investigation have disclosed a disqualifying factor to the facts.","start":377.352,"stop":389.655,"duration":12.3},{"text":"The only testimony in the record on this subject was offered by the Government's witness, the hearing examiner, the -- for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a man by the name of Derringer, and I quote this testimony in full, beginning at the bottom of page 17 and running on to page 18 of my brief.","start":389.655,"stop":415.831,"duration":26.18},{"text":"And Derringer testified that if a person had an arrest record, an investigation would follow but he testified that the only thing the investigation would do, would be to verify the facts concerning the arrest.","start":415.831,"stop":435.505,"duration":19.67},{"text":"And that's what he said, would be just to check whether or not the listing of arrest, for instance, had been accurate and complete.","start":435.505,"stop":445.642,"duration":10.14},{"text":"So, if you take Derringer's testimony, if the petitioner had disclosed his arrest record or if you take Derringer's testimony, the only thing an investigation would have disclosed is the identicals matter concerning the arrest that we know now and then it's now in the record.","start":445.642,"stop":467.004,"duration":21.36},{"text":"And as I've already said, obviously, those trivia in themselves would have not had justified refusal of naturalization and the court below recognize that they would not have justified refusal of naturalization.","start":467.004,"stop":482.665,"duration":15.66},{"text":"So on Derringer's testimony and that is the only testimony there is in the record, there is nothing to -- Derringer's testimony negatized and there's no other testimony for the contrary, any assumption that an investigation would have discovered any disqualifying fact.","start":482.665,"stop":504.125,"duration":21.46},{"text":"And when you consider that the Government has the burden in a denaturalization case, approving all essential parts of each case by clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence which does not lead the issue in doubt, then it is perfectly clear that if the Government, as I say it had, had the burden of showing that there was a dena -- disqualifying fact in the background, which an investigation would have led to, then the Government has not carried that burden because the only testimony in the record is to the contrary.","start":504.125,"stop":542.664,"duration":38.54},{"text":"Now, the Government, in its brief, now subs -- tries to substitute a complete speculation for proof.","start":542.664,"stop":552.569,"duration":9.9},{"text":"They say that at the time of these arrests, 1929 and 1930, they say that the record shows that at or about that time, the petitioner was a district organizer for the Communist Party in Connecticut.","start":552.569,"stop":571.042,"duration":18.47},{"text":"And they say, well, it seems we -- it seems likely or it can be assumed that if the Service have had the information about the arrest, it would have investigated the arrest and presumably the arrest would might have had something to do with his activities as an official of the Communist Party, and then the Service would have discovered from the arrest that he was therefore a -- had been a district organizer for the Communist Party and this might have led to a denial of naturalization.","start":571.042,"stop":605.004,"duration":33.96},{"text":"Now, there are about four things wrong with that argument.","start":605.004,"stop":609.513,"duration":4.51},{"text":"The first argument is that it is a complete speculation, which can't possibly meet the test for denaturalization, which has been repeatedly announced by the Court.","start":609.513,"stop":622.89,"duration":13.38},{"text":"It not only has no evidence to support it, it is a speculation and direct contradiction to the testimony of Derringer.","start":622.89,"stop":630.488,"duration":7.6},{"text":"In the second place, there is no competent evidence in this record, that at the period of the arrest, the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party or was a district organizer in -- for the Communist Party in Connecticut.","start":630.488,"stop":644.655,"duration":14.17},{"text":"There is incompetent evidence on that subject in the record, consisting of some hearsay testimony by John Lautner, the Government's perennial witness and of some articles in the Daily Worker.","start":644.655,"stop":658.396,"duration":13.74},{"text":"But I don't even -- but I don't think that's the important fact because even if you accepted the hearsay testimony as establishing membership in the Communist Party at this period, nevertheless, there is nothing in record to show that the arrest had anything to do with the Communist Party or that the investigation of the arrest would've led to anything to that sort.","start":658.396,"stop":684.517,"duration":26.12},{"text":"And I may also say that, as a matter of fact, membership in the Communist Party at that time would've been irrelevant anyway for a large number of reasons.","start":684.517,"stop":693.158,"duration":8.64},{"text":"One reason is that it was 10 years before the petition for application and not within the five-year period.","start":693.158,"stop":700.926,"duration":7.77},{"text":"The other reason is, and under the 1906 Act, that Communists were not barred from naturalization nor for that matter were persons belonging to organizations advocating the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.","start":700.926,"stop":715.351,"duration":14.42},{"text":"And Schneiderman, for example, was naturalized under the 1906 Act and this Court held in the Schneiderman case that -- that didn't seem to be anything wrong with that.","start":715.351,"stop":731.411,"duration":16.06},{"text":"Now, in my original brief, I said nothing about or made no argument about the two grounds of denaturalization other than the arrest ground, namely the -- what I've called the \"Communist Party ground\" and what I've called the \"attachment ground.\"","start":731.411,"stop":753.221,"duration":21.81},{"text":"And the reason I didn't argue those two grounds was because the Court of Appeals hadn't discussed them and said that it didn't have to consider them.","start":753.221,"stop":762.969,"duration":9.75},{"text":"And I assume as I said in the footnote in my brief, that under those circumstances, if this Court thought that I was right on either of my -- either of the points that I raised so that the judgment was wrong, so far as the arrests were concerned, that the Court would follow the normal practice of remanding the case to the Court of Appeals to dispose off and decide the remaining issues, namely, the Communist and attachment ground.","start":762.969,"stop":795.398,"duration":32.43},{"text":"In its brief, the Government alleged as an independent ground for sustaining the judgment below, that there had been a misrepresentation as to membership in the Communist Party.","start":795.398,"stop":814.501,"duration":19.1},{"text":"The Government didn't allege what I call the \"third ground\" as an independent ground.","start":814.501,"stop":819.793,"duration":5.29},{"text":"They didn't talk about the \"attachment ground\" but they urged the Court to affirm the judgment below even if the court below is wrong on the arrest, on the grounds that there had been a misrepresentation as the Communist Party membership.","start":819.793,"stop":837.273,"duration":17.48},{"text":"And the assumption in the Government's brief is, that it -- the Court ought to do this even though it's an exception to its usual remand practice because there isn't any factual issue or no real dispute on the facts and it's just the question of law.","start":837.273,"stop":854.373,"duration":17.1},{"text":"So in my reply brief, I took up this question.","start":854.373,"stop":860.141,"duration":5.77},{"text":"Now, as far as I'm concerned, this issue has to be decided and it's up to the Court whether the Court wants to decide it or whether it wants to send it back to the Court of Appeals to decide it.","start":860.141,"stop":870.466,"duration":10.33},{"text":"That is it has to be decided if -- if I am right on either of my first big point.","start":870.466,"stop":875.762,"duration":5.3},{"text":"And I wouldn't presume to tell the Court whether it should decide it or whether it shouldn't waste its time and let the Court of Appeals decide it.","start":875.762,"stop":883.237,"duration":7.48},{"text":"But since the issue was raised in my reply brief, I did analyze the record.","start":883.237,"stop":888.521,"duration":5.28},{"text":"I analyzed the facts and I think I showed that there -- not only is there a factual question but that the only correct resolution of the factual question is that the petitioner did not, did not lie on the subject of Communist Party membership, or that the Government did not prove that there had been any misrepresentation or suppression on that issue.","start":888.521,"stop":917.16,"duration":28.64},{"text":"This depends on -- on rather complicated and involved state of facts.","start":917.16,"stop":924.696,"duration":7.54},{"text":"In addition to that, I went on and said that the subject was not -- was not a material subject within my definition in any event under the 1906 Act.","start":924.696,"stop":936.782,"duration":12.09},{"text":"Now, for present purposes, since I don't know whether the Government still adheres for its position, that there basically is no factual dispute.","start":936.782,"stop":946.814,"duration":10.03},{"text":"I would like to, unless the Court appeals otherwise, reserve any possible discussion on the suppression as to or alleged suppression as to Communist Party membership until after the Government's argument.","start":946.814,"stop":961.478,"duration":14.66},{"text":"And for that reason, I will reserve the remainder of my time.","start":961.478,"stop":964.518,"duration":3.04}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"You may.","start":964.518,"stop":964.747,"duration":0.23}]},{"speakerName":"Joseph
