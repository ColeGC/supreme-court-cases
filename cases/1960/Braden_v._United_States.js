say at the beginning, that while the Government's brief in opposing certiorari states on page 2, we think is the fact that the actual subject matter of these hearings was, \"Communist infiltration of Southern industry.\"","start":156.988,"stop":174.553,"duration":17.56},{"text":"I emphasize that word because there is no suggestion that Mr. Braden ever had any connection with the textile or other

delivered but certainly bearing the date of July 22, 1958 to the members of Congress and signed by 200 Negro leaders in the South, asking the Congress not to commit the House Committee to carryout its contended visit to Atlanta, Georgia, on the theory that the Committee would -- that there would be a confusion between Un-American Activities and what went out, it were regarded by many people in the South with Un-American Activities, namely, furthering racial integration.","start":220.456,"stop":264.389,"duration":43.93},{"text":"That was July 22, which happens to be the date of the subpoena that

seditious.","start":273.332,"stop":295.965,"duration":22.63},{"text":"It appears on 107 and 108 of the record and also at page 116 of the record and that is a letter which Mr. Braden and his wife, on the letterhead of this -- of the Southern Conference Educational Fund, wrote to the public, to their fellow citizens asking them to oppose three bills then pending in Congress, which would have had the effect of overturning the decision of this Court in Pennsylvania against Nelson.","start":295.965,"stop":329.189,"duration":33.22},{"text":"That by the way is the very letter which is the subject of Count 5, of the indictment.","start":329.189,"stop":339.144,"duration":9.95},{"text":"Mr. Braden appeared at the congressional committee hearing on the second day in Atlanta.","start":339.144,"stop":346.248,"duration":7.1},{"text":"He had been served incidentally, while vacationing at the seashore home of Mr. Harvey O'Connor, the Chairman of the Emergency Civil

be made.","start":346.248,"stop":367.338,"duration":21.09},{"text":"Mr. O'Connor is a well-known biographer of industrial leaders principally and headed by then, Mr. Braden and its entire family to

counts referred to the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.","start":387.428,"stop":394.13,"duration":6.7},{"text":"When Mr. Braden appeared on the second day, he was interrogated by Mr. Arens, the counsel to the House of Un-American Activities Committee, on this subject of the letter which had been sent by the Negro leaders.","start":394.13,"stop":413.172,"duration":19.04},{"text":"The interrogation appears at 97 of the record and includes an attack upon a Negro leaders by Congressman Jackson, who first charged to that point that they were, were practically Communists and later on, at the end of the record, after some further thought, said, perhaps they were only dukes and gave them a chance to exculpate themselves by writing to the Committee and saying that they really didn't know what they were doing, Your Honors can see that.","start":413.172,"stop":438.976,"duration":25.8},{"text":"Then Mr. Arens proceeded to examine Mr. Braden with respect to the matters which are set forth in the indictment because the item with respect to the Negro leaders is not up here in the indictment, although Mr. Braden refused to answer that, as well as the other questions.","start":438.976,"stop":455.615,"duration":16.64},{"text":"Before I come to the question, let me say, that the refusal to answer these six questions set forth in the indictment was based explicitly upon the First Amendment and explicitly, upon this Court's decision in Watkins and in Sweezy and other cases, that the issue of pertinency was raised by Mr. Braden explicitly, a lack of legislative purpose, the vagueness of the Committee's mandate, all of the textures that could be raised, were raised at that point.","start":455.615,"stop":485.625,"duration":30.01},{"text":"Your Honors will recall that this occurred after the Watkins decision in 1957 and before the Barenblatt decision was therefore, no occasion from Mr. -- from Mr. Braden to mention Barenblatt would it take that into consideration.","start":485.625,"stop":501.721,"duration":16.1},{"text":"Now, Mr. Arens in the course of the extended colloquy which appears between 89 and 110 of the record, charged Mr. Braden with respect to this letter which is referred to in Count 5, a stimulating political pressure against security as if a letter to ones fellow citizens, which is reproduced in the record, should be subject to criticism and also said that he thought that they wanted information concerning the Southern Conference Educational Fund because they might want to cite, C.I.T.E that organization as a Communist front or a subversive organization as they referred to the Committee.","start":501.721,"stop":546.529,"duration":44.81},{"text":"Now, I come down to the counts in the indictment.","start":546.529,"stop":551.828,"duration":5.3},{"text":"The first counts, 1 and 2, appearing on page 3, \"Did you participate in a meeting here at that time and who solicited the quarters

headed by its officers at the American Red Cross building in Atlanta, Georgia?\"","start":551.828,"stop":581.491,"duration":29.66},{"text":"And while the record seems to indicate that Mr. Braden did participate from further cross-examination of him, he declined to answer these two questions for the reasons stated.","start":581.491,"stop":591.965,"duration":10.47},{"text":"The next two questions \"Are you connected with the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee and did you and Harvey O'Connor in the course of your conference there in Rhode Island, developed plans and strategies, somewhat frightening phrase, outlining work schedules for the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee?\"","start":591.965,"stop":613.209,"duration":21.24},{"text":"I suspect and there's nothing in the record to indicate any connection between Mr. Braden and the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, except as being the guest of a more well-to-do host, who happened to have a seashore home, I suspect that if the marshal had not found Mr. Braden at the home of Mr. O'Connor, these questions were never have been asked, but there is no connection between Mr. Braden and Mr. O'Connor or the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.","start":613.209,"stop":640.401,"duration":27.19},{"text":"I came to the last question first because I want to come to -- except, being the most interesting.","start":640.401,"stop":645.671,"duration":5.27},{"text":"I would just like to ask you whether or not, you being a resident of Louisville, Kentucky, had anything to do there with the Southern Newsletter?","start":645.671,"stop":654.666,"duration":9},{"text":"Now, oddly enough, there is nothing in this record, even the hearing which Mr. Braden appeared or in a trial to indicate what the -- the Southern Newsletter is.","start":654.666,"stop":665.187,"duration":10.52},{"text":"Other witnesses testified generally on the subject and it appears to be a periodical devoted furthering the cause integration.","start":665.187,"stop":673.477,"duration":8.29},{"text":"Although Mr. Braden is not the editor of that but of another paper, which he refers to in the record and all that Mr. Arens could say on the trial is that he thinks that the Southern Newsletter sort of -- some sort of a pamphlet that you fold up.","start":673.477,"stop":689.207,"duration":15.73},{"text":"This is all the content with respect to this putatively seditious document.","start":689.207,"stop":695.512,"duration":6.3},{"text":"I should add also that at the course of the hearings at which Mr. Braden appeared on July 30th, and on the course of the trial, there was not a single word of testimony.","start":695.512,"stop":705.66,"duration":10.15},{"text":"I mean testimony, I'm not talking about hearsay or opinions as Mr. Arens gave a great deal of that and it was characterized by the court which accepted it as merely hearsay and is not proof of facts.","start":705.66,"stop":717.506,"duration":11.85},{"text":"There is no -- no evidence in this record at all that the Southern Conference or the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee or the Southern Newsletter are Communist organizations or periodical in the last case or that Mr. O'Connor or that Mr. Braden is or was, a member of the Communist Party.","start":717.506,"stop":737.915,"duration":20.41},{"text":"I'm not suggesting now that I would have a different view as to the rights of Mr. Braden, bad in such evidence.","start":737.915,"stop":744.835,"duration":6.92},{"text":"I don't have to meet that issue in this case.","start":744.835,"stop":749.789,"duration":4.95},{"text":"Then came a trial, first it was a citation, there was in indictment and a trial.","start":749.789,"stop":755.634,"duration":5.85},{"text":"Then at the trial, Mr. Arens testified again.","start":755.634,"stop":759.052,"duration":3.42},{"text":"I mentioned before that he stated it was the Committee's understanding that these people were Communists.","start":759.052,"stop":764.202,"duration":5.15},{"text":"It was the Committee's information that they were, in those special cases and he repeated his interest in citing Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.","start":764.202,"stop":775.032,"duration":10.83},{"text":"He described the petition of the Negro ministers as an attempt to preclude, I'm referring now to page 29 of the record, preclude committee and soften committee hearings as no one appealed to the statement of the House and the members House, was again subject to criticism and referred to generally, on page 29 of the record, and this is Count 5 of course, at least one of the letters -- one of the letters, with a letter signed by Mr. Braden and another person, his wife, I say, urging congressional action of some kind.","start":775.032,"stop":810.734,"duration":35.7},{"text":"And of course, this was a subject of count 5, which says, \"Were you a member of the Communist Party,\" the instant, Your Honors aren't here to hear the dramatic inflection of the question, the instant that you affixed your signature to that letter.","start":810.734,"stop":827.267,"duration":16.53},{"text":"This was not a -- a general inquiry of the Communist Party, the inquiry had been contained in the letter and the effort was made to criticize the writing of a letter or to undercut its appeal at -- on the theory that perhaps, Mr. Braden at that instant, which is also that the (Inaudible) are concerned about that are members of the Communist Party.","start":827.267,"stop":845.957,"duration":18.69},{"text":"Now, we come down to our argument.","start":845.957,"stop":850.612,"duration":4.65},{"text":"First, while taking the position as we have in the briefs that we do not -- or as differentially concur in this Court's decision of the Barenblatt case.","start":850.612,"stop":864.002,"duration":13.39},{"text":"We do not feel that that issue has to be met in this case, because neither the rationale of Barenblatt nor the facts in that case, are the same as the rationale which we think, controls this case and the facts in this case.","start":864.002,"stop":879.313,"duration":15.31},{"text":"Let me state in a few lines that why we feel that to be the case.","start":879.313,"stop":884.505,"duration":5.19},{"text":"In Barenblatt, this Court held that an inquiry into Barenblatt's membership better known into the Communist Party -- in a Communist Party, could be made notwithstanding what was recognized in the majority opinion, of course, in the other opinion, as an intrusion into the First Amendment area.","start":884.505,"stop":906.003,"duration":21.5},{"text":"The theory -- theory on which the right to ask was held to outweigh the right to refuse, was the theory of what it called self-defense of the Government, citing or paraphrasing Dennis, namely the right of the Government to investigate violent overthrow of the Government.","start":906.003,"stop":930.511,"duration":24.51},{"text":"Now, the Court held that that Communist Party was by its tenants, so aligned to the doctrine of the overthrow the Government that it was proper to substitute the words Communist Party for the words, those who want to overthrow the Government.","start":930.511,"stop":948.561,"duration":18.05},{"text":"And therefore, that this intrusion was permissible.","start":948.561,"stop":954.292,"duration":5.73},{"text":"Now, of course, this Court recognized in Barenblatt not only by its devotion, its analysis of the Communist Party, but by the questions which it did not decide, which Your Honors will recall, namely, other peoples membership in the Communist Party and finally Barenblatt's connection with the art sciences and professions group, recognized that it was dealing with a group which it regarded and as sui generic a special dangerous group and in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion in -- in Sweezy, this point is made that there is a special status to the Communist Party -- of the Communist Party.","start":954.292,"stop":998.155,"duration":43.86},{"text":"The Court in making its decision in Barenblatt, relied upon a combination of I think what we can call, judicial notice based upon prior trials of Dennis etcetera and based upon the variety of legislation in which Congress perhaps, violating the principles against the (Inaudible) perhaps not has made findings with respect to the Communist Party.","start":998.155,"stop":1024.576,"duration":26.42},{"text":"Now, in the present case as I've indicated, we are not dealing with the Communist Party.","start":1024.576,"stop":1030.656,"duration":6.08},{"text":"He only mentioned that the Communist Party is in count 5, which I think for the reason which I will indicate, as a weakest count for the Government.","start":1030.656,"stop":1038.046,"duration":7.39},{"text":"I'm rather pleased that the Government thinks, is the strongest count here.","start":1038.046,"stop":1042.884,"duration":4.84},{"text":"All of these others deal with organizations, which so far as this record is concerned, have been devoting themselves to good causes.","start":1042.884,"stop":1054.557,"duration":11.67},{"text":"And they say the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, a sponsor to at least three cases in this Court, I think that its principal function (Inaudible) against Casey (Inaudible) and Abramowitz against Brucker and no one could suggest dysfunctioning of those cases, bought it within the ambit of Barenblatt.","start":1054.557,"stop":1072.069,"duration":17.51},{"text":"Now, I say again that there was not a word in the record of a single witness, there was a testimony by the way in Barenblatt on this subject, a single witness that these people were members of the Communist Party, or that the organizations were subversive organizations of any kind.","start":1072.069,"stop":1090.332,"duration":18.26},{"text":"And we say that we do not here, have what was called in Sweezy, compelling reasons, what was called in Kelly the same, what was called in Bates cogent reasons, what was called in N.A.A.C.P. against Alabama controlling the substantial reasons for overriding what are recognized to be First Amendment rights that we were dealing in some of these cases with -- with the recognition that Communist Party within the area of the First Amendment right to be overrule, surely, that will apply here in the organizations that I am discussing.","start":1090.332,"stop":1129.802,"duration":39.47},{"text":"Now, I turn specifically to count 5 because there we regard, it has the most dangerous argument that can be made by a Government because count 5 involves an appeal for one's fellow citizen to protest against pending legislation.","start":1129.802,"stop":1149.156,"duration":19.35},{"text":"Well, this is a very far cry, it hardly needs to be argued, very far cry from the violent overthrow the Government that in one of the earliest cases as Second Circuit indicated referring to the judgment can take of course was within the permissible ambit of this vague or what we thought was vague language in House Resolution 5 and its predecessors.","start":1149.156,"stop":1172.941,"duration":23.79},{"text":"It's certainly

affirmatively, the meaning of the right of petition, a right which I think really is antecedent to the right of freedom of speech in the Anglo-Saxon world, a right which appears in Magna Carta in the
