matter of fact -- in -- arising from our proceeding, I think there were probably five or six cases now in four years.","start":1450.06,"stop":1461.123,"duration":11.06},{"text":"One lawyer was acquitted and later disbarred and disciplinary though.","start":1461.123,"stop":1466.85,"duration":5.73},{"text":"Two lawyers got six months in jail.","start":1466.85,"stop":1469.993,"duration":3.14},{"text":"They pleaded to a misdemeanor and others pleaded guilty to felonies and consented to disbarment.","start":1469.993,"stop":1478.947,"duration":8.95},{"text":"So six were dispose up today in four years in that way.","start":1478.947,"stop":1483.038,"duration":4.09},{"text":"So that, you see, the great majority of the cases involved are something other than crimes.","start":1483.038,"stop":1489.765,"duration":6.73},{"text":"And that, of course, we have the -- the problem of -- of whether -- in the -- in the criminal courts of having to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt whereas we have the -- the weight of evidence, the preponderance of the evidence in the disciplinary proceeding.","start":1489.765,"stop":1507.697,"duration":17.93},{"text":"I should like to point out and I think this is important here is -- whether in some of these other cases that this case, as I conceive it, points up too sharply conflicting views of the role of the lawyer in American society.","start":1507.697,"stop":1528.057,"duration":20.36},{"text":"And I think the real question that's presented in this case involves the true status of the American lawyer or if you -- if one would prefer more modern current Madison Avenue style, the true image that should be projected of the lawyer, by the courts and by the bar, not the lawyer of fiction or TV or movies or the comics but the -- the real honest to goodness image as lawyers and -- and judges know he should be.","start":1528.057,"stop":1566.186,"duration":38.13},{"text":"In other words, is he just a plain American citizen with no more obligations or no additional burdens or responsibilities, and the ordinary citizen?","start":1566.186,"stop":1575.628,"duration":9.44},{"text":"Is he only as he's claimed here by the opposition only a bear licensee of the State or is he something more?","start":1575.628,"stop":1584.702,"duration":9.07},{"text":"Now, I think this Court and the courts of New York have indicated more and more that the true role of the lawyer is more in the nature of a trustee.","start":1584.702,"stop":1598.424,"duration":13.72},{"text":"And I think if that's considered for a few moments, you'll see how -- how that works out with every element as I -- as I conceive it of -- of a trust involved here.","start":1598.424,"stop":1612.436,"duration":14.01},{"text":"And it seems to be the judgment of the -- of the courts of New York that when a lawyer, as I said before, is called to the witness stand, he comes there in two distinct capacities.","start":1612.436,"stop":1622.72,"duration":10.28},{"text":"First, as a citizen, with all the rights and privileges and duties of a citizen, but beyond that, he appears as a lawyer with all of the rights and privileges of the lawyer and also all of the stern duties and solemn responsibilities of his lawyerhood.","start":1622.72,"stop":1640.034,"duration":17.31},{"text":"So that we think he's -- and the courts of -- of New York have said and this Court has repeatedly emphasized in -- in various opinions involving lawyers that he's more than a -- a mere licensee and more it came through a trustee.","start":1640.034,"stop":1657.077,"duration":17.04},{"text":"So that we -- we work that out in this way.","start":1657.077,"stop":1660.053,"duration":2.98},{"text":"That when a lawyer is admitted to the bar.","start":1660.053,"stop":1663.563,"duration":3.51},{"text":"He presents himself for admission and he is admitted to the bar, the effect seems to be that the court, the admitting court is representing to society at large that here is an honorable man worthy of the public's trust and confidence, worthy to uphold the honor of the profession and as its officer, the dignity of the court.","start":1663.563,"stop":1686.646,"duration":23.08},{"text":"So that when a lawyer takes the oath, as happened here this morning, takes the oath, whether in this Court or any other court in the land, he is held out and certified by the admitting court as a person in whom the Court places its special confidence and in whom the public may trust.","start":1686.646,"stop":1707.319,"duration":20.67},{"text":"That certainly consistent with what Chief Justice Hughes said some years ago that the practice of the profession of the law is the privilege administration of a public trust.","start":1707.319,"stop":1719.328,"duration":12.01},{"text":"And I think it's upon the basis of that -- of that certification, that representation by the Court that in every specific case that the lawyer handles, his clients confined the most precious causes to him.","start":1719.328,"stop":1736.086,"duration":16.76},{"text":"They trust in him even though they never met the lawyer before and they put in his hands because they trust him on the representation by the Court and holding out by the Court, they entrust him with the defense of their properties and their liberties and their lives.","start":1736.086,"stop":1753.331,"duration":17.24},{"text":"And in a broader sense, may I suggest to this Court, in a broader, in a more general sense, as I conceive it, every lawyer is also a trustee of the vast rich heritage of the common law, of all of our statutory law and of all that the law stands for.","start":1753.331,"stop":1774.646,"duration":21.32},{"text":"So that I submit that upon admission, a lawyer in reality becomes a trustee of the law and the Court appoints him as such.","start":1774.646,"stop":1786.682,"duration":12.04},{"text":"You have a trust grieves.","start":1786.682,"stop":1790.012,"duration":3.33},{"text":"You have the great body of the law that was so eloquently described by Justice Holmes.","start":1790.012,"stop":1796.374,"duration":6.36},{"text":"You have the public as the beneficiary.","start":1796.374,"stop":1800.12,"duration":3.75},{"text":"You have the Court as the creator or the secular of the trust.","start":1800.12,"stop":1805.322,"duration":5.2},{"text":"Now, you have a lawyer as the trustee and he's called in by the very court that admitted him and it has the power to discipline him.","start":1805.322,"stop":1812.796,"duration":7.47},{"text":"He's called in to give an accounting of his stewardship.","start":1812.796,"stop":1816.809,"duration":4.01},{"text":"He may refuse to answer, that we conceive.","start":1816.809,"stop":1820.275,"duration":3.47},{"text":"He may invoke his privilege and his plea must be sustained if he invokes his constitutional privilege.","start":1820.275,"stop":1828.474,"duration":8.2},{"text":"But the courts of New York said, in failing to account, for his failure to account, he forfeits his trusteeship in the bar.","start":1828.474,"stop":1837.582,"duration":9.11},{"text":"And in this case, the Court's decree that petitioner by failing to account for his professional conduct could be stood no longer.","start":1837.582,"stop":1847.483,"duration":9.9},{"text":"Now, carrying the analogy further, where a court ousts a trustee for refusal to render his account, he comes in, he's told to render his account, whether he is a testamentary trustee or whether he is a trustee of a living trust and he refuses to account under a claim of constitutional privilege, I submit, that a claim of depravation of due process has no validity in such circumstances.","start":1847.483,"stop":1878.089,"duration":30.61},{"text":"Certainly to prevent his removal, the trustee cannot insist that the beneficiaries must -- as this claimed here, must in the first instance prove an affirmative case against him of wrongdoing against the trustee before he must come forward with his account.","start":1878.089,"stop":1895.123,"duration":17.03},{"text":"And the right to specific charges and prove to confronta -- confrontation on cross-examination of witnesses, I submit, is beside the point where there is an absolute duty in the first instance of coming forward with the true account.","start":1895.123,"stop":1910.163,"duration":15.04},{"text":"I gather my time is up.","start":1910.163,"stop":1913.554,"duration":3.39}]}]}],"decidedBy":"Warren Court","arguedOn":"Dec  14 - 15,
