evidence were of course quite different but in the large, the case is not unlike the Ben Gold case.","start":268.283,"stop":275.531,"duration":7.25},{"text":"It's not unlike it in this sense that the petitioner here, like Gold, was an open and avowed member of the Communist Party and openly avowed his membership prior to the passage of the Taft–Hartley Law.","start":275.531,"stop":288.418,"duration":12.89},{"text":"And again, like Gold, the Taft–Hartley launched at the fact and couple years thereafter, the petitioner issued a public statement in which he said that he was resigning, that he had resigned from the Communist Party for the specific purpose of enabling him to maintain his status as a union officer so that he could then file an non-Communist affidavit and his union would have compliance state as under National Labor Relations Board.","start":288.418,"stop":318.488,"duration":30.07},{"text":"And after having made that public statement that he was resigning from the Communist Party, he did sign non-Communist affidavits.","start":318.488,"stop":326.871,"duration":8.38},{"text":"They were filed to the National Labor Relations Board and the compliance status was obtained.","start":326.871,"stop":332.358,"duration":5.49},{"text":"And therefore, the ultimate question for the jury here was whether despite that statement of public -- that public statement of resignation, the petitioner had maintained a clandestine relation or connection with Communist Party amounting to membership or affiliation.","start":332.358,"stop":352.193,"duration":19.83},{"text":"I should say too that the petitioner here had been an employee of this union, the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers for a number of years and he became secretary of treasurer in 1948 and that was the office he occupied at the time he signed these affidavits though he no longer does.","start":352.193,"stop":370.797,"duration":18.6},{"text":"The headquarters of this union which is the principal union dealing with nonferrous metals, headquarters is in Denver and the petitioner's statement of resignation from the Communist Party, which is in exhibit in the record here, I'll refer to it later on, was issued in August, 1949 about two years after the Taft–Hartley Law took effect.","start":370.797,"stop":394.109,"duration":23.31},{"text":"As I've already mentioned that the provision of the Taft–Hartley law requires these affidavits, and it's set forth in the appendix to our brief.","start":394.109,"stop":405.352,"duration":11.24},{"text":"What the affidavit must cover is a specific denial of Communist Party membership, a denial of affiliation, and a further denial that the -- that the defiant is not a member of and he does not support any organization that believes and/or teaches the overthrow of Governments.","start":405.352,"stop":427.612,"duration":22.26},{"text":"The two affidavits on which the indictment is based here were filed respectively in December, 1951 and December, 1952.","start":427.612,"stop":436.666,"duration":9.05},{"text":"And these affidavits were executed by the defiant in Denver.","start":436.666,"stop":442.152,"duration":5.49},{"text":"They were then combined with the other -- the affidavits of the other union officers and were sent under cover of a letter from the union presidents to the National Labor Relations Board in Washington where they were received and filed in the offices here, a word about the indictment which recurs on the first four pages of the big record.","start":442.152,"stop":465.667,"duration":23.51},{"text":"The Court will see that it originally contains six counts.","start":465.667,"stop":470.612,"duration":4.95},{"text":"The first three counts were based on the 1951 affidavit.","start":470.612,"stop":474.436,"duration":3.82},{"text":"The second three counts were based on the 1952 affidavit.","start":474.436,"stop":478.612,"duration":4.18},{"text":"The first count charged a false statement as to the membership.","start":478.612,"stop":483.264,"duration":4.65},{"text":"The second count, a false statement as to the affiliation and the third count charged that he in fact kind of supported an organization that talk about overthrow.","start":483.264,"stop":496.017,"duration":12.75},{"text":"And counts four and five and six were the same, except they related to the second affidavit in 1952.","start":496.017,"stop":501.673,"duration":5.66},{"text":"Now, we only have left in the case count one, two, four and five because one -- one, two -- yes, that's right.","start":501.673,"stop":508.38,"duration":6.71},{"text":"Because counts three and six which are the support counts were dismissed by the Government before a trial and so they played no part in the proceedings.","start":508.38,"stop":519.094,"duration":10.71},{"text":"The petitioner was nonetheless convicted on these four counts that remained.","start":519.094,"stop":523.346,"duration":4.25},{"text":"The two counts on membership and affiliation relating to the 1951 affidavit and the two on membership and affiliation relating to the 1952 affidavit, and he got four years on each count but the membership and affiliation, counts one and two on the 1951 affidavit ran concurrently and the two counts on the 1952 affidavit where it began after that, so he's got eight years to serve in all in the sentences on the counts and then he was also fined on the membership counts but not on the affiliation counts.","start":523.346,"stop":557.774,"duration":34.43},{"text":"Now, as I have said all but one of the issues pertaining to proceedings in the trial court.","start":557.774,"stop":565.161,"duration":7.39},{"text":"Let me just mention in advance or we're coming back to them, two of these issues that are maybe especially important.","start":565.161,"stop":572.263,"duration":7.1},{"text":"One of them is the question of access to grand jury minutes and the questions there grow out of questions dealt within the Pittsburgh Plate Glass case.","start":572.263,"stop":582.806,"duration":10.54},{"text":"And another question is whether the special rules on pardon of proof in perjury cases should be applied -- should or should not be applied here, the so called \"two witness rule.\"","start":582.806,"stop":595.505,"duration":12.7},{"text":"This has not been a technical perjury case but nonetheless involving a false statement.","start":595.505,"stop":599.755,"duration":4.25},{"text":"The issue was whether those rules peculiar to perjury should be applied here.","start":599.755,"stop":604.767,"duration":5.01},{"text":"That question was before the Court when the Gold case came up and was briefed and fully argued when the Gold case was here, although the Court didn't pass on it because they sent it back, here they reversed that case on other grounds.","start":604.767,"stop":618.574,"duration":13.81},{"text":"Now, these two points relating to the grand jury minutes and perjury rule are the two matters on which Judge Murrah dissented below.","start":618.574,"stop":628.357,"duration":9.78},{"text":"There are several other questions pertaining to the trial, couple of them growing out of the Jencks statute and then there are of course these questions, count with the -- the question of the denial of the motion for a new trial in cases 3 and 71.","start":628.357,"stop":641.988,"duration":13.63},{"text":"I'll be coming back to those but I want to deal first with the question of venue and I want to deal with it first of course because if we are right in our position that there was no jurisdiction in Colorado and the proper -- the only proper venue is here in Washington, then of course, the indictment has to be dismissed and all these other questions pertaining to the trial will fall away because that will -- that would require a dismissal of the entire indictment.","start":641.988,"stop":671.024,"duration":29.04},{"text":"Now, our challenge to the venue is based on the fact that the petitioner was tried not in the District of Columbia where these affidavits were filed as they had to be, but in Denver, where the union had its headquarters and from where these affidavits were mailed.","start":671.024,"stop":690.143,"duration":19.12},{"text":"And other things should be explained at this point and that is that under the Board's regulations, officers of local unions are required to file their affidavits at the regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, the nearby regional offices or wherever the nearest one may be, whereas officers of national unions or as they're more often called international unions.","start":690.143,"stop":713.945,"duration":23.8},{"text":"They are required to file affidavits at the main offices of the Labor Board here in Washington.","start":713.945,"stop":722.332,"duration":8.39},{"text":"Now, in Government's general practice, in bringing proceedings against people who're accused for falling -- filing false affidavits, has been to bring the indictment where the affidavit was filed, not from where it was mailed.","start":722.332,"stop":738.861,"duration":16.53},{"text":"The Gold case itself came up from the District of Columbia here where the affidavit was filed, though Gold had made and mailed the affidavit from New York.","start":738.861,"stop":748.856,"duration":10},{"text":"The Jencks case, Jencks was tried in the Western District of Texas where the regional office of the Board is at El Paso and not in New Mexico where he had been an officer of the local union and where he had made and from where the affidavit had been mailed.","start":748.856,"stop":765.239,"duration":16.38},{"text":"And the same is true of all the other cases except one and this one that the -- that the indictment has been brought at the place of the filing, not at the place of mailing.","start":765.239,"stop":778.182,"duration":12.94},{"text":"In the present case, the Government has sought to establish venue in Denver on the basis of the mailing.","start":778.182,"stop":784.793,"duration":6.61},{"text":"The petitioner, then the defendant, made timely challenge to venue, there's no question about that, on this very ground.","start":784.793,"stop":793.339,"duration":8.55},{"text":"The District Court upheld venue in Colorado and the Court of Appeals affirmed that.","start":793.339,"stop":800.708,"duration":7.37},{"text":"Now, that decision on the venue is on the appeal from the first conviction, not the second.","start":800.708,"stop":805.795,"duration":5.09},{"text":"And therefore, you won't find any mention of venue in the Court of Appeals opinion from which we are now coming.","start":805.795,"stop":812.519,"duration":6.72},{"text":"And for some reason, that first opinion of the Court of Appeals is not in the records but it is in the appendix to our petition for certiorari and of course it is reported in the federal court.","start":812.519,"stop":825.5,"duration":12.98},{"text":"And the decision below sustaining the venue in Colorado is one of two Court of Appeals decisions dealing with this.","start":825.5,"stop":834.024,"duration":8.52},{"text":"The other case is the -- one other case where the defendant was indicted at the place of mailing and that is the Valenti case, which went to the Third Circuit.","start":834.024,"stop":843.137,"duration":9.11},{"text":"And the Court appeals for the Third Circuit in the Valenti case held that there was venue only at the place of filing and therefore, sent the case back to be dismissed on the ground that the venue was improper.","start":843.137,"stop":857.241,"duration":14.1},{"text":"I should add that Judge Hastie, in the Valenti case, wrote a concurrent opinion.","start":857.241,"stop":862.317,"duration":5.08},{"text":"He concurred because the proof of mailing was insufficient, but he expressed views in his concurrent opinion which are more like the views expressed in this case below, whereas Judges Biggs and Maris held that venue would lie only where the affidavit is filed.","start":862.317,"stop":880.898,"duration":18.58},{"text":"Now, our position is that the Valenti case was rightly decided and the decision below is wrong and that there's venue only here in Washington.","start":880.898,"stop":889.85,"duration":8.95},{"text":"And I think in addressing myself to this issue, it would be helpful if I state first that part of the analysis on which there is no dispute between the petitioner and the Government, and then come to the point at which we part ways.","start":889.85,"stop":904.746,"duration":14.9},{"text":"And may I now therefore invite the Court's attention to the statutes that are directly involved here which are in the appendix to our brief, pages 1 (a) and 2 (a).","start":904.746,"stop":918.526,"duration":13.78},{"text":"The third paragraph of that appendix sets forth 9 (h), and the Court will see that the statute specifically says that the union can't use the facilities of the Board unless there is an affidavit on file, unless there is on file with the Board, an affidavit.","start":918.526,"stop":937.292,"duration":18.77},{"text":"That's in the third line on the top of page 2 (a).","start":937.292,"stop":940.509,"duration":3.22},{"text":"So the requirement is expressly placed on the filing then.","start":940.509,"stop":943.71,"duration":3.2},{"text":"Now then, the penalty is contained in the last sentence further down there.","start":943.71,"stop":948.124,"duration":4.41},{"text":"The provisions of Section 35 (a) of the Criminal Code shall be applicable in respect to such affidavits, meaning clearly affidavits which are on file with the Board.","start":948.124,"stop":958.917,"duration":10.79},{"text":"Now, 35 (a) of the Criminal Code has been since broken down into a number of different Code provisions but the one that's involved here is set forth on page 1 (a) just back of the page, 18 U.S. Code 101, that's the well known false statements statute which makes it an offense to make or use a false statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of any government agency.","start":958.917,"stop":984.68,"duration":25.76}]},{"speakerName":"John M.

conversations which are about the only contemporaneous evidence that indicates -- it could be taken indicate continued membership on the petitioner's part, and one of those conversations is described

across the border, because of his connection with the Communist Party and his public resignation and so forth.","start":81.815,"stop":95.721,"duration":13.91},{"text":"Then page 444 there, Gardner says that he asked Travis if the -- other unions are having the same difficulties and here is where the crucial part.","start":95.721,"stop":105.268,"duration":9.55},{"text":"He said, no, the Canadian

that.","start":112.399,"stop":126.748,"duration":14.35},{"text":"And pointing out that it wasn't a true resignation from the party, but actually it was done to conform to the Taft-Harley

here.","start":209.61,"stop":217.036,"duration":7.43},{"text":"And why this is therefore, a particularly important instance where access to the grand jury minutes would have been valuable.","start":217.036,"stop":225.17,"duration":8.13},{"text":"Now interestingly enough, this same witness Gardner has testified about this conversation in a later proceeding before the SACB, which we quoted in our brief of page 35, and there he puts it quite differently.","start":225.17,"stop":243.703,"duration":18.53},{"text":"He says there that he was quite convinced, that is Travis, that neither the American nor the Canadian authorities believed his resignation was genuine.","start":243.703,"stop":252.856,"duration":9.15},{"text":"And as a result, he had this difficulty in

not much news.","start":256.5,"stop":263.537,"duration":7.04},{"text":"The fact that this prosecution was brought in the case that the Government didn't think his resignation was genuine and as you

brief.","start":263.537,"stop":279.805,"duration":16.27},{"text":"So as I say, I brought out the details about this conversation, because it seems to me that if there ever were circumstances where access to the minutes of the grand jury would have been useful to compare what he said about this episode there to what he said before the jury.","start":279.805,"stop":295.993,"duration":16.19},{"text":"This is such an illustration.","start":295.993,"stop":298.109,"duration":2.12},{"text":"Now, I think there can be no defense of the way

Pittsburgh Plate Glass that you do not have to have a preliminary showing of inconsistency.","start":306.404,"stop":315.682,"duration":9.28},{"text":"The trial judge said that in his opinion, even a possible inconsistency was not enough that it had to be an inconsistency going to the basis of the case.","start":315.682,"stop":328.427,"duration":12.75},{"text":"Then, when the petitioner's counsel tried to particularize further the possible need for this testimony and endeavored to question the witnesses about what they had talked about before the grand jury and whether they had described these conversations, the trial judge cut him off and would not allow that line of testimony -- of questioning to be pursued, so that there he was very much hampered in efforts to show by examining the witnesses that there might be need for access to the testimony.","start":328.427,"stop":359.75,"duration":31.32},{"text":"And then finally, both the trial court and the prosecution simply took a blanket position of opposition to any and every request for any grand jury testimony, no matter how limited.","start":359.75,"stop":372.253,"duration":12.5},{"text":"As I read the Government's brief, it doesn't seem to me that they have made any very serious effort to defend these rulings in this trial.","start":372.253,"stop":382.089,"duration":9.84},{"text":"The main burden of their brief on this point is that if it should be ruled that there was an abusive discussion here and a reversal on that ground, they ask that this Court not lay down any absolute rule, any rule of absolute right to access to minutes.","start":382.089,"stop":399.969,"duration":17.88},{"text":"Well, what they call, they don't want to rule an automatic

no sound reason why the minutes should not be examined.","start":426.381,"stop":453.434,"duration":27.05},{"text":"And as I said earlier, in the Second Circuit, there is a whole line of decisions that
