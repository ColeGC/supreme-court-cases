heat.","start":165.921,"stop":180.598,"duration":14.68},{"text":"And the function of this reactor is to capture that energy in the form of heat, turn it into steam and then use the steam to generate

escape.","start":207.287,"stop":230.09,"duration":22.8},{"text":"The third consequence of a fission is the release of free neutrons.","start":230.09,"stop":235.862,"duration":5.77},{"text":"Now, if you had 100 fissions, to take a small number, actually, we're dealing with billions, if you had 100 fissions and then they release just enough free neutrons to cause another 100 fissions as they struck atoms of U-235, obviously, you'd have a self-sustaining chain reaction.","start":235.862,"stop":256.463,"duration":20.6},{"text":"If you had only 95 out of 100 in each generation, cause another

free neutrons in such a way that he can raise the level up to the level at which he wants it to operate and then hold it there, operating it just each generation of neutrons reproducing itself or to

neutrons.","start":316.673,"stop":322.967,"duration":6.29},{"text":"The various ways of doing that, one, is obviously to increase the number of U-235 atoms in your fuel because if you have more U-235 atoms, the chance that a free neutron will strike one in such a way to cause fission increases.","start":322.967,"stop":340.462,"duration":17.5},{"text":"Equally, if you increase the amount of fuel,

the large-scale power reactors are what are known as thermal reactors because they depend for the reaction on slow neutrons, which I'll describe in a minute, rather than the fast neutrons on which the PRDC reactor were built, it will depend.","start":460.215,"stop":483.049,"duration":22.83},{"text":"One of the characteristics of an atom of U-235 is that for some reason, it splits more easily when it's hit by a neutron going slowly than when it's hit by a neutron going fast.","start":483.049,"stop":497.543,"duration":14.49},{"text":"So what scientist does is to put into the reactor in and around the fuel something called a moderator that will slow the neutron down without capturing it and thereby increase the number of fissions that takes place for a given number of free neutrons.","start":497.543,"stop":514.657,"duration":17.11},{"text":"And those are called thermal reactors.","start":514.657,"stop":517.958,"duration":3.3},{"text":"The PRDC reactor will not slow the

have.","start":528.235,"stop":534.024,"duration":5.79},{"text":"The fast neutrons, when they hit U-238, the non-fissionable Uranium, a certain proportion of them turn the non-fissionable Uranium into
