state law.","start":199.923,"stop":208.91,"duration":8.99},{"text":"And we feel that Constance versus Harvey is just another instance where you find the rights of the trustee in bankruptcy by reference to the language of the Bankruptcy Act and not by reference to the rights of any actual questionable creditor under state law.","start":208.91,"stop":225.599,"duration":16.69},{"text":"There are many other examples in the Bankruptcy Act where these rights are in excessive creditor's rights under state law.","start":225.599,"stop":231.223,"duration":5.62},{"text":"Section 60 allows the trustee to invalidate preference obtained within four months of bankruptcy.","start":231.223,"stop":237.781,"duration":6.56},{"text":"Many States including Michigan do not give creditors this right

insolvency.","start":237.781,"stop":251.524,"duration":13.74},{"text":"We are not aware of any State in the union which allows creditors to accomplish this fact.","start":251.524,"stop":256.519,"duration":5},{"text":"And finally, we come to Section 70e of the Bankruptcy Act which is that section where the trustee's rights in fact are derivative.","start":256.519,"stop":264.281,"duration":7.76},{"text":"The trustee under Section 70e has placed in the shoes of an actual flesh and blood creditor under the various state registration laws, under the famous case of Moore versus Bay which was decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1931.","start":264.281,"stop":279.383,"duration":15.1},{"text":"The decision in that case was rendered by Justice Holmes.","start":279.383,"stop":282.889,"duration":3.51},{"text":"The Supreme Court allowed the trustee in bankruptcy to invalidate a California chattel mortgage for the benefit of all creditors of the State even though without the intervention of bankruptcy, this creditor could only have invalidated the mortgage to the extent of his own obligation.","start":282.889,"stop":302.409,"duration":19.52},{"text":"Therefore, in essence, a $10 mortgage -- a $10 obligation could invalidate a million dollar

1938, Congress codified this particular section in Section 70e (2), so that where in actual creditor under state law could only invalidate the mortgage the extent of his obligation, the Supreme Court held that the trustee had rights which were in excessively creditor under state law and it could have validated in toto.","start":315.439,"stop":336.6,"duration":21.16},{"text":"Now, the respondent's charge at the Second Circuit in Constance versus Harvey, wrenched the word, and I quote, \"Could have obtained a lien out of the Section 70c of the Bankruptcy Act and gave them an affect which was contrary to its true meaning and the legislative intent.\"","start":336.6,"stop":353.578,"duration":16.98},{"text":"And we say this just isn't so.","start":353.578,"stop":355.944,"duration":2.37},{"text":"Constance versus Harvey or the doctrine said forth therein was the law prior to this decision in 1954 and was the law prior to the amendment to the Bankruptcy Act in 1952 which inserted the words \"could have obtained a lien\".","start":355.944,"stop":370.153,"duration":14.21},{"text":"The predecessor to Section 70c was Section 47a (2) which was passed in 1910 and which vested the trustee with the rights of a lien creditor at the date of bankruptcy.","start":370.153,"stop":382.689,"duration":12.54},{"text":"It did not use the words \"whether or not such a creditor actually exist\".","start":382.689,"stop":387.188,"duration":4.5},{"text":"And one of the first cases, decided under this law with In re Calhoun which was a District Court case of Alabama in 1911.","start":387.188,"stop":396.508,"duration":9.32},{"text":"In that case, we have an unrecorded conditional sales contract.","start":396.508,"stop":400.454,"duration":3.95},{"text":"Alabama law protected a creditor who extended credit between the date of execution and the date of recording of a conditional sales contract.","start":400.454,"stop":410.053,"duration":9.6},{"text":"There was no evidence of the existence of such a creditor.","start":410.053,"stop":413.72,"duration":3.67},{"text":"And the Court held that since Section 47a (2), that's the trustee where the rights of a lien creditor that necessarily included within these rights where the rights of the most favored class of creditors under state law and under Alabama law, this was a creditor who would obtain a judgement between execution and recording.","start":413.72,"stop":435.4,"duration":21.68},{"text":"And on page 16 of our brief, I'd like to refer to two very vital paragraphs in this opinion.","start":435.4,"stop":443.815,"duration":8.42},{"text":"\"The purpose of Congress,\" and I'm quoting, \"was to embrace within these words every class of creditors with liens by legal or equitable proceedings favored by the bearing registration laws of each of the State.","start":443.815,"stop":458.805,"duration":14.99},{"text":"The registration laws of some of the States include but one of many classes of such creditors.","start":458.805,"stop":465.035,"duration":6.23},{"text":"In that case, the purpose of Congress is not to be frustrated as to the included class because other classes included within the amendment were not included also in the Registration Act of that particular State.\"","start":465.035,"stop":479.342,"duration":14.31},{"text":"And in the third paragraph which is very vital, \"The test is whether there exist a class properly within the language of the amendment and that of the Alabama Registration Act.","start":479.342,"stop":491.634,"duration":12.29},{"text":"It is conceded that a judgement creditor holding a lien by execution is such a class.","start":491.634,"stop":497.434,"duration":5.8},{"text":"The trustee, therefore, is vested with the right by the amendment and the Registration Act of that class to avoid unrecorded conditional sales contracts.\"","start":497.434,"stop":507.349,"duration":9.91},{"text":"And this had to be their position because in the 50 States, you have 50 bearing registration laws.","start":507.349,"stop":514.672,"duration":7.32},{"text":"Some protect creditors who extend credit in the interim between executions and recordings.","start":514.672,"stop":520.014,"duration":5.34},{"text":"Some protect judgment creditors.","start":520.014,"stop":521.993,"duration":1.98},{"text":"Some protect lien creditors.","start":521.993,"stop":524.051,"duration":2.06},{"text":"Some of the statutes require immediate recording, others allow reasonable time to record.","start":524.051,"stop":529.663,"duration":5.61},{"text":"And as a result, the Bankruptcy Act has to be applied uniformly.","start":529.663,"stop":534.37,"duration":4.71},{"text":"And this Court held, in effect, that if there is a class of protected creditors under the State Registration Act, then the trustee is a member of the most favored class plus a lien at the date of bankruptcy.","start":534.37,"stop":546.359,"duration":11.99},{"text":"Further evidence of the application of the doctrine of Constance verus Harvey prior to this decision were two very interesting cases which arose out of the Seventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit respectively.","start":546.359,"stop":557.826,"duration":11.47},{"text":"One was In re Urban which involve a Michigan chattel mortgage and the other was McKay versus Trusco Finance Company of Montgomery, Alabama which involved an Alabama chattel mortgage.","start":557.826,"stop":568.86,"duration":11.03},{"text":"In both cases, the chattel mortgage was not recorded prior to the date of bankruptcy.Both States protect an interim creditor who extends credit between the date of execution and the date of the recording of the chattel mortgage.","start":568.86,"stop":583.794,"duration":14.93},{"text":"It's important to know that in both of these cases, there was no evidence of the existence of a simple contract creditor who extend a credit between the date of execution and the date of recording.","start":583.794,"stop":594.304,"duration":10.51},{"text":"This being the type of creditor protected.","start":594.304,"stop":596.574,"duration":2.27},{"text":"And as a result, the trustee could not use Section 70e.","start":596.574,"stop":601.443,"duration":4.87},{"text":"In both cases, the courts allowed the trustee to invalidate these mortgages under Section 70c and it's important to note that if a lien was obtained between the date of execution and the date of recording of these mortgages, that these particular instruments could not have been invalidated.","start":601.443,"stop":617.709,"duration":16.27},{"text":"So the Court held in effect that the trustee is a lien creditor at the date of bankruptcy, and the Urban case used this language.","start":617.709,"stop":624.412,"duration":6.7},{"text":"And that necessarily included within his status of a lien creditor at the date of bankruptcy is the status of a lessor creditor who was a member of the most favored class under state law.","start":624.412,"stop":637.58,"duration":13.17},{"text":"Now, the critiques of Constance versus Harvey claim that if the interpretation of the Second Circuit of Section 70c is correct, then it makes Section 70e superposed and then why didn't Congress just repeal this Section?","start":637.58,"stop":650.084,"duration":12.5},{"text":"And again, we say this just isn't so.","start":650.084,"stop":652.485,"duration":2.4},{"text":"The States have divided into two main groups as to the class of protect -- creditors who are protected under the state registration laws.","start":652.485,"stop":659.745,"duration":7.26},{"text":"The minority group of States which include the big commercial States of New York, California, Illinois, Michigan state that a simple contract creditor who extends credit between execution and recording is the protected class of creditors under their state laws, thus, if a lien is obtained between execution and recording, it does not protect the creditor in those States.","start":659.745,"stop":681.617,"duration":21.87},{"text":"In the majority of the States including those who follow the Uniform Commercial Code, a creditor who fastens a lien between the date of execution and the date of the recording of the mortgage is the type of creditor who is protected under their Registration Act regardless of when credit is extended.","start":681.617,"stop":698.317,"duration":16.7},{"text":"Now, let's apply Constance versus Harvey to these two separate sets of groups of States.","start":698.317,"stop":703.197,"duration":4.88},{"text":"If the chattel mortgage, if the chattel mortgage is not recorded prior to bankruptcy, then both groups of States have held that the trustee may use the Section 70c to invalidate this chattel mortgages and respondents admit this in their brief.","start":703.197,"stop":720.332,"duration":17.13},{"text":"Now, the trustee is a lien creditor to hold this in both group of States especially in the interim contract creditor State, you would have to say that included within his status of a lien creditor is a simple contract creditor.","start":720.332,"stop":734.603,"duration":14.27},{"text":"If the chattel mortgage was recorded prior to bankruptcy, then Constance versus Harvey recognizes this distinction.","start":734.603,"stop":741.967,"duration":7.36},{"text":"In those States that only require a simple contract creditor who extends credit between the date of execution and the date of recording, the trustee could use Section 70c to invalidate these chattel mortgages.","start":741.967,"stop":755.615,"duration":13.65},{"text":"In those States which require a lien creditor who is -- who must fasten a lien between the date of execution and the date of recording, Constance versus Harvey in it's interpretation, could not possibly apply because this distinction is recognized by that decision, that the lien is a lien at the date of bankruptcy and does not relate back as charged by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and by the respondents.","start":755.615,"stop":779.269,"duration":23.65},{"text":"This lien does not relate back.","start":779.269,"stop":781.681,"duration":2.41},{"text":"And as a result in those States, unless you could find an actual flesh and blood creditor under Section 70e of the Act, the trustee could not invalidate a chattel mortgage.","start":781.681,"stop":791.642,"duration":9.96},{"text":"Now, the Sixth Circuit and the respondents fail to --","start":791.642,"stop":793.184,"duration":1.54}]},{"speakerName":"Potter
