naked.","start":120.42,"stop":126.813,"duration":6.39},{"text":"Immediately thereafter, another officer ordered Mrs. Monroe to get out of her

room.","start":161.97,"stop":166.688,"duration":4.72},{"text":"At about the same time, other officers were awakening the six Monroe children and herding them into the living room.","start":166.688,"stop":177.721,"duration":11.03},{"text":"Meanwhile, still other officers began an exhaustive search of the premises.","start":177.721,"stop":184.194,"duration":6.47},{"text":"It commenced in the Monroe bedroom when one of the officers went into the closet there and he pulled all the clothes off the hangers, examined each one separately and threw each garment on the floor.","start":184.194,"stop":199.487,"duration":15.29},{"text":"Still other officers went through the various chests of drawers and other pieces of furniture in the apartment.","start":199.487,"stop":206.332,"duration":6.84},{"text":"They pulled out the drawers, they dumped them on the floor, and I suppose we may infer from the complaint although it is not expressly stated, they then examined the various articles which had been dumped on the floor.","start":206.332,"stop":224.138,"duration":17.81},{"text":"While the children were being herded into the living room, one of the officers, for reasons which are not stated in the complaint, kicked James Monroe, Jr. who is a four-year-old child.","start":224.138,"stop":244.486,"duration":20.35},{"text":"And young Jimmy Monroe fell down and he started to cry.","start":244.486,"stop":255.539,"duration":11.05},{"text":"Pape was in the living room at this point and he was addressing questions to Mr. James Monroe.","start":255.539,"stop":265.508,"duration":9.97},{"text":"Pape had this flashlight in his hand that had -- he had shone in the faces of the sleeping couple when he first entered the bedroom.","start":265.508,"stop":274.223,"duration":8.72},{"text":"And as the Deputy Chief of Detectives would ask these questions at Mr. Monroe, he was striking or punching this flashlight into the stomach of the naked man while his children and his wife looked on.","start":274.223,"stop":297.737,"duration":23.51},{"text":"For reasons which are not alleged in the complaint, one of the officers, I believe it -- it was Deputy Chief Pape, had occasion to strike Robert Stevens who was the stepchild of James Monroe knocking him to the floor and thereafter to -- pushed Houston Stevens, the brother of Robert Stevens, down to the floor in such a way that he fell across Robert's body.","start":297.737,"stop":332.205,"duration":34.47},{"text":"The daughter in the Monroe family, Jacqueline Stevens, panicked and she rushed to the back door.","start":332.205,"stop":340.801,"duration":8.6},{"text":"An officer was standing near the backdoor.","start":340.801,"stop":344.562,"duration":3.76},{"text":"He stepped in front of Jacqueline.","start":344.562,"stop":346.819,"duration":2.26},{"text":"It is alleged in the complaint that Jacqueline's intent at this time was to get out into -- out of the apartment into a hallway to reach a telephone so that she might call someone and get help.","start":346.819,"stop":364.332,"duration":17.51},{"text":"The officer near the backdoor stepped in front of her and pushed her down to the floor.","start":364.332,"stop":373.816,"duration":9.48},{"text":"The officers then completed an exhaustive search of the premises.","start":373.816,"stop":377.546,"duration":3.73},{"text":"This included among other things, taking razorblades and slitting open the mattresses on the various beds in the apartment as well as the other incidents to the search that I have described.","start":377.546,"stop":392.366,"duration":14.82},{"text":"After some time, James Monroe was permitted to dress, and then his hands were cuffed together and he was led out to an automobile which was parked near the apartment.","start":392.366,"stop":410.467,"duration":18.1},{"text":"He was placed in the automobile.","start":410.467,"stop":412.025,"duration":1.56},{"text":"He was driven eventually to the Central Police Headquarters of the Chicago Police Department where he was taken up to a place of detention.","start":412.025,"stop":423.908,"duration":11.88},{"text":"And he was there interrogated from time to time, subjected to intermittent interrogation, I believe it is the way it was phrased in the complaint.","start":423.908,"stop":436.288,"duration":12.38},{"text":"And from time to time, he was placed on exhibition in police line-ups to which witnesses and other police officers come to view various individuals who are within the power of the police at that time.","start":436.288,"stop":452.054,"duration":15.77},{"text":"After 10 hours, Mr. Monroe was released from custody.","start":452.054,"stop":455.241,"duration":3.19},{"text":"He was not charged with a crime.","start":455.241,"stop":456.959,"duration":1.72},{"text":"He has never been charged with a crime from that day to this.","start":456.959,"stop":462.634,"duration":5.68},{"text":"It was alleged that during this 10-hour detention at the Central Police Headquarters, Mr. Monroe was refused permission to call his family.","start":462.634,"stop":471.489,"duration":8.85},{"text":"He was refused permission to call his attorney.","start":471.489,"stop":474.772,"duration":3.28},{"text":"No charges were placed against him.","start":474.772,"stop":478.624,"duration":3.85},{"text":"He was refused any information as to what charges would be placed against him.","start":478.624,"stop":483.07,"duration":4.45},{"text":"Of course, he could not, as we alleged in the complaint, make bail because no bail had been set because no charge had been filed.","start":483.07,"stop":490.626,"duration":7.56},{"text":"In short, the allegations make out a classic case of incommunicado detention.","start":490.626,"stop":498.994,"duration":8.37},{"text":"It's the same thing that happens in all of these cases that this Court has had before it so -- so very often in the coerced confession situation.","start":498.994,"stop":512.764,"duration":13.77},{"text":"We alleged that the officers never had any intent of bringing Mr. Monroe before a judge promptly and that he was not arrested for this purpose.","start":512.764,"stop":528.174,"duration":15.41},{"text":"We further alleged that in the building where Mr. Monroe was held for this 10 hours, there were four branches of the Municipal Court of Chicago with jurisdiction to receive criminal complaints and admit prisoners to bail and that elsewhere in the city there were 16 other branches of the Municipal Court with similar jurisdiction, and we have identified each one of these branches by number in the complaint.","start":528.174,"stop":556.319,"duration":28.14},{"text":"We contend that having alleged these facts, and specifically invoked Title 28, Section 1343 to support federal jurisdiction and Revised Statute Section 1979, which defines our cause of action.","start":556.319,"stop":574.917,"duration":18.6},{"text":"Our complaint should not have been stricken but that the defendant should have been required to answer it and we should have proceeded to trial.","start":574.917,"stop":582.187,"duration":7.27}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Moore, by what means did the police gain admission to the apartment?","start":582.187,"stop":587.779,"duration":5.59}]},{"speakerName":"Donald Page Moore","textObjs":[{"text":"The -- the phrase in the complaint, Your Honor, and I believe that's in paragraph 10 (a) of the complaint, which is the second paragraph on page 3 of the record, is that the defendant, \"broke and entered the apartment\".","start":587.779,"stop":606.395,"duration":18.62},{"text":"Now, that is all that the complaint itself says.","start":606.395,"stop":610.772,"duration":4.38},{"text":"If I were to go in more detail, I would have to go outside the record.","start":610.772,"stop":614.549,"duration":3.78},{"text":"As a matter of fact, one means was used at the front door and a different means was used at the back door.","start":614.549,"stop":624.691,"duration":10.14},{"text":"I think it couldn't prejudice the defendants if I informed the Court that the back door was not broken down.","start":624.691,"stop":635.741,"duration":11.05},{"text":"It's conceivable that the door was pounded on and someone came and that somebody said, \"Police, let us in\", in the case of the back door.","start":635.741,"stop":645.74,"duration":10},{"text":"Of course, that's -- that's the words of the record but I don't think it's prejudicial to the city since it negates the inference that the back door was broken down.","start":645.74,"stop":658.864,"duration":13.12},{"text":"We believe that we have alleged the three elements which are required by Revised Statute Section 1979 which are quite simple.","start":658.864,"stop":669.57,"duration":10.71},{"text":"First of all, the plaintiff must be a citizen or other person within the jurisdiction of the United States and at page one of the record, paragraph 2 of Count 1 of the complaint, we alleged that the plaintiffs are citizens or other individuals within the jurisdiction of the United States.","start":669.57,"stop":685.058,"duration":15.49},{"text":"So we believe that we have satisfied that requirement of the statute.","start":685.058,"stop":690.222,"duration":5.16},{"text":"The statute requires that the acts complained of must be committed under color of a state law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage.","start":690.222,"stop":701.382,"duration":11.16},{"text":"In paragraph 6 of the complaint on page 2 of the record, we allege that the defendants were acting under color of the statutes, ordinances, regulations, customs and usage of the State of Illinois, County Cook, City of Chicago.","start":701.382,"stop":719.132,"duration":17.75},{"text":"And in support of that conclusion we have alleged in paragraph 3 on page 1 of the record and in paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 at page 2 of the record, that these officers were on duty, they were acting in the course of their official duty, they were acting subject to the orders of the Detective Bureau, that they were led by a Deputy Chief of Detectives, that they were acting in the name of the City of Chicago on behalf of the City of Chicago, that they were carrying official badges and identification cards which were furnished to them by the City of Chicago for the purpose of identifying them as the agents of the City of Chicago, that they were acting within the scope of their employment.","start":719.132,"stop":770.655,"duration":51.52},{"text":"And we believe that this makes out a case of color of law as that statutory phrase was defined in Screws versus The United States, 325 U.S. and Williams versus The United States, 341 U.S. and we contend in the Classic case the decision of this Court in 1940 or 1941.","start":770.655,"stop":803.706,"duration":33.05},{"text":"Screws held that if a person acts under pretense of law, then he has acted under color of law.","start":803.706,"stop":813.843,"duration":10.14},{"text":"If he is a servant of the state going about the state's business, he has acted under color of law even though his acts may be in violation of applicable statutes or constitutional provisions of the state.","start":813.843,"stop":828.279,"duration":14.44},{"text":"Screws, of course, was a case where a Georgia sheriff beat a negro prisoner to death and it's perfectly clear that such acts were a violation of Georgia law.","start":828.279,"stop":840.137,"duration":11.86},{"text":"Nevertheless, the sheriff was held to have acted under color of law within the meaning of Title 18, Section 242.","start":840.137,"stop":849.666,"duration":9.53}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"Because does -- Screws

of law.","start":888.149,"stop":891.9,"duration":3.75},{"text":"This is not so with regard to Revised Statute Section 1979 where the word state is inserted.","start":891.9,"stop":898.786,"duration":6.89},{"text":"However the -- outside of that, I believe that the color of law phraseology of Section 242 is precisely the
