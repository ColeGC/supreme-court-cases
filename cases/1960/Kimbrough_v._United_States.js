Government and petitioner can be quickly set out and would show the dimensions of the problem before us.","start":261.462,"stop":271.489,"duration":10.03},{"text":"Petitioner's contention is essentially this, that under the statute properly construed a single defendant may, with respect to a single automobile, be charged with only one offense.","start":271.489,"stop":291.825,"duration":20.34},{"text":"That is that during a period of time here the statute -- the indictment charged that between January 19th and February 13th, the

within the period charged in receiving, concealing, and storing count that he transported this automobile in interstate commerce.","start":308.077,"stop":319.348,"duration":11.27},{"text":"Now, the broad contention then of the petitioner here, if it would not regard to what things -- petitioner may have done with this automobile without regard to where he kept it, without regard to whether he took it across six state lines or one state line.","start":319.348,"stop":336.32,"duration":16.97},{"text":"Not regard to whether he repainted motor numbers, re-changed the motor numbers, repainted the car whatever else he did.","start":336.32,"stop":342.552,"duration":6.23},{"text":"He properly construed this statute under this statute that he can be convicted of only one crime.","start":342.552,"stop":349.551,"duration":7},{"text":"Now, the Governor's con -- the Government's contention is set forth in their brief, was to much broader contention and that is, as I understand it that in this context, a person may be charged with an almost indefinite number of crimes and receive consecutive sentences so long as he commits separate acts with reference to this automobile.","start":349.551,"stop":373.414,"duration":23.86},{"text":"And the Government's position says that the issue turns at least upon the question of whether or not separate acts were committed.","start":373.414,"stop":384.07,"duration":10.66},{"text":"Now, two examples that may serve to illustrate the problem that we're dealing with, one example would be the case of the professional thief which steals a car in one State, immediately transports to another State and disposes of it to offense.","start":384.07,"stop":400.238,"duration":16.17},{"text":"Under the Government's contention, the State would be chargeable only with one or most and decision of the Government says it's not before us, because it isn't two crimes and it could get most of 10-year sentence under this circumstances.","start":400.238,"stop":417.26,"duration":17.02},{"text":"Now, you take the other type situation, the man who steals the car in order to use it instead of to sell it and he manages to be successful until elude capture for a period of time, three weeks, three months, three years.","start":417.26,"stop":432.064,"duration":14.8},{"text":"And during this period of time, he does many things with his automobile.","start":432.064,"stop":435.618,"duration":3.55},{"text":"He stole it for the purpose of using it.","start":435.618,"stop":437.454,"duration":1.84},{"text":"He may have transported into across 10 States.","start":437.454,"stop":440.885,"duration":3.43},{"text":"He may have repainted it, changed the licence by strange motor number.","start":440.885,"stop":444.54,"duration":3.66},{"text":"It did many things for his automobile.","start":444.54,"stop":447.062,"duration":2.52},{"text":"The Government's contention -- and they set it out clearly at page 13 of their brief seems to be that for each of these offenses he might now be separately punished.","start":447.062,"stop":457.068,"duration":10.01},{"text":"The example I gave you it easily see a sentence of 100 years.","start":457.068,"stop":462.384,"duration":5.32},{"text":"Theoretically, resulting from all these separate acts of transporting and concealing which might take place during the period that he had the automobile.","start":462.384,"stop":470.881,"duration":8.5},{"text":"So, the case comes to issue here, because on the face of the indictment, the petitioner can only show that he was charged with concealing and storing over a period of time an automobile, and that within that period of time, he was charged with transporting the same automobile.","start":470.881,"stop":491.122,"duration":20.24},{"text":"Now, the statute, but as the petitioner goes on -- petitioner is further pointed that the statute is broad.","start":491.122,"stop":500.8,"duration":9.68},{"text":"He looked at the statute as it set out.","start":500.8,"stop":504.174,"duration":3.37},{"text":"The petitioner's brief, the statute says in Section 3, \"Whoever shall transport or cause to be transported in interstate or foreign commerce and motor vehicle somewhere.\"","start":504.174,"stop":513.171,"duration":9},{"text":"Section 4, whoever shall receive, conceal, store or barter sell or dispose of any motor vehicle moving as or which as a part of interstate or foreign commerce law.","start":513.171,"stop":524.158,"duration":10.99},{"text":"Now, petitioner's contention is that this statute was conceived in the state of this broadly.","start":524.158,"stop":529.056,"duration":4.9},{"text":"In order that the Government could prosecute each person who had anything to do with this stolen car knowing that it had been stolen.","start":529.056,"stop":539.494,"duration":10.44},{"text":"So that if one individual repainted the -- re-changed the motor number, if another individual received it and sold it, if the third individual get it, if -- if you had a series of individuals dealing with this automobile, if they could all be separately punished and -- but if it was not intended, the Government contends here that when one individual having a car committed these separate acts then he could so be punished with an additional five years sentence possible for each of these separate acts.","start":539.494,"stop":569.733,"duration":30.24},{"text":"Now, the statute on its phase does not resolve the issue.","start":569.733,"stop":574.699,"duration":4.97},{"text":"The legislative history is sparse and conceivably could be ready to weigh, each petitioner contends there is no legislative history, some support for his contention that Congress is primarily thinking of getting at different persons, instead of multiplying offenses against to single person.","start":574.699,"stop":596.641,"duration":21.94},{"text":"If you look at page 11 at the petitioner's brief, they set out irrelevant portions of the House Committee report when this statute was presented to Congress.","start":596.641,"stop":608.216,"duration":11.58},{"text":"The report points out, that state laws have been inadequate to meet the evil because of the interstate movement of cars making it difficult for the States to apprehend them.","start":608.216,"stop":620.307,"duration":12.09},{"text":"And then it says in about the fourth sentence, thieves steal automobiles and take them from one State to another and often times have associates in the crime who receive and sell the stolen machines.","start":620.307,"stop":633.428,"duration":13.12},{"text":"Congress there seemed to be thinking of different persons.","start":633.428,"stop":637.469,"duration":4.04},{"text":"The same thing was reiterated when Congressman Dreier, the sponsor of the legislation spoken the floor of the House, statement setout at the bottom of page 12.","start":637.469,"stop":650.63,"duration":13.16},{"text":"The bill provides gentlemen for only two things, Section 3 provides for the punishment of a thief stealing a car and transporting it from one State to another.","start":650.63,"stop":660.112,"duration":9.48},{"text":"Section 4 provides for the receipt of the stolen car by thieves in another State for the purpose of selling and disposing of it.","start":660.112,"stop":666.943,"duration":6.83},{"text":"Again, the emphasis seemed to be on the two person category the thief and the receiver as being separate.","start":666.943,"stop":675.174,"duration":8.23},{"text":"The only thing in the Senate debate seems to bare on the issue as to somewhat ambiguous statement by Senator Cummins.","start":675.174,"stop":682.181,"duration":7.01},{"text":"This is the statement which the petitioner reads one way and the Governor -- Government reads another way.","start":682.181,"stop":686.331,"duration":4.15},{"text":"This is set out on page 13.","start":686.331,"stop":689.176,"duration":2.85},{"text":"Senator Cummins said, \"The first section is intended to punish anyone who does the thing, that is transporting knowing the vehicle have been stolen\".","start":689.176,"stop":697.825,"duration":8.65},{"text":"Further practice is it possible to dispose the vehicle to some other party to -- or otherwise when it gets across the state line.","start":697.825,"stop":705.577,"duration":7.75},{"text":"And Section 4 is for the purpose of punishing a man in bars herself or disposes of the property with intent to deprive the owner of the possession thereof or if he conceals it knowing it to have been stolen.","start":705.577,"stop":716.859,"duration":11.28},{"text":"I think that would probably embrace every case that could be reached.","start":716.859,"stop":720.61,"duration":3.75},{"text":"Petitioner's contention here is that he was saying only that he is possible to dispose a vehicle to some other party and then Section 4 is for punishing a man that is the other party who have been gotten the car bought or sells or disposes of the property with intent to deprive the owner of the possession, and not that he was mean in this -- to say that Section 4 was designed to punish not only this person, but also to impose an additional person on the transporter, this additional punishment on the transporter.","start":720.61,"stop":756.183,"duration":35.57},{"text":"Now, this isn't much in the way of substantial legislative history, but this is about what there is on the subject.","start":756.183,"stop":765.935,"duration":9.75},{"text":"Now, given this posture, petitioner argues this is certainly inappropriate case for applying the general doctrine of statutory instruction -- construction which has been known as the Rule of Lenity which has been set forth by this Court in a series of cases.","start":765.935,"stop":785.849,"duration":19.91},{"text":"And while each of these cases have involved particular factual situations and particular statutes, in each of then the rule has been stated broadly in the CIT credit corporation case.","start":785.849,"stop":798.491,"duration":12.64},{"text":"This Court said when a choice that has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime.","start":798.491,"stop":804.682,"duration":6.19},{"text":"It is appropriate before we choose the harsh role alternative to require that Congress should have spoken any language that is clear and definite.","start":804.682,"stop":812.287,"duration":7.61},{"text":"We should not derive criminal outlawry from some ambiguous implication.","start":812.287,"stop":816.826,"duration":4.54},{"text":"In Bell, it may fairly be said that there are presumptive position of our law to result doubts and the enforcement of a penal code against the imposition of a hardship punishment.","start":816.826,"stop":827.471,"duration":10.64},{"text":"Prince reference is made to the policy of not attributing to Congress in the enactment of criminal statutes and an intention to punish more severely from the language of its laws clearly in courts, and so on.","start":827.471,"stop":839.252,"duration":11.78},{"text":"It seems the petitioner, this is an appropriate case.","start":839.252,"stop":841.875,"duration":2.62},{"text":"And to have here -- first, I think it's important to note that we have here a situation for the Federal Government interest, its basically an interest is assisting the State to law enforcement.","start":841.875,"stop":852.444,"duration":10.57},{"text":"This statute has passed, as said in the legislative history because the States were not able to cope with the problem of stolen automobiles knowing in the interstate commerce.","start":852.444,"stop":863.748,"duration":11.3},{"text":"It's relevant here then I think to note that generally speaking, in the law of law of larceny which is the law, the States would be applying the stolen cars.","start":863.748,"stop":872.149,"duration":8.4},{"text":"Generally speaking in the law of larceny, legislatures in the common law have not carved up a crime that a man steals something, he steals it for what purpose, to use it, to sell it, to dispose evidence (Inaudible).","start":872.149,"stop":888.43,"duration":16.28},{"text":"And these things have all been regarded as part of a single crime, and generally, unless you have specific statute, specifically setting them up.","start":888.43,"stop":897.166,"duration":8.74},{"text":"The law has not dealt with the thief by saying, \"We'll impose one punishment on you for stealing the article, a separate punishment on you for keeping it, and maybe a third punishment, because you now sold it to somebody else.\"","start":897.166,"stop":909.625,"duration":12.46},{"text":"Now, since this statute was enacted against this general background of the law of larceny, it would seem that Congress was not here trying to say that each of these acts that the Government talks about is to be regarded in such a criminal offense that a man may potentially be given an additional five-year sentence for each of them.","start":909.625,"stop":929.426,"duration":19.8},{"text":"But every time he takes the car across another state line that every time he conceals the car in a garage so the police will not find it, that every time he repaints it, that every time he changes the motor number, that each of this succession of acts, all of which are properly incident and really a part of the basic concept here that these should each be regarded as separate criminal acts for which he could receive an additional punishment of five years, since the petitioner highly doubtful what Congress intended such a harsh result.","start":929.426,"stop":965.369,"duration":35.94},{"text":"The emphasis as a matter of fact in the legislative history is upon the type situation of the professional thief, who steals occur in one State and quickly disposes of it in another State.","start":965.369,"stop":976.499,"duration":11.13},{"text":"And under the argument put forth by the Government, he would receive the least punishment, the man who stole the car to use it, the joyrider and they've been joyrider problems under this statute.","start":976.499,"stop":988.229,"duration":11.73},{"text":"The serviceman who steals the car to get home who, in the process of using the car, goes through several States who -- who may do a number of acts with respect to that automobile.","start":988.229,"stop":998.911,"duration":10.68},{"text":"He's the one which under this interpretation the statute would permit a pyramiding of consecutive punishments.","start":998.911,"stop":1006.744,"duration":7.83},{"text":"Now, this punishment -- obviously the -- this is all subject to the discretion of the prosecution and would have been charged for discretion of the Court as to what it was sentence.","start":1006.744,"stop":1017.365,"duration":10.62},{"text":"But petitioner's petition for -- position that there seems to be no useful purpose served by so construing this statute in the absence of explicit congressional -- explicit congressional spelling out to permit that kind of nullification punishment.","start":1017.365,"stop":1036.755,"duration":19.39},{"text":"It seems to bare no reasonable relationship to what Congress was getting at.","start":1036.755,"stop":1041.133,"duration":4.38},{"text":"It would not seem that criminality multiplies as a factor of time which would seem to be the result of the peti -- of the position taken by the Government, and it would seem that a proper construction here would be a construction contended for by the petitioner which would permit the imposition of a substantial punishment of five years in the federal penitentiary upon any person who commits any of these prescribed acts with reference to a stolen automobile which is transported in interstate commerce.","start":1041.133,"stop":1074.782,"duration":33.65},{"text":"But -- and further, that it would permit the Government to secure a conviction by charging and proving anyone acting a change, so

vehicles.","start":1094.349,"stop":1117.413,"duration":23.06},{"text":"Now, essentially, this then is the position of the petitioner to start with the fact that they have no notion what the actual
