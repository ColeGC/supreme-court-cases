take away that extra push.","start":229.617,"stop":236.286,"duration":6.67},{"text":"The other brief comment I should like to make is an address to an argument which appellant makes, which seems to me, in large part, semantic, but I think it deserves a word of comment.","start":236.286,"stop":247.664,"duration":11.38},{"text":"In their briefs and yesterday, the theme recurs that the trouble with this judgment is that it does not suppress the evil or the disease itself.","start":247.664,"stop":259.457,"duration":11.79},{"text":"It only suppresses the effects or the symptoms.","start":259.457,"stop":263.661,"duration":4.2},{"text":"I think that argument is an argument in which (Inaudible) tries to do the work of analysis, because what appellant describes as the symptoms or the effects, in my judgment, is the evil or the illegality itself.","start":263.661,"stop":280.315,"duration":16.65},{"text":"The statute does not prohibit the acquisition of stock per se.","start":280.315,"stop":286.281,"duration":5.97},{"text":"It prohibits the acquisition of stock when certain economic consequences or the probability of those consequences follows.","start":286.281,"stop":295.149,"duration":8.87},{"text":"With the Court's permission with some diffidence, I should like to refer to the mandate of this Court in this case because I think that mandate properly construed the statute.","start":295.149,"stop":306.618,"duration":11.47},{"text":"The mandate directed the District Court to enter a judgment which would eliminate the consequences of the stock acquisition which were offensive to the statute.","start":306.618,"stop":318.836,"duration":12.22},{"text":"That is what the District Court did.","start":318.836,"stop":320.863,"duration":2.03},{"text":"And when it eliminated those -- the probability of those consequences, which is what this judgment did, it eliminated the disease and the illegality and the evil as well as the symptoms and the effects.","start":320.863,"stop":334.936,"duration":14.07},{"text":"Now, that brings me to appellant's legal argument that divestiture is a mandatory remedy in all Section 7 cases.","start":334.936,"stop":343.899,"duration":8.96},{"text":"As counsel for appellant quite candidally stated yesterday, this is an argument of why the application -- it means that in every Section 7 case, there must be complete divestiture of the legal title even though admittedly, that may not be necessary to effective relief.","start":343.899,"stop":360.473,"duration":16.57},{"text":"And even though admittedly, it may inflict injurious consequences on persons who were innocent in any real sense, of any wrongdoing.","start":360.473,"stop":369.512,"duration":9.04},{"text":"That is as -- an application.","start":369.512,"stop":371.191,"duration":1.68},{"text":"It has nothing to do with the facts to this case as I understand it.","start":371.191,"stop":373.92,"duration":2.73},{"text":"It goes across the board in every case, no matter what the facts are.","start":373.92,"stop":379.836,"duration":5.92},{"text":"Now, appellant also frankly conceded that it gets little comfort from the words of Section 15, which is the source of the Court's jurisdiction in this case.","start":379.836,"stop":388.513,"duration":8.68},{"text":"To grant a jurisdiction is general, the Section does not specify any particular remedy or remedies.","start":388.513,"stop":395.525,"duration":7.01},{"text":"I suggest to the Court that at the very outset, appellant's argument runs into direct conflict with the principle -- with the principle this Court has laid down.","start":395.525,"stop":407.686,"duration":12.16},{"text":"That limitations and restrictions on the equity jurisdiction, the historic equity powers of the federal courts, are not to be imposed by implication or inference or innuendo, but nothing short of a direct and explicit statutory command will do.","start":407.686,"stop":427.813,"duration":20.13},{"text":"We have cited at page 120 of our brief, cases including Hecht against Bowles and Stewart against Warner which announced and applied that principle.","start":427.813,"stop":438.919,"duration":11.11},{"text":"I think the appellant's difficulties are enhanced and not assisted when you consider the relationship between Section 15 of the Clayton Act and Section 4 of the Sherman Act.","start":438.919,"stop":451.911,"duration":12.99},{"text":"The two Sections are stated in exactly the same words.","start":451.911,"stop":456.513,"duration":4.6},{"text":"And the legislative history of Section 15, and there is no dispute between us on this point, shows that when Congress passed Section 15, it said, is intended to give the federal courts the same power, same range of equitable discretion under Section 15 (a) and under Section 4.","start":456.513,"stop":476.053,"duration":19.54},{"text":"Now, as I understand the appellant's argument, it says that under Section 4 in Sherman Act cases, divestiture is mandatory in certain kinds of situation, to wit, where the heart of the illegality is the acquisition of stock.","start":476.053,"stop":492.511,"duration":16.46},{"text":"There is nothing in the words of Section 4 which says that and there's nothing in the legislative history of Section 4 or Section 15 which says that.","start":492.511,"stop":502.086,"duration":9.57},{"text":"But appellant says that as a matter of judicial interpretation prior to the passage of the Clayton Act, that principle had been recognized and that Congress must have been aware of that and therefore, when Congress passed Section 15, it intended, although it did not say so that divestiture should be a mandatory remedy in certain class of cases.","start":502.086,"stop":526.44,"duration":24.35},{"text":"I suggest that the decision of this Court in United States against the Terminal Company of St. Louis is fatal to that argument.","start":526.44,"stop":535.376,"duration":8.94},{"text":"That case was decided in 1912, two years before the passage of the Clayton Act.","start":535.376,"stop":541.367,"duration":5.99},{"text":"The heart of the illegality in that case was the acquisition of stock.","start":541.367,"stop":545.755,"duration":4.39},{"text":"A terminal company had acquired the stock of two competing companies that run terminal facilities and by that means, had obtained a stranglehold over all the terminal facilities in St. Louis.","start":545.755,"stop":557.83,"duration":12.08},{"text":"The Government in that case, asked for divestiture or dis -- dissolution.","start":557.83,"stop":562.974,"duration":5.14},{"text":"This Court decided that an alternative form of relief would be effective and more appropriate.","start":562.974,"stop":569.797,"duration":6.82},{"text":"Now, there is one significant thing I should like to add about that case.","start":569.797,"stop":573.659,"duration":3.86},{"text":"It was decided by a court of seven justices.","start":573.659,"stop":577.32,"duration":3.66},{"text":"Every one of those seven justices had sat and concurred in the opinions in the Tobacco and the Standard Oil case which had been divided -- decided about two years or a year before.","start":577.32,"stop":589.756,"duration":12.44},{"text":"Those are two other cases which appellant says, before the passage of the Clayton Act, laid down this rule that divestiture was mandatory whenever there was an unlawful acquisition of stock.","start":589.756,"stop":602.287,"duration":12.53},{"text":"Yet, in refusing to order divestiture in the terminal case, this -- not one of the seven justices appeared to recognize that rule.","start":602.287,"stop":612.278,"duration":9.99},{"text":"Indeed, in the very passage of the case or the opinion in which the Court discusses relief, the Court cited the Standard Oil case without any recognition explicit or -- or implicit, that that case laid down any rule and divestiture was mandatory in any particular kind of case.","start":612.278,"stop":635.449,"duration":23.17},{"text":"Now, the appellant -- I will say this.","start":635.449,"stop":639.354,"duration":3.91},{"text":"We have in our brief and in the interest of conserving time for the counsel for the other -- appellees here, I should like to rest on the brief on this point.","start":639.354,"stop":650.806,"duration":11.45},{"text":"We have cited in our brief, cases and instances of administrative practice since the passage of the Clayton Act which we think established that no court has ever held that divestiture is a mandatory remedy as a matter of law, under either the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act, without -- in any particular kind of case.","start":650.806,"stop":671.595,"duration":20.79},{"text":"Cases that hold that it's an appropriate remedy and it may be granted from cases hold in certain circumstances.","start":671.595,"stop":677.629,"duration":6.03},{"text":"It's the best remedy, those points aren't in dispute.","start":677.629,"stop":680.45,"duration":2.82},{"text":"But we submit that law shall -- that there is no rule, what it has meant or in a sense of -- that there is a rule that limits the equitable discretion of the Court.","start":680.45,"stop":691.148,"duration":10.7},{"text":"The appellant -- before I leave that point, I -- with diffidence again, I should like to refer the fact that in its prior opinion in this case, this Court said that the District Courts are closed with large discretion to mold their judgments to the exigency of a particular case.","start":691.148,"stop":717.479,"duration":26.33},{"text":"I don't want to argue that point.","start":717.479,"stop":718.891,"duration":1.41},{"text":"I just suggest that I find it difficult at least to reconcile appellant's argument with that statement.","start":718.891,"stop":727.274,"duration":8.38},{"text":"Appellant also relies on Section 11 of the Clayton Act.","start":727.274,"stop":734.942,"duration":7.67},{"text":"That is a section that has nothing to do with the District Courts or with their jurisdiction.","start":734.942,"stop":740.626,"duration":5.68},{"text":"It is a section that is confined entirely to the procedures to be followed by administrative agencies.","start":740.626,"stop":747.816,"duration":7.19},{"text":"We have discussed that Section in our brief and again, with the Court's permission, I should prefer rest on that discussion in the brief.","start":747.816,"stop":756.382,"duration":8.57},{"text":"We make essentially two points there.","start":756.382,"stop":759.132,"duration":2.75},{"text":"First that we think, the plaintiff or the appellant has misconstrued Section 11.","start":759.132,"stop":763.675,"duration":4.54},{"text":"But even in administrative proceedings, divestiture is not always a mandatory remedy and we point out the two agencies who have important responsibilities under that -- under Section 11, the Federal Trade Commission and the ICC have in the past, in our judgment, not construed it in that way.","start":763.675,"stop":782.535,"duration":18.86},{"text":"We say in second place that even if you assume it is mandatory in those proceedings which have brought before administrative agency, it does not follow that the Section imposes any comparable limitation on historic equity powers of the District Courts.","start":782.535,"stop":799.985,"duration":17.45},{"text":"And we have cited authorities which we think support that argument.","start":799.985,"stop":803.926,"duration":3.94},{"text":"And I should therefore, like to leave the question of Section 11 submitted on our brief.","start":803.926,"stop":811.973,"duration":8.05},{"text":"At points in appellant's argument, it seems to retreat from the position that divestiture is always mandatory as a matter of law.","start":811.973,"stop":821.626,"duration":9.65},{"text":"And to argue rather that it should be and must be applied in this case, because it is customary or usual.","start":821.626,"stop":830.406,"duration":8.78},{"text":"Now, I should just like to say this about that argument.","start":830.406,"stop":834.956,"duration":4.55},{"text":"It seems to me that an argument that any particular remedy must be applied in a particular case, because it has been customary or usual, is an argument that is inconsistent with the basic notion of equity jurisdiction.","start":834.956,"stop":852.486,"duration":17.53},{"text":"Equity judgments are not standardized.","start":852.486,"stop":858.97,"duration":6.48},{"text":"One of the justices of this Court in a dissenting opinion said that an equity decree is not like a standardized product or the packaged goods that are produced in this machinery.","start":858.97,"stop":872.892,"duration":13.92},{"text":"They have one thing in common.","start":872.892,"stop":877.154,"duration":4.26},{"text":"And that is that each one is molded to fit the facts of the particular case.","start":877.154,"stop":883.22,"duration":6.07},{"text":"We therefore suggested as a matter of law, jurisdiction of the discretion of a federal court seeking inequity is not controlled or limited by any rule of law that is founded in custom or habit or practice.","start":883.22,"stop":900.567,"duration":17.35},{"text":"The situation has to be judged and the remedy applied and devised from the light of facts in the particular case.","start":900.567,"stop":909.894,"duration":9.33},{"text":"Now, that brings me to the question of what the consequences would be in this case if plaintiffs demand -- or appellants demand for divestiture should be granted.","start":909.894,"stop":925.531,"duration":15.64},{"text":"And I should like to be clear that I have put that question in the proper context for this Court.","start":925.531,"stop":932.816,"duration":7.29},{"text":"The District Court did not act on the assumption that it should grant ineffective relief in order to protect the stockholders and we are not arguing that.","start":932.816,"stop":942.524,"duration":9.71},{"text":"The District Court recognized that its primary duty was to formulate a judgment complied with the mandate of this Court and remove the probability that was offensive to Section 7 of the Clayton Act.","start":942.524,"stop":956.205,"duration":13.68},{"text":"And that is what in our opinion, the District Court did.","start":956.205,"stop":960.462,"duration":4.26},{"text":"Now, the District Court did say that in choosing between effective remedies, it thought, it was entitled to take into consideration the effect that one remedy as opposed to another, might add upon the interest of the stockholder.","start":960.462,"stop":975.52,"duration":15.06},{"text":"There are substantially more than a million beneficial owners of stock in these two corporations.","start":975.52,"stop":981.735,"duration":6.22},{"text":"And -- include men and women and all walks and ranges of life, variety of institutions, investment trust, insurance companies, charities, hospitals, universities, we submit that it was a proper exercise of equity jurisdiction for the Court to take their interest into account.","start":981.735,"stop":1001.72,"duration":19.99},{"text":"Now, as I understand appellant's argument, it does not seriously deny that divestiture will inflict some inquiry on stockholders, but it says that some cases, it's irrelevant or in other cases, it is not -- and this is appellant's word, undue and yesterday, it argued that it would only be immediate or short ranged.","start":1001.72,"stop":1023.298,"duration":21.58},{"text":"It wouldn't over a long historical view, be very serious.","start":1023.298,"stop":1029.699,"duration":6.4},{"text":"I should like to suggest the Court that since this judgment is an effective judgment, it is really not necessary to assess or try to appraise the exact quantum, the injury that maybe inflicted by divestiture.","start":1029.699,"stop":1046.435,"duration":16.74},{"text":"If the judgment is effective and we say it is, then any injury whether it's immediate or long term or whether it's moderate or large, seems to us, unnecessary.","start":1046.435,"stop":1058.752,"duration":12.32},{"text":"I -- I think, I should make it clear to the Court that I am not arguing in quite the mellow dramatic term suggested by counsel that disaster will follow if divestiture is ordered.","start":1058.752,"stop":1069.692,"duration":10.94},{"text":"We are suggesting that if divestiture is ordered, the stockholders of these companies will suffer the serious injury.","start":1069.692,"stop":1079.443,"duration":9.75},{"text":"And I -- I suppose it's unnecessary, but I -- I should like to show the Court that I am not engaged in projected terrorize to frighten this Court.","start":1079.443,"stop":1088.741,"duration":9.3},{"text":"I have no confidence in my capacity to do that even if I were of a mind to do it.","start":1088.741,"stop":1094.312,"duration":5.57},{"text":"But, we were before -- we are before a court of equity and we assume that it's proper for us to invite the Court's attention to what the consequences of one form of relief maybe as against another.","start":1094.312,"stop":1106.608,"duration":12.3},{"text":"And that's what we did in the District Court and that's what we are doing here.","start":1106.608,"stop":1113.105,"duration":6.5},{"text":"Now, that brings me to how this divestiture that appellant is -- wants, could be accomplished.","start":1113.105,"stop":1120.311,"duration":7.21},{"text":"In our judgment, there are only two ways which it could be done.","start":1120.311,"stop":1123.651,"duration":3.34},{"text":"One would be to sell the stock, the other would be to distribute the stock as dividends to shareholders of du Pont Company.","start":1123.651,"stop":1134.241,"duration":10.59},{"text":"In this Court for the first time, appellant has suggested that perhaps the stock could be divested by exchanges and I hope that I shall have time to explain to the Court why that is not a feasible method of divestiture.","start":1134.241,"stop":1147.534,"duration":13.29},{"text":"I should say that in the District Court it seems to me, appellant recognized that the only two methods of divestiture that are really possible were sales or distributions of dividends.","start":1147.534,"stop":1160.185,"duration":12.65},{"text":"It brought into the District Court and defended their specific plan that provided for divestiture by sales and distribution.","start":1160.185,"stop":1169.02,"duration":8.84},{"text":"It appears now, it will abandon that plan or at least, not to the insisting upon it.","start":1169.02,"stop":1173.906,"duration":4.89},{"text":"But, I think at least then it recognized what we think is true that those are the two ways that will have to be employed.","start":1173.906,"stop":1181.208,"duration":7.3},{"text":"Now, as to sale, this stock has a present market value of 65 million shares, of about two and a half billion dollars.","start":1181.208,"stop":1191.95,"duration":10.74},{"text":"The forced sale of that stock or at any substantial part in a 10-year period as appellant insist in gradable amounts each year during that period, will the evidence establishes, have a substantially depressing effect upon the market price of General Motors.","start":1191.95,"stop":1211.42,"duration":19.47},{"text":"And that's in effect that will be felt by all the more than 700,000 shareholders of General Motors, because any shareholder who has to sell in that time will suffer the effects of this depression.","start":1211.42,"stop":1223.605,"duration":12.18},{"text":"Counsel for General Motors is going to discuss the market in fact of sales and I therefore, I'm not going to -- to say anything more about that.","start":1223.605,"stop":1235.606,"duration":12},{"text":"There is one other thing, however, that I should like to say about the sales.","start":1235.606,"stop":1239.043,"duration":3.44},{"text":"Of course that is this, to the extent that sales are ordered, a capital gains tax will be imposed on those sales.","start":1239.043,"stop":1248.14,"duration":9.1},{"text":"If you sold all of the 65 million shares, the capital gains tax would be about $600,000,000.","start":1248.14,"stop":1254.69,"duration":6.55},{"text":"To sell half of them, it would be about $300,000,000.","start":1254.69,"stop":1258.572,"duration":3.88},{"text":"Now, there's nothing wrong with the imposition of a capital gains tax when a taxpayer voluntarily decides to sell property on which he has a profit in order to get his proceeds, reinvest them in something else.","start":1258.572,"stop":1270.687,"duration":12.12},{"text":"But this is a forced sale and our judgment an unnecessary sale because it isn't required for effective relief.","start":1270.687,"stop":1279.276,"duration":8.59},{"text":"The counsel for appellant yesterday referred that the Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Company case, that was the case in which the District Court refused to order dissolution of the company when it found that other relief was effective because he thought the dissolution was unnecessary and it would impose the same capital gains

that if in the future, Chevrolet, for example, should decide to stop buying paint from du Pont.","start":4542.096,"stop":4551.838,"duration":9.74},{"text":"And again, buying paint from General Motors, these 200,000 shareholders of the du Pont Company or all the shareholders of du Pont Company would stop buying Chevrolet cars because they were annoyed by the change of the paint's suppliers.","start":4551.838,"stop":4572.585,"duration":20.75},{"text":"Now, I'm not sure how much I should say about that argument.","start":4572.585,"stop":4575.815,"duration":3.23},{"text":"It -- it seems to me to assume or rather extraordinary situation or make extraordinary assumptions about the buying habits of the American

this.","start":4585.83,"stop":4590.129,"duration":4.3},{"text":"Chevrolet salesman goes around to a prospective customer and says, \"I would like to sell you a

is a separate argument on this financial interest point.","start":4691.934,"stop":4696.241,"duration":4.31},{"text":"Appellant says, \"And it is wholly possible for du Pont without overt action to exert considerable pressure through its other business and financial connections.\"","start":4696.241,"stop":4708.935,"duration":12.69},{"text":"I take it that was the same argument that was being

comments.","start":4716.051,"stop":4717.582,"duration":1.53},{"text":"I think they are very important about that argument.","start":4717.582,"stop":4721.291,"duration":3.71},{"text":"The motive for du Pont to do anything of that kind is, of course, a desire to increase the volume of what it sells to General Motors.","start":4721.291,"stop":4731.263,"duration":9.97},{"text":"Now, that motive will remain even if you have complete divestiture of the legal title.","start":4731.263,"stop":4737.028,"duration":5.77},{"text":"So that by divesting yourself of the legal -- du Pont of the legal title, it does not remove the motive.","start":4737.028,"stop":4744.651,"duration":7.62},{"text":"The other comment I should like to make is, that these connections, as to which there is no evidence in the record, but these connections would exist whether you divest it to legal title or not.","start":4744.651,"stop":4758.457,"duration":13.81},{"text":"Precisely the same situation would exist.","start":4758.457,"stop":4760.856,"duration":2.4},{"text":"You would have the motive, what the mystery story writers call \"the opportunity\".","start":4760.856,"stop":4767.097,"duration":6.24},{"text":"And you can't change that by divesting the legal title.","start":4767.097,"stop":4770.313,"duration":3.22},{"text":"So on that point, appellant's proposals are no wit nor sufficient than ours.","start":4770.313,"stop":4776.307,"duration":5.99},{"text":"That comment, I think, applies also to appellant's argument that simply because of buying habits or custom or old acquaintance, the purchasing agents will keep on dealing with people from du Pont.","start":4776.307,"stop":4789.791,"duration":13.48},{"text":"I don't know whether that's true or not.","start":4789.791,"stop":4791.449,"duration":1.66},{"text":"I doubt whether it have a \"quantship\" quite that strong in the business where a cost is so important.","start":4791.449,"stop":4798.587,"duration":7.14},{"text":"But assume it is.","start":4798.587,"stop":4800.827,"duration":2.24},{"text":"You can't change that by divesting the legal title.","start":4800.827,"stop":4804.964,"duration":4.14},{"text":"Those are -- are parallels or imaginary dangerous which are not touched by appellant's proposal.","start":4804.964,"stop":4810.76,"duration":5.8},{"text":"In our judgment, they do not justify appellant's demand for complete divestiture of the legal type.","start":4810.76,"stop":4820.945,"duration":10.18},{"text":"Appellant has made another argument in its brief, which it has not made this afternoon here, and for that reason I'm not -- I'm trying not to say very much about it, but I think I should mention it, and that is that even if you assume that this judgement is completely affected to prevent General Motors from favoring du Pont, it isn't effective to prevent du Pont from favoring General Motors.","start":4820.945,"stop":4853.833,"duration":32.89},{"text":"That is an argument which turns this case upside down.","start":4853.833,"stop":4859.117,"duration":5.28},{"text":"The appellant prevailed in this Court before on the argument that the vice in this situation was that by reason of the stock ownership, du Pont was in a position where it could preempt the market represented by General Motors' purchasers to its own advantage and to the detriment of its competitors.","start":4859.117,"stop":4882.411,"duration":23.29},{"text":"This other argument, as I say, is an argument that reversed its answer.","start":4882.411,"stop":4886.241,"duration":3.83},{"text":"It says that the danger is not bad at all.","start":4886.241,"stop":4888.883,"duration":2.64},{"text":"The danger is that du Pont,

operates.","start":4888.883,"stop":4905.757,"duration":16.87},{"text":"I should like to make these comments about that argument.","start":4905.757,"stop":4908.704,"duration":2.95},{"text":"In the first place, there is no adjudication in this case by this Court or by the District Court which would make it permissible in our view for the Court to grant divestiture on any such basis as that.","start":4908.704,"stop":4921.452,"duration":12.75},{"text":"Certainly the fear that General -- du Pont would give General Motors some advantages, which would now allow General Motors to monopolize some market, was not a probability adjudicated by this Court in its -- on the merits.","start":4921.452,"stop":4935.843,"duration":14.39},{"text":"The second, there are no findings, there are no evidence.","start":4935.843,"stop":4939.13,"duration":3.29},{"text":"Such evidence, as there is, is directly contrary to this argument.","start":4939.13,"stop":4944.054,"duration":4.92},{"text":"There is -- there are evidences -- it's for the meager evidence because this issue was never tried.","start":4944.054,"stop":4948.365,"duration":4.31},{"text":"There are three instances in the record where du Pont developed an extraordinary and remarkable product which it given the General Motors on exclusive basis with no doubt has given an -- an advantage.","start":4948.365,"stop":4960.884,"duration":12.52},{"text":"That didn't happen in those cases.","start":4960.884,"stop":4963.078,"duration":2.19},{"text":"Duco is the most striking one because there, General Motors asked for the exclusive right to use it and was refused.","start":4963.078,"stop":4971.581,"duration":8.5},{"text":"The fact is that on -- in economic terms, taking into account the amount of sales of -- to General Motors in relation to du Pont's total sales, it would not, I think, ever be du Pont's advantage to do anything of that kind.","start":4971.581,"stop":4986.573,"duration":14.99},{"text":"But beyond that, I should like to leave the
