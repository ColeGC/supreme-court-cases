affirmed.","start":70.223,"stop":73.543,"duration":3.32},{"text":"And as before stated, you granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, remanded the case for further consideration in the light of your Twin City decision the week before.","start":73.543,"stop":87.994,"duration":14.45},{"text":"On remand, the Court of Appeals was constrained to recognize that under the Twin City decision, there could be no recovery against the United States or rights which would have value only in connection with the development of the water power of a navigable stream.","start":87.994,"stop":110.616,"duration":22.62},{"text":"But in returning the case to the District Court, the Court of Appeals directed that there'd be an award to the power company of compensation for the taking of the Government's easement.","start":110.616,"stop":127.133,"duration":16.52},{"text":"Excluding from the valuation, any element of value arising from the availability, these are its words, \"of the land for water power purposes due to it's being situate on a navigable stream, but including,\" and I resume, \"other elements of value not related to the flow of the stream such as its value for agricultural or grazing purposes\".","start":127.133,"stop":160.122,"duration":32.99},{"text":"Along the return of the case to the District Court, the Commissioners were appointed under Rule 71A (h) and were instructed to return their answers to four specific questions insisting on its position that the power company's flowage easements could have no possible value as against the United States.","start":160.122,"stop":185.365,"duration":25.24},{"text":"The Government again offered no valuation evidence at the retrial before the Commissioners in June of 1958.","start":185.365,"stop":193.57,"duration":8.2},{"text":"And after a further hearing before the Court, the District Court that is, in November of 1958, the Court entered judgment against the United States in favor of the power company, this time for $65,520 plus interest.","start":193.57,"stop":212.667,"duration":19.1},{"text":"In doing this, the Court held that the second of its inquiries to the Commissioners was and I quote, \"the appropriate measure of value or compensation\" is the word.","start":212.667,"stop":225.707,"duration":13.04},{"text":"That second inquiry had directed the Commission to determine the difference between the fair market value of this Falkland Estate that belonged to Mrs. Williams.","start":225.707,"stop":239.59,"duration":13.88},{"text":"The tract of 7400 acres with and without the servitude of the Government's easement, except that it would assume for that purpose that the easement, the Government's easement covered only the 1540 acres covered by VEPCO's easement up to contour 321 instead of 330 and excluding from both of such valuations any element of value arising from the availability of such land for water power development purposes due to it's being situate riparian to a navigable stream.","start":239.59,"stop":284.737,"duration":45.15},{"text":"And in making their report, the Commissioners stated that $11,720 of the total difference of $65,520 represented \"damages to the residue\" of the Falkland Estate.","start":284.737,"stop":307.337,"duration":22.6},{"text":"Well, the Government again appeals.","start":307.337,"stop":310.592,"duration":3.25},{"text":"The Court of Appeals again affirmed.","start":310.592,"stop":313.077,"duration":2.49},{"text":"And at that point, you have brought the case here.","start":313.077,"stop":316.932,"duration":3.86},{"text":"On these facts, we think that the courts below have persisted in trying the wrong case.","start":316.932,"stop":325.188,"duration":8.26},{"text":"And we are here in an effort to get the right case at long last decided.","start":325.188,"stop":331.786,"duration":6.6},{"text":"In the Government's view, there is a very simple syllogism which requires a conclusion favorable to the Government against the power company.","start":331.786,"stop":342.872,"duration":11.09},{"text":"The major premise of this syllogism is based upon your decision in the Twin City case that when the Government, in the exercise of its commerce power, appropriates the flow of a navigable stream for a government project, it is not obligated to pay those elements of property value which are solely dependent upon the flow of the navigable stream.","start":342.872,"stop":368.099,"duration":25.23},{"text":"And the minor premise of the syllogism is bottomed upon such cases as Boston Chamber of Commerce against Boston, Messer against United States, the Southern California Fishermen's Association case, United States against Petty Motors that where the United States settles with the owner of one interest in property, the question of compensation for all interests is irrelevant and only the question of just compensation for the interest taken concerns the Government.","start":368.099,"stop":406.151,"duration":38.05},{"text":"Now, I'll come back to that minor premise for a little further development in a little bit.","start":406.151,"stop":411.008,"duration":4.86},{"text":"But I want to deal first with this major premise based on Twin City, currently very much dispute about it.","start":411.008,"stop":419.274,"duration":8.27},{"text":"This case, like Twin City and Chandler-Dunbar is one in which the United States has chosen to exercise its commerce power to the fullest extent in the building of this project.","start":419.274,"stop":434.377,"duration":15.1},{"text":"Indeed, the project, as I have previously noted, and the Twin City Project were adopted, authorized and constructed under the very same authorizing Act of Congress.","start":434.377,"stop":448.351,"duration":13.97},{"text":"Here, for the same reasons and to the same extent to paraphrase your language in Twin City, the United States has displaced all competing interests and has appropriated the entire flow of the river at this point to the declared public purpose.","start":448.351,"stop":466.882,"duration":18.53},{"text":"And for the same reasons, this is not such a situation as those involved in the Gerlach Livestock Company case or the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation case where the action of Congress, as you have said, fell short of a full exercise of its constitutional power to appropriate the flow of the river to the public domain so that prior rights existing under state law were in those cases, Gerlach and Niagara Mohawk held compensable or otherwise recognized.","start":466.882,"stop":503.509,"duration":36.63},{"text":"Now, by even the stronger reason, we can put aside, as you did in Twin City, such other cases as United States against Kansas City Life upon which the respondent seems so strongly to rely.","start":503.509,"stop":520.03,"duration":16.52},{"text":"The basic lesson to be learned from Twin City is that when the Government exercises its commerce power to the fullest extent without any qualifications, competing interests are displaced without compensation being required under the Fifth Amendment to the extent, and I agree only to the extent, that those interests have a value which is dependent, necessarily and solely upon the flow of the navigable stream, a value which the Government can either grant or withhold as it chooses.","start":520.03,"stop":558.539,"duration":38.51},{"text":"And as you have so recently as last June in the Grand River Dam case said that if the Government does not grant it, it is beholden to no one.","start":558.539,"stop":569,"duration":10.46},{"text":"Now, that has been the Government's major premise in this case from the very beginning long before Twin City, long before Grand River as may be seen from the Government's original trial brief.","start":569,"stop":582.785,"duration":13.78},{"text":"In 1953, which VEPCO has done us the favor of inserting in its appendix, page 214 and following of the record, \"VEPCO counsel has through the years indulged in much talked about the Government changing its position.\"","start":582.785,"stop":601.405,"duration":18.62},{"text":"Well, let the record speak for itself.","start":601.405,"stop":605.021,"duration":3.62},{"text":"In that context, however, it may be appropriate for me to point out that VEPCO's original answer to interrogatories Record 22.","start":605.021,"stop":616.166,"duration":11.15},{"text":"It claimed compensation measured by the value of its flowage easement \"for water power development purposes\" and no other.","start":616.166,"stop":628.347,"duration":12.18},{"text":"Under the stress of your remand of the case in early 1956 for reconsideration in the light of Twin City, VEPCO, of course, had to find a new theory.","start":628.347,"stop":643.262,"duration":14.91},{"text":"A theory which we insist still gives its something for nothing.","start":643.262,"stop":648.834,"duration":5.57},{"text":"Obedient to your decision in Twin City, the Court of Appeals on remand held of course that VEPCO was not entitled to values inherent in the flow of the stream.","start":648.834,"stop":660.403,"duration":11.57},{"text":"And I do not understand that VEPCO is now claiming such values or could.","start":660.403,"stop":666.776,"duration":6.37},{"text":"So, while the Government's major premise is by no means to be lost sight of, I would take it that the premise is now conceded by both VEPCO and the Court of Appeals.","start":666.776,"stop":677.449,"duration":10.67},{"text":"Now, at the outset of the Government's second point, its minor premise so to speak, I ask you to examine what it was that VEPCO had.","start":677.449,"stop":690.189,"duration":12.74},{"text":"The Government has never contested that VEPCO once had certain rights against the fee owner.","start":690.189,"stop":700.528,"duration":10.34},{"text":"In the first place, it once had rights as against the fee owner.","start":700.528,"stop":707.631,"duration":7.1},{"text":"Originating in the year 1907, this is a paraphrase of the language of its basic instruments, “To construct and maintain a dam in the Dan River and thereby to raise the water level at the head of Hyco Falls six feet above normal.","start":707.631,"stop":726.421,"duration":18.79},{"text":"In the second place, it once had rights as against the fee owner originating this time in 1925 to build, I'm quoting now excerpts, \"To build, to rebuild and again to build any dam or dams it might desire across the Dan River,\" so that the normal water level behind said dam shall not be higher than what the Government concedes here to be contour 321, resume quote, \"together with all riparian rights, water rights, easements and rights of floodage related to the building of such dam on the so-called Falkland Estate,\" which estate released VEPCO's predecessor from any damages for, and I again resume quote, \"anything done within the limits of its rights aforesaid in the development of the water power aforesaid\".","start":726.421,"stop":791.161,"duration":64.74},{"text":"In other words, the very documents upon which VEPCO rests and indeed must rest its claim of interest.","start":791.161,"stop":803.637,"duration":12.48},{"text":"And I would remind you that it has the burden of proving its interest show explicitly that the only easement rights which it possessed as against the owner of the fee simple title, were the very rights, which it could not lawfully exercise without the formal consent of the United States and that the prospect of any such consent ever being given vanished, disappeared, expired, terminated.","start":803.637,"stop":835.682,"duration":32.05},{"text":"As early as 1944, this case was brought in 1952, as early as 1944 when the United States decided to build its own project at this location on its own account.","start":835.682,"stop":852.639,"duration":16.96},{"text":"Now

Morton","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, yes, sir.","start":854.799,"stop":858.964,"duration":4.17},{"text":"There has never been any question in this case that Mrs. Williams held a fee simple title to the so-called Falkland Estate at the time of the commencement of this case.","start":858.964,"stop":871.86,"duration":12.9},{"text":"And as far as I know, she still owns that fee title.","start":871.86,"stop":876.12,"duration":4.26},{"text":"The Government took only a flowage easement on that estate in strictest accord with the option agreement previously negotiated with Mrs. Williams at her own urgent request and Mrs. Williams is fully satisfied with that settlement and is honorably and consistently claiming no further or different compensation.","start":876.12,"stop":899.405,"duration":23.28},{"text":"I insist that this respondent power company, which once had only a flowage easement for power purposes on 1540 acres of the 1840 acres covered by the Government's easement had and has no right whatever as a matter of fact or law to question the settlement arrangement between Mrs. Williams and the Government for that is precisely none of its business.","start":899.405,"stop":927.855,"duration":28.45},{"text":"Now, as already noted, the situation in this case differs from Twin City in respect to the fact that in Twin City, the company owned in fee simple the bulk of the land which the Government condemned in fee.","start":927.855,"stop":944.784,"duration":16.93},{"text":"Twin City was therefore entitled to compensation for any other elements of value, agricultural values, timber, forestry, anything else, any other elements of value.","start":944.784,"stop":956.141,"duration":11.36},{"text":"It could prove within the rules for determining just compensation excluding power site value.","start":956.141,"stop":964.58,"duration":8.44},{"text":"The Government does not contend that the fee owner is not entitled to such other values according to the usual rules.","start":964.58,"stop":974.052,"duration":9.47},{"text":"If we had not settled with Mrs. Williams in this case, on the basis entirely satisfactory to her, we would long since have tried the issue of just compensation with her.","start":974.052,"stop":985.069,"duration":11.02},{"text":"But that is not this case and no amount of the confusion with which the case seems to be beset can make it so.","start":985.069,"stop":995.067,"duration":10},{"text":"Power rights which Mrs. Williams would have had to compensation in the absence of a settlement can somehow now rub off on VEPCO involves a process of osmosis or alchemy, which I utterly fail to understand.","start":995.067,"stop":1015.061,"duration":19.99},{"text":"And yet that, in its simplest terms, is the basis on which the case has been tried ever since you vacated the prior judgment and remanded the case in 1956.","start":1015.061,"stop":1027.262,"duration":12.2},{"text":"Now, VEPCO says that a condemnation is a proceeding in rem and we wholeheartedly agree.","start":1027.262,"stop":1037.607,"duration":10.35},{"text":"We insist that the only raise involved in this controversy is the flowage easement which VEPCO held.","start":1037.607,"stop":1047.803,"duration":10.2},{"text":"VEPCO says that just compensation is to be fixed without regard to the various interests in land and that the Government is not concerned with distribution.","start":1047.803,"stop":1058.891,"duration":11.09},{"text":"And again, this unit rule is the general rule and we readily concede it.","start":1058.891,"stop":1065.648,"duration":6.76},{"text":"In fact, the Government is first -- is the first to champion this rule when it applies.","start":1065.648,"stop":1071.915,"duration":6.27},{"text":"We go straight down the line with the great mass of cases in the respondent's brief in support of this proposition, the unit rule.","start":1071.915,"stop":1083.986,"duration":12.07},{"text":"We insist, however, that the unit principle does not apply when the unit no longer exists as when the parties themselves have destroyed the unit, as they did in the Boston Chamber of Commerce case or when the Government has already settled with the owner of one interest as it did in the Petty Motor, the Messer, the Southern California Fishermen's and so on cases.","start":1083.986,"stop":1108.588,"duration":24.6},{"text":"In the Boston case, you long ago held, it was Mr. Justice Holmes I believe in 1910 that the Fifth Amendment and I quote, \"does not require a disregard of the mode of ownership of the state of the title\".","start":1108.588,"stop":1125.329,"duration":16.74},{"text":"It does not require that a parcel of land be valued as an unencumbered whole when it is not held as an unencumbered whole.","start":1125.329,"stop":1133.891,"duration":8.56},{"text":"It merely requires that an owner of property taken should be paid for what has been taken from him.","start":1133.891,"stop":1142.93,"duration":9.04},{"text":"And the Messer case, in the Fifth Circuit on the authority of your Petty Motor decision and I might insert that the Southern California Fishermen's case at Long Beach was almost exactly the same as the Messer case.","start":1142.93,"stop":1156.822,"duration":13.89},{"text":"The Messer case said very pertinently that, \"Whereas here, the Government settles with the owner of one interest the question of compensation for all interests is irrelevant and the only -- only the question of just compensation for the interest taken concerns the Government.\"","start":1156.822,"stop":1178.166,"duration":21.34},{"text":"Now, this exception to the general rule, I want to note, rests upon very sound public policy, the policy of encouraging settlements wherever possible and narrowing controversies to their minimum number and limits.","start":1178.166,"stop":1196.419,"duration":18.25},{"text":"Multiple hundreds of such partial settlements are made every year.","start":1196.419,"stop":1201.682,"duration":5.26},{"text":"I know because for seven and a half years, I have had a hand in approving them.","start":1201.682,"stop":1207.019,"duration":5.34},{"text":"Do you think that such settlements would be made if this sound exception to the unit rule did not protect the Government from paying twice for the same thing?","start":1207.019,"stop":1218.84,"duration":11.82},{"text":"Of course, they would not be made.","start":1218.84,"stop":1222.745,"duration":3.9},{"text":"And finally, and very subordinately, I mentioned briefly the second heading of the Government's argument which has to do with the
