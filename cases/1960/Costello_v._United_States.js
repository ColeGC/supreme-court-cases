of the intention to apply for citizenship in March of 1923 and filed a preliminary form of application in May of 1925, an application for citizenship in September of 1925 and was granted citizenship at that time.","start":43.294,"stop":74.195,"duration":30.9},{"text":"Suit was instituted under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in May of 1958.","start":74.195,"stop":87.3,"duration":13.11},{"text":"There were a number of grounds alleged for the revocation, cancellation of citizenship but the one that is germane on this petition is that the petitioner is alleged to have willfully misrepresented his occupation in his preliminary form of application and in his application for citizenship in that he stated that his occupation was real estate when in fact the Government contends he was a bootlegger.","start":87.3,"stop":130.336,"duration":43.04},{"text":"Now, the trial judge entered an order revoking citizenship on two

grounds were that there was a willful misrepresentation of occupation.","start":145.765,"stop":153.351,"duration":7.59},{"text":"And secondly, a willful misrepresentation when petitioner swore that he

theory that he didn't love the Constitution that he didn't love all of it and the Eighteenth Amendment was a part of it and that there was certainly a mental reservation with respect to that part of it when he swore allegiance to the United States.","start":170.516,"stop":185.594,"duration":15.08},{"text":"That contention, Mr. Justice Stewart, was rejected by the Circuit Court on the ground that the swearing to support the Constitution of the United States really is a foreswearing of allegiance to the fatherland and a swearing of allegiance to the ideological concept of the democratic system and that it does not require embracing all the individual parts of the Constitution.","start":185.594,"stop":216.141,"duration":30.55},{"text":"There was no allegation that he misrepresented the fact when he said he was attached to the principles of the Constitution and so that second ground was rejected by the Court of Appeals leaving only one ground as the predicate for denaturalization as the case comes to this Court in its present posture.","start":216.141,"stop":238.094,"duration":21.95},{"text":"Now, it's our contention, if the Court please, that there is not evidence to support the finding that there was a willful misrepresentation of the fact with respect to this petitioner's occupation at the time the representation was made in 1925.","start":238.094,"stop":263.884,"duration":25.79},{"text":"The evidence in the trial court shows through an immigration and naturalization inspector who was offered by the Government as a

boroughs of New York, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx and Richmond.","start":500.035,"stop":524.169,"duration":24.13},{"text":"Brooklyn.","start":524.169,"stop":524.878,"duration":0.71},{"text":"Thank you.","start":524.878,"stop":526.24,"duration":1.36},{"text":"There were only four boroughs wherein an investigation was made, although the corporation charter specifically gave authorization to do business throughout New York State and elsewhere.","start":526.24,"stop":541.221,"duration":14.98},{"text":"Over and above this, the record shows that lots were purchased by this corporation in August of 1925 -- on August 12, 1925 in the Bronx.","start":541.221,"stop":555.011,"duration":13.79},{"text":"They were sold the next year to the Rosenblum Realty Corporation on June 22 of 1926.","start":555.011,"stop":563.695,"duration":8.68},{"text":"The record also shows a very substantial real estate transaction entered into by this corporation of which the petitioner was president.","start":563.695,"stop":575.082,"duration":11.39},{"text":"In October of 1925, when several pieces of ground at Nelson Avenue in the Bronx were acquired, there was a purchase-money mortgage of $70,000 on this property.","start":575.082,"stop":589.059,"duration":13.98},{"text":"And within six months, this property was sold with a purchase-money mortgage of $310,000 on it with buildings having been erected on it and the sale was consummated subject to leasings and tenancies then in existence demonstrating that substantial buildings had been put up in 1925, sold in 1926 with leasings and tenancies, carrying a mortgage money of $300,000 by the corporation of which this man was the president.","start":589.059,"stop":627.24,"duration":38.18},{"text":"The record further shows that there were two other corporations, the Babylon Waterfront Company and White Homes Incorporated both of which charters were issued for real estate operations, one in January 26, and the other in July of 1926.","start":627.24,"stop":644.35,"duration":17.11},{"text":"I think it's one of the verities of life that one does not become active of record in the real estate business until a certain passage of time takes place.","start":644.35,"stop":656.552,"duration":12.2},{"text":"There is a record here that that from the four boroughs which were examined for the years in question, these transactions took place at this time and that there was a profit made by the petitioner of $25,000.","start":656.552,"stop":670.532,"duration":13.98},{"text":"Now, the record also shows that during the 13 years between 1919 and 1932, the petitioner had income of $305,000.","start":670.532,"stop":689.225,"duration":18.69},{"text":"That's significant for these reasons.","start":689.225,"stop":692.931,"duration":3.71},{"text":"The income is specifically delineated in the record for the years 1927, 1929 and 1930, namely that he had income in those three years of $134,000 leaving $171,000 of income to be distributed over the remaining 10 years, which would give a mean average of about $17,000.","start":692.931,"stop":717.878,"duration":24.95},{"text":"Now, I say vis-à-vis the profit that was made in the real estate transaction of 1925 on the sale of the apartments at West End Avenue and 92nd Street, it can be seen that the $25,000 income constituted not merely a substantial part of the income for that year derived at from a mean average but the major part of petitioner's income for that year.","start":717.878,"stop":745.822,"duration":27.94},{"text":"Now, this $305,000 figure was a figure arrived at with the Bureau of Internal Revenue in a settlement of tax liability for the 13 years in question.","start":745.822,"stop":758.139,"duration":12.32},{"text":"Now, if the Court please, if this case were here, not as a denaturalization case but as a perjury case, I think that it's fair to say that qualitatively, the evidence here would not support a perjury conviction.","start":758.139,"stop":785.665,"duration":27.53},{"text":"And I think the only difference between a perjury case on this answer and a denaturalization case is in the quantum of proof and the procedural requisites of proving perjury under the federal statute.","start":785.665,"stop":799.557,"duration":13.89},{"text":"But qualitatively, I don't think that the evidence supports the fact that this was a perjurious answer or a willfully false answer because in fact at the time that the representation was made by the petitioner, that he was in the real estate business, the record shows as adduced by the Government itself in this case in truth, in fact he was in the real estate business.","start":799.557,"stop":829.354,"duration":29.8},{"text":"Now, of course, the quantum of proof, as this Court has said on many occasions, is that evidence must be clear and convincing and unequivocal as stated in the Baumgartner and the Schneiderman case.","start":829.354,"stop":843.942,"duration":14.59},{"text":"Now, the Court has said in the Nowak and Maisenberg cases in 1958, that where the question is subject to an inference by the person interrogated and that the inference is reasonable and that he answers it truthfully on the inferential predicate that a denaturalization decree will not stand.","start":843.942,"stop":878.006,"duration":34.06},{"text":"In that case, there was a two-pronged question, \"Do you believe in anarchy?","start":878.006,"stop":884.544,"duration":6.54},{"text":"Do you belong to any organization or association which advocates anarchy or the overthrow of the United States Government?\"","start":884.544,"stop":895.078,"duration":10.53},{"text":"In those cases, the petitioner has answered in the negative.","start":895.078,"stop":898.955,"duration":3.88},{"text":"In each instance, they were members of the Communist Party at the time that they made these answers.","start":898.955,"stop":905.424,"duration":6.47},{"text":"And this Court said that those questions under the doctrine of the Houston (Inaudible) might conceivably have been interpreted by the person answering as calling for an answer dealing with belief in anarchy or the belonging to an organization advocating anarchy and that alone and therefore, in that frame, his answers could not be said to constitute a willful misrepresentation.","start":905.424,"stop":939.639,"duration":34.22},{"text":"Now, in this case, if the Court please, the Government conceded below and the Court of Appeals found that the question propounded was subject to the inference that it was calling for the petitioner's legitimate occupation.","start":939.639,"stop":963.444,"duration":23.8},{"text":"In the Government's position as enunciated in its printed brief below, it said, \"Surely, this question could have been construed as calling for the petitioner's legitimate occupation.\"","start":963.444,"stop":989.105,"duration":25.66},{"text":"He could have interpreted the question as calling for only legitimate occupations.","start":989.105,"stop":994.636,"duration":5.53},{"text":"And in the opinion of the Court of Appeals below, the Court said the very same thing.","start":994.636,"stop":1008.946,"duration":14.31},{"text":"At page 250 of the record where the opinion appeal -- appears, \"Surely, it's conceivable that an applicant might believe that the answer call for no more than a disclosure of some legal occupation.\"","start":1008.946,"stop":1028.594,"duration":19.65},{"text":"And if that concession is made and if that concession is found to be the fact by the lower court and if the record clearly shows that the petitioner was engaged in an occupation as a real estate operator, then I say, that it must follow inevitably that the decree of the lower court must fail.","start":1028.594,"stop":1059.092,"duration":30.5},{"text":"Now, how could this information concerning alleged criminal activity have been elicited from the petitioner?","start":1059.092,"stop":1068.109,"duration":9.02},{"text":"I say it could have been elicited in exactly the way that it's now elicited by the Immigration and Naturalization authorities.","start":1068.109,"stop":1080.461,"duration":12.35},{"text":"In the case of United States of America against Tooma which was decided only in October of this year by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.","start":1080.461,"stop":1096.213,"duration":15.75},{"text":"There is spelled out an exact quote from the application for naturalization as it exist today.","start":1096.213,"stop":1107.596,"duration":11.38},{"text":"And this is the way the information is elicited today which the Government says should have been elicited by virtue of the simple question, occupation, my present occupation is.","start":1107.596,"stop":1121.874,"duration":14.28},{"text":"It says, \"The law provides that no person shall be regarded as a person of good moral character who, during the period of residence required for naturalization is or was a habitual drunkard, has committed adultery, derived income principally from illegal gambling activities, has given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining any benefits under the immigration and naturalization laws, is or was a polygamist who practiced or advocated polygamy, is or was a prostitute or engaged in or received support of the proceeds from prostitution or procured, imported, or attempted to procure or import persons for prostitution or any other immoral purposes, or who came to the

acts?","start":1177.717,"stop":1191.002,"duration":13.28},{"text":"Now, if that question had been asked to the petitioner and if the evidence had showed that he was in fact, in 1925 or at any time theretofore, engaged in bootlegging and he'd answer to the negative, there would have been no question that this would have been a willfully false, materially false representation on which a denaturalization decree certainly might well have been predicated.","start":1191.002,"stop":1217.513,"duration":26.51}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Were there any questions

Justice, the only question on that score was, \"Have you ever been arrested?\"","start":1225.904,"stop":1235.608,"duration":9.7},{"text":"Now, in this case, there is no evidence that that question was ever asked of this petitioner and the Government failed in its proof below on that.","start":1235.608,"stop":1248.84,"duration":13.23},{"text":"Ordinarily, that information would appear on what is Government's Exhibit 8 which appears in the back of the record.","start":1248.84,"stop":1258.854,"duration":10.01},{"text":"This is called an admitted

score.","start":1292.466,"stop":1308.181,"duration":15.72},{"text":"So that -- or the -- the questions that were put can be found in the record, first of all, at page 200, question two, \"My present occupation is real estate.\"","start":1308.181,"stop":1328.226,"duration":20.05},{"text":"And then, the Government contends that at page 202, the typed in words \"Real Estate\" were an oral answer

instance.","start":1363.979,"stop":1381.255,"duration":17.28},{"text":"Now, secondly, the trial judge specifically refused to draw an inference from the fact that petitioner did not testify in this

Appeals, in its opinion, at page 208 of the record, has this to say, \"We think the District Court, though it did not do so, might properly have buttressed its findings by the unfavorable inferences

case in the Second Circuit and the (Inaudible) case here.","start":1443.04,"stop":1455.599,"duration":12.56},{"text":"Then, if the Court please, the Circuit Court went on to do precisely what the trial court had not done because in the record, at page 250, at the bottom of the third paragraph on that page, the Court says, \"If there was any further evidence along this line,\" meaning evidence of real estate operations, \"it would be peculiarly within the knowledge of Costello and his failure to produce evidence of such activity warrants the inference that there was none such.\"","start":1455.599,"stop":1492.425,"duration":36.83},{"text":"Now, that alone, I would not contend, was sufficient to say that the appellate court drew an inference against him from his failure

silence.","start":1524.719,"stop":1533.652,"duration":8.93},{"text":"And I say that the Government is spiked on the horns of a dilemma with respect to this proposition of law because either the law is that a defendant maybe called in a denaturalization proceeding to give evidence against himself or he may not.","start":1533.652,"stop":1555.679,"duration":22.03},{"text":"Either citizenship is one of those things protected within the purview of the Fifth Amendment or it is not.","start":1555.679,"stop":1564.167,"duration":8.49},{"text":"If it is, then he could not have been called and it likewise follows that no inference could have been drawn against him from his failure to testify.","start":1564.167,"stop":1575.485,"duration":11.32},{"text":"If it is not, then he was equally available to the

him.","start":1575.485,"stop":1590.05,"duration":14.57},{"text":"So that they are seeking to draw an inference from the failure to produce evidence which was equally available to the Government as it
