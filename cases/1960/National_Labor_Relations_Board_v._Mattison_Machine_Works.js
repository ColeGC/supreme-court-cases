the best way of avoiding industrial strike.","start":1043.086,"stop":1077.361,"duration":34.28},{"text":"Now, in the circumstances here, we submit that the Board was -- was clearly reasonable in

Board.","start":1077.361,"stop":1103.937,"duration":26.58},{"text":"Indeed as I pointed out, it did not even contend before the Board that this defect had any effect so far as confusing the employees.","start":1103.937,"stop":1118.161,"duration":14.22},{"text":"The confusion contention was first advanced in its brief in the Court of Appeals and the statement there set forth which is also

record support whatever.","start":1118.161,"stop":1150.679,"duration":32.52},{"text":"There's not anything in the record that would substantiate that speculation which respondent indulged in first in its brief in the court below and repeated in its brief to this Court.","start":1150.679,"stop":1167.915,"duration":17.24},{"text":"Finally, we submit that the alleged confusion over the two employees

was simply whether or not when they came up to get a ballot.","start":1183.974,"stop":1194.988,"duration":11.01},{"text":"The field examiner, the Board filed examiner told them that since they had

vote.","start":1194.988,"stop":1225.143,"duration":30.15},{"text":"Now, the Board did not resolve that conflict in testimony because it found it unnecessary to do so in view of the fact that even had
