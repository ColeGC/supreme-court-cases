Justices.","start":11.85,"stop":17.353,"duration":5.5},{"text":"We've had a somewhat unusual, I think, for the Court situation this afternoon in a situation of a petitioner speaking for himself.","start":17.353,"stop":31.147,"duration":13.79},{"text":"I think perhaps in the Konigsberg case, we come in to a second somewhat unusual situation in that we have a case here for the second time on at least what from the point of view of the petitioner would seem to us to be almost identical facts as have already been determined by this Court.","start":31.147,"stop":57.662,"duration":26.52},{"text":"I, of course, am well aware of the theory under which the State of California acting through the Committee of Bar Examiners has brought this case before you a second time by declining to admit the petitioner after the decision of this Court.","start":57.662,"stop":75.607,"duration":17.95},{"text":"So that I think that I should commence by reviewing the facts as they have occurred, bringing us down first to the present moment of this second Konigsberg case.","start":75.607,"stop":91.596,"duration":15.99},{"text":"The Court will remember that on May 6th, 1957, this Court said about the petitioner without some authentic reliable evidence of unlawful or immoral actions reflecting upon him, it is difficult to comprehend why the State rejected a man of Konigsberg's background and character as morally unfit to practice law.","start":91.596,"stop":118.359,"duration":26.76},{"text":"Now, in California, there are two statutes which come in to play in connection with admissions of -- of perspective applicants for the Bar.","start":118.359,"stop":129.226,"duration":10.87},{"text":"We have the business and professions called Section 6060 which simply, along with age and education requirements, establishes that a person must be of good moral character.","start":129.226,"stop":142.686,"duration":13.46},{"text":"And then we have Section 6064.1 which says that no person who advocates overthrow of the Government by force and violence maybe a member of the Bar.","start":142.686,"stop":155.552,"duration":12.87},{"text":"Now, as far as petitioner is concern, these are the only two statutes that are really involved in this case at the present time.","start":155.552,"stop":166.557,"duration":11},{"text":"Konigsberg comments the study of law in September of 1950 at the University of Southern California.","start":166.557,"stop":175.098,"duration":8.54},{"text":"He registered his intention to take the bar examination with the Committee of Bar Examiners in accordance with the normal procedures in December of 1950.","start":175.098,"stop":186.745,"duration":11.65},{"text":"His previous background was somewhat unusual for a law student in that he was already 39 years old had already had a distinguished career in social work in the community of Los Angeles and other parts of the country.","start":186.745,"stop":200.449,"duration":13.7},{"text":"He had a master's degree at Ohio State University.","start":200.449,"stop":203.882,"duration":3.43},{"text":"He had, at one time, been a supervisor in the Department of Health here in the District of Columbia.","start":203.882,"stop":210.063,"duration":6.18},{"text":"He had been director of Social Services for the City of Hope Sanatorium in Los Angeles.","start":210.063,"stop":214.978,"duration":4.92},{"text":"He had been a district director of relief in the State of California.","start":214.978,"stop":219.48,"duration":4.5},{"text":"During the war, he had spent some four years in the army and had come out with the rank of captain in the United States Army.","start":219.48,"stop":229.572,"duration":10.09},{"text":"Nevertheless, when the time came for him to take the bar examination, he was called in by the Committee Bar Examiners, which in California, under our integrated bar system, differing in that extent from Illinois, has the power to recommend to the Supreme Court but in California, the Supreme Court does the admitting of respective app -- applicants for the Bar.","start":229.572,"stop":256.944,"duration":27.37},{"text":"He was called then and certain hearings were conducted of which the record was before this Court in its entirety in the case which was decided in 1957.","start":256.944,"stop":270.051,"duration":13.11},{"text":"At the conclusion of the hearings in 1953 and 1954, the Supreme Court of California declined to review a determination by the Committee of Bar Examiners that the petitioner had not met his burden of proof that he was a person of good moral character or that he did not advocate overthrow of the Government by force and violence.","start":270.051,"stop":297.183,"duration":27.13},{"text":"The petition for review was made to the Supreme Court of California.","start":297.183,"stop":301.597,"duration":4.41},{"text":"And although three of the judges voted for a hearing, no hearing was held in the Supreme Court of California and the matter came to this Court on a petition for certiorari.","start":301.597,"stop":313.225,"duration":11.63},{"text":"The decision of this Court, of course, is 353 U.S. 252, the case of Konigsberg versus State Bar.","start":313.225,"stop":322.49,"duration":9.26},{"text":"Now, after the mandate from this Court came down to California, the petitioner, acting through counsel, requested the Supreme Court of California, which was not then in session, to set a time for hearing for the petitioner to be sworn in as a member of the Bar assuming that the -- that the opinion of this Court instructing the State of California to take action not inconsistent with the decision could only mean that petitioner should be admitted to the Bar.","start":322.49,"stop":354.919,"duration":32.43},{"text":"The considerable period of time passed in which the Supreme Court of California did not act and then finally, the Supreme Court vacated its previous orders in the matter and sent the matter to the Committee of Bar Examiners with instructions of the Committee of Bar Examiners should take action not inconsistent with the Supreme Court decision.","start":354.919,"stop":378.788,"duration":23.87},{"text":"At that time, the petitioner then requested of the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State of California that the Committee of Bar Examiners simply make a recommendation that petitioner be admitted to the Bar of the State of California.","start":378.788,"stop":393.546,"duration":14.76},{"text":"Instead, the Committee of Bar Examiners called further hearings and the record, which is before this Court in the present proceeding, consists of the hearing before the Committee of Bar Examiners.","start":393.546,"stop":408.128,"duration":14.58},{"text":"Now, when the hearing was held, petitioner again initially said, \"There is no point to this hearing.","start":408.128,"stop":416.685,"duration":8.56},{"text":"We have established the basic qualifications for admission to the Bar in California.","start":416.685,"stop":421.775,"duration":5.09},{"text":"And we believe that the only action inconsistent with the Court decision is an order admitting -- certifying me to admission to the Bar.\"","start":421.775,"stop":432.794,"duration":11.02},{"text":"The Committee turned down this motion and then asked petitioner whether he was prepared to answer other questions and petitioner indicated that he was.","start":432.794,"stop":446.585,"duration":13.79},{"text":"The petitioner, at the subsequent hearing, introduced additional letters, some 14 or 15, now making a total of about 55 communications from persons in all walks of life in the Los Angeles community and elsewhere in the country, attesting to his good moral character and for the most part of testing to the fact that -- to the knowledge of the persons writing the letters that he did not advocate overthrow of the Government.","start":446.585,"stop":476.593,"duration":30.01},{"text":"But at the first hearings and before this Court, in the briefs of the State Bar, there had been some comments to the fact that these letters really were not of great significance because they were in written form and there was no opportunity to cross-examine.","start":476.593,"stop":492.779,"duration":16.19},{"text":"And so at this hearing, the petitioner added to the strength of this record.","start":492.779,"stop":497.206,"duration":4.43},{"text":"He offered the persons who had written the letters to be available for cross-examination but in addition to that, he brought his employer for the previous two and a half years as one live witness ready to testify before the Committee and submitting himself to the cross-examination of the Committee if they so wished as to petitioner's good moral character.","start":497.206,"stop":520.576,"duration":23.37},{"text":"The witness testified and at the conclusion of the testimony, the Committee was asked whether they have any questions in cross-examination and they indicated they had none.","start":520.576,"stop":532.495,"duration":11.92},{"text":"Now, what did the Committee do at this hearing?","start":532.495,"stop":535.776,"duration":3.28},{"text":"The Committee introduced not one single bit of evidence to contradict the good moral character already established to the petitioner.","start":535.776,"stop":543.877,"duration":8.1},{"text":"They introduced no evidence of any kind regarding advocacy.","start":543.877,"stop":547.523,"duration":3.65},{"text":"As a matter of fact, they introduced no evidence, period.","start":547.523,"stop":552.444,"duration":4.92},{"text":"The Committee admitted that subsequent to the decision of this Court, the Committee had had an investigator who investigated into the background of the petitioner and stated specifically that if they had any information contrary to good moral character or indicating advocacy on the part of the petitioner, that they would bring this information forward and allow petitioner to rebut it before it would be used in any manner against him.","start":552.444,"stop":582.728,"duration":30.28},{"text":"This is never been done.","start":582.728,"stop":584.544,"duration":1.82},{"text":"It is safe to assume that the investigator found nothing wrong in the background or life of the petitioner.","start":584.544,"stop":593.717,"duration":9.17},{"text":"In addition, the Committee failed to cross-examine.","start":593.717,"stop":597.935,"duration":4.22},{"text":"And the only change, the only change in the record so far is the Committee is concern from that which was before this Court at the time of the prior decision was that the Committee asked again the same questions which it had asked in the record before this Court in 1957.","start":597.935,"stop":617.993,"duration":20.06},{"text":"They again asked the petitioner whether he was a member of the Communist Party.","start":617.993,"stop":622.225,"duration":4.23},{"text":"And this time, they changed the record only to the extent that they did give him a verbal, across the table warning in the sense that they said, \"If you do not answer this question, it will prevent us from further investigating and therefore, it may make it impossible for us to certify you.\"","start":622.225,"stop":645.436,"duration":23.21},{"text":"Now, other than that, there is not one single change in the record that was before this Court in the -- prior to the decision in 1957 and the record that is before this Court today.","start":645.436,"stop":659.983,"duration":14.55},{"text":"Now, petitioner pointed out at this hearing that the principal reasons which he had given before for not answering the question still prevail that as a matter of fact, he felt that he -- there was certain basis for a reinforcement of his principal position by reason of the Supreme Court decision.","start":659.983,"stop":682.133,"duration":22.15},{"text":"And he took basically the position that one of the requirements upon him was that he be of good moral character.","start":682.133,"stop":689.8,"duration":7.67},{"text":"If he had constantly, as he had, both before this Court and before the Committee, taken the position that it was a morally improper for him to respond to these questions, that the Committee was, in effect, placing him in the position where they said, \"If you do not answer the questions, then we will not certify you.","start":689.8,"stop":711.282,"duration":21.48},{"text":"But in effect, if you do answer the questions, you will buy your own definition be saying that you are an immoral person because for purposes of expediency, you are willing to answer the questions which your moral principles say you should not answer.\"","start":711.282,"stop":726.92,"duration":15.64},{"text":"This was the dilemma that the Committee was placing him at.","start":726.92,"stop":730.433,"duration":3.51},{"text":"And of course, he stood on the moral principles and declined to answer the specific questions.","start":730.433,"stop":737.745,"duration":7.31},{"text":"Now, it's evident that so far as the evidence before this Committee is concerned, any change in the posture of the case is a change more favorable to Konigsberg because not only do we have the record of the favorable comments of the people in his community that we had before, we now have additional comments.","start":737.745,"stop":759.879,"duration":22.13},{"text":"We have a live witness who testified and gave the opportunity for cross-examination and we have the concession on the part of the Committee of Bar Examiners that there are investigations into the background and life of Konigsberg had achieved nothing by way of information that would be detrimental to his good moral character.","start":759.879,"stop":781.151,"duration":21.27},{"text":"So that if the record of this case in 1957 could not rationally show a basis for refusing to admit the petitioner, we would submit that such a conclusion is even less reasonable today.","start":781.151,"stop":796.632,"duration":15.48},{"text":"And that simply based on this record and based on the decision of this case, we would submit the petitioner, based on the mandate of this Court, should have been admitted and this Court should make such an order.","start":796.632,"stop":810.132,"duration":13.5},{"text":"But the Committee seemed to be of the belief that in the decision of this Court in 1957, there was some sort of an open door through which they could walk and find a means that this Court was -- was giving them a basis by which they could deny Konigsberg admission to the Bar.","start":810.132,"stop":832.425,"duration":22.29},{"text":"This was really the only conclusion that one can draw from the manner of procedure by which the Committee of Bar Examiners followed up the decision of this Court.","start":832.425,"stop":845.333,"duration":12.91},{"text":"I think then that we should examine this open door type argument and see whether there is any merit to it.","start":845.333,"stop":854.363,"duration":9.03},{"text":"Now, obviously, counsel cannot very well endeavor to interpret what this Court did intend by the decision in 1957 other than by a reasonable and logical reading of the words of the Court.","start":854.363,"stop":871.033,"duration":16.67},{"text":"And therefore, without presuming to try and read into the decision more than appears on the words, I will endeavor to see whether this door really was intended to be left open for the Committee of Bar Examiners.","start":871.033,"stop":886.35,"duration":15.32},{"text":"First, I think, we must consider the elemental unfairness of the position taken by the Committee of Bar Examiners.","start":886.35,"stop":894.476,"duration":8.13},{"text":"We must remember first of all, as I indicated the beginning, that there were two statutory bases in California under which petitioner might have been denied admission to the Bar.","start":894.476,"stop":906.795,"duration":12.32},{"text":"There's no argument that he meets all of the other requirements.","start":906.795,"stop":910.359,"duration":3.56},{"text":"There is no argument that he has passed the bar examination, that he is of proper age.","start":910.359,"stop":914.494,"duration":4.13},{"text":"All of these requirements have been clearly met.","start":914.494,"stop":917.939,"duration":3.44},{"text":"So that the only two statutory requirements that seemed to be in any way involved in this case are the statutory requirements of good moral character and the statutory requirement that he'd not advocate overthrow of the Government.","start":917.939,"stop":931.817,"duration":13.88},{"text":"Now, the evidence relating to these factors was all in the record of this Court prior to the 1957 decision.","start":931.817,"stop":942.118,"duration":10.3},{"text":"And the Court found contrary to the position of the State of California.","start":942.118,"stop":946.283,"duration":4.16},{"text":"The Court specifically said that it could not see how the State of California could've refused admission to a person of Konigsberg's background and said in this opinion that the evidence did not support a finding that he was not of good moral character or that he was not a person who did not advocate overthrow of the Government by force and violence.","start":946.283,"stop":969.778,"duration":23.5},{"text":"Now, Mr. Justice Peters, in his dissent in the California Supreme Court on this second Konigsberg case, stated the theme, I think as clearly as it -- it can be stated.","start":969.778,"stop":985.276,"duration":15.5},{"text":"Mr. Justice Peters said, \"How many times does the issue of whether an applicant possesses a good moral character and as a loyal citizen have to be tried?","start":985.276,"stop":995.059,"duration":9.78},{"text":"When does this litigation come to an end?","start":995.059,"stop":997.83,"duration":2.77},{"text":"I had always though until I read the decision of the majority,\" referring to the majority to California court, in this case, \"that our system of law was predicated on the fundamental theory that when issues between litigants have once been determined, they cannot be re-litigated.","start":997.83,"stop":1013.908,"duration":16.08},{"text":"I had always thought that litigants were required to raise all relevant issues in one proceeding.","start":1013.908,"stop":1020.3,"duration":6.39},{"text":"I had assumed the parties cannot litigate their case piecemeal.\"","start":1020.3,"stop":1024.424,"duration":4.12},{"text":"And Mr. Justice Peters concluded and we believe rightly, although the majority of the California court did not agree with him, that to permit respondent, the State in this case, to lose on one theory and approach to the case and then readjust the record to conform to some new theory, picking out a few words in the decision of the court on the very case is fundamentally unfair, it's arbitrary, it's capricious and it's a denial of due process.","start":1024.424,"stop":1055.34,"duration":30.92},{"text":"And we submit that this is what the State of California has done in this, the Konigsberg case.","start":1055.34,"stop":1061.572,"duration":6.23},{"text":"But let's examine the language of the Court in this Konigsberg case and determine how it applies to the facts of the case as it now stand as the present posture of the case.","start":1061.572,"stop":1074.203,"duration":12.63},{"text":"What did the Court say that lead the State of California to this peculiar interpretation that they were not to then admit Konigsberg to the Bar?","start":1074.203,"stop":1083.992,"duration":9.79},{"text":"The language which they seem to up seized upon reads, \"If and when a State makes failure to answer an independent -- makes failure to answer an independent ground for exclusion, then this Court, as the cases arise, will have to determine whether the exclusion is constitutionally permissible.\"","start":1083.992,"stop":1107.941,"duration":23.95},{"text":"Now, California somehow seems to have taken this statement as some sort of a mandate or a directive for them to take some action against Konigsberg.","start":1107.941,"stop":1119.993,"duration":12.05},{"text":"And I submit that this is directly contrary to the clear import of these words.","start":1119.993,"stop":1125.78,"duration":5.79},{"text":"California completely ignored the words preceding this in the decision which said, \"There is nothing in the California statutes, the California decisions or even in the rules of the Bar Committee which suggest that this is a proper procedure for them to take.\"","start":1125.78,"stop":1145.033,"duration":19.25},{"text":"And the opinion then goes on to point out that establishing such a rule now without fair warning would raise questions with elemental fairness.","start":1145.033,"stop":1154.058,"duration":9.03},{"text":"So California seizes upon this language of -- of fair warning and somehow comes to the conclusion that just sitting down across the table with the very man who has been involved in the lawsuit which has already been determined by the Court and that all they had to do is sit out across the table from him and give him a fair warning now 10 years after he started the practice of law and that this complied with the requirements of due process.","start":1154.058,"stop":1182.084,"duration":28.03}]},{"speakerName":"John M.

requirements of due process.","start":1262.063,"stop":1279.042,"duration":16.98},{"text":"First of all, this warning took place simply by the Chairman of the Committee of Bar Examiners sitting in this session stating to the petitioner, \"This is what we are saying to you that if you do not answer the question, this can be a basis for us refusing to certify.\"","start":1279.042,"stop":1298.878,"duration":19.84},{"text":"But we must remember that this took place seven years after this petitioner commenced the study of law.","start":1298.878,"stop":1307.454,"duration":8.58},{"text":"We must remember that this was four years after he had completed his studies and had passed the bar examination.","start":1307.454,"stop":1314.819,"duration":7.37},{"text":"And this was almost six months after this Court had ruled on the identical facts relating to the same identical

subject.","start":1325.929,"stop":1334.707,"duration":8.78},{"text":"There was no formal rule of the Committee of Bar Examiners passed in accordance with regulations which the Committee of Bar Examiners and the State of California had in effect self-imposed upon them because we have in California a provision which says that the Committee of Bar Examiners may pass a rule approved by the Board of Governors of the State Bar of California.","start":1334.707,"stop":1362.028,"duration":27.32},{"text":"Now, if the Committee was endeavoring to say that this across the table type of warning
