just prior of entry of this consent decree, had decided the landmark Steele and Tunstall cases which contained a complete and new to all of us exposition of the statutory fiduciary duty of bargaining

the Steele and Tunstall cases were decided of course the -- as this Court knows from having reversed both the Supreme Court of Alabama and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, there was a quite a body of authority relied upon by many course to the affect that you couldn't maintain a lawsuit based on discrimination which was joined in by the company and the union.","start":648.978,"stop":682.572,"duration":33.59},{"text":"But, when these cases were decided, there was no longer any point in litigating this lawsuit on the original complaint for the purpose

form of our consent decree force.","start":700.031,"stop":710.212,"duration":10.18},{"text":"But then when we came along after the Railroad Labor Act was amended as to permit a union shop agreement, the railroad suddenly said, \"Do as, well, we won't sign that agreement with you because somebody is going to hold us some contempt of this old decree that says we can't discriminate based on non-membership in the union.\"","start":710.212,"stop":729.662,"duration":19.45},{"text":"So, that's was this case is about and that's what precipitated this motion to modify the injunction.","start":729.662,"stop":738.531,"duration":8.87},{"text":"Now, probably one of the most basic concepts on modification of injunctions is it in -- in injunction does not create a right but simply furnishes the protection, a remedy for the protection of a right which must find its source some place else.","start":738.531,"stop":760.434,"duration":21.9},{"text":"In this case, the source of the right asserted in the original complaint was the Railway Labor Act.","start":760.434,"stop":766.321,"duration":5.89},{"text":"It was the statutory fiduciary duty defined by this Court in the Steele and Tunstall cases.","start":766.321,"stop":777.245,"duration":10.92},{"text":"Now, our position to support of the modification and the injunction is quite simple, these rights stems from the statute.","start":777.245,"stop":785.699,"duration":8.45},{"text":"The statute has now been amended so as to change the nature of the right.","start":785.699,"stop":792.083,"duration":6.38},{"text":"And if we don't have the injunction modified to conform to this change, we're confronted with the situation of these petitioners

shall be permitted to negotiate.\"","start":792.083,"stop":823.612,"duration":31.53},{"text":"And the original plaintiffs and the people that have been intervened in these more recent proceedings

collective bargaining.","start":844.088,"stop":870.564,"duration":26.48},{"text":"In addition to -- to just the inequity of being prohibited from doing something that you have a legal right to do,

enjoy.","start":870.564,"stop":892.057,"duration":21.49},{"text":"We have by railroads argument in this brief, I believe this claim that 2500 employees work during the strike and that everybody that work doing the strike was expelled from the union or was not a member of the union to begin with.","start":892.057,"stop":906.634,"duration":14.58},{"text":"But we took a very small figure for the
