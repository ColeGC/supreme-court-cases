the Court of Appeals refers to as the momentary hesitation on the part of the engineer, which would have not brought the train to anything other than an emergency stop at any

notwithstanding the verdict of motion for new trial, he said, I have endorsed as follows, \"This motion would be granted by this Court if it were free to do so, but this Court construes the opinions and judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States as giving him no option but to deny the motion.","start":734.385,"stop":762.013,"duration":27.63},{"text":"\" And then he went on and made further comments as to his reasons for denying the motions, expanding somewhat the formal endorsement on the motion itself.","start":762.013,"stop":776.935,"duration":14.92},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals in an attempt to (Inaudible) amplify the reason given by Judge Wyzanski for denying the motion gave an opinion on the merits of the case, but it did not reach the question of a motion for a new trial which was filed as I say in the alternative relief motion notwithstanding verdict because they said, \"An appeal had not been taken from that order denying the motion for a new trial.","start":776.935,"stop":815.803,"duration":38.87},{"text":"\" In other words, an appeal was taken merely from the judgment.","start":815.803,"stop":820.966,"duration":5.16},{"text":"And they

the question on the merits, the Court as I have indicated adopted a view different from that argued by the plaintiff below as to the theory of the happening of the accident.","start":835.089,"stop":853.214,"duration":18.13},{"text":"The Court adopted the theory that on the engineer's testimony, there was a scintilla of evidence of negligence towards the woman on the track.","start":853.214,"stop":864.436,"duration":11.22},{"text":"The Court didn't actually discuss negligence towards the hostess in the dining car who was injured, but the Court said the jury might have found a scintilla of evidence towards to the woman on the track in that, the engineer might have applied his brakes immediately upon seeing him when he was 40 feet away instead of that momentary hesitation that he made of seeing her go across and then waiting, saw her turn around and he was definitely convinced at that point that she wasn't going to step back and then he put his brakes in emergency, I submit with the same result that he would have had -- he had put them on at 40 feet rather than a shorter distance as the Court indicates that might have been done.","start":864.436,"stop":915.405,"duration":50.97},{"text":"Now, the Court, as I say, suggests that as the scintilla of evidence and the Court said, and we submit that the Court has misapplied the rules adopted by this Court.","start":915.405,"stop":930.08,"duration":14.68},{"text":"The Court said in reaching its conclusion that the plaintiff no longer has the burden of persuasion and actions of negligence under the Federal Act of Leave.","start":930.08,"stop":941.263,"duration":11.18},{"text":"That only that barest possibility of causation is enough to make out a case for the jury, that only the mere scintilla of evidence to suggest the inference of any possible connection between the engineer's possibly negligent, failure to apply the brakes sooner had arraigned down in suicide was enough to take the case to the jury.","start":941.263,"stop":962.516,"duration":21.25},{"text":"Now, I submit that the Court has misinterpreted the opinions of this Court even though the Court there felt that it was following the opinions of this Court.","start":962.516,"stop":977.24,"duration":14.72},{"text":"And I believe that the rule of the Court now or this Court now is act laid down in the Rogers Case, Rogers against Missouri Pacific 352 United States and in that case, the Court laid down the rule which perhaps I don't need to reiterate but that was the -- the test is whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part even the slightest to produce the injury or death for which the damages are sought.","start":977.24,"stop":1014.824,"duration":37.58},{"text":"Now, the proofs must justify, as I submit with reason and with reason, I submit leave some latitude to the judge in the District Court, the trial judge to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to submit to the jury.","start":1014.824,"stop":1036.473,"duration":21.65},{"text":"Now, Judge Wyzanski clearly indicated that in his opinion, there was no evidence to submit to the jury, no evidence of negligence, but felt that he was bound to submit it to the jury.","start":1036.473,"stop":1049.105,"duration":12.63},{"text":"And the Circuit Court upheld that opinion although it's interesting that the Circuit Court did point out that in its opinion, the trial judge still does have a function of exercising through judicial dis -- discretion or judicial appraisal rather of the facts in the case to determine whether or not has a question of law an issue of negligence is made out.","start":1049.105,"stop":1078.244,"duration":29.14},{"text":"But then on the grounds given in this case which they gave indicate that it is pretty difficult, if not impossible to understand that that Court says for any judge in the court below to give any judicial appraisal of -- of the sufficiency of evidence to where the finding of negligence if the test which they give is carried out.","start":1078.244,"stop":1106.113,"duration":27.87},{"text":"Now, I submit that the Court, of course, wrote its opinion before this Court decided the case Inman against the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in which I feel that the Court applied the doctrine of the Rogers Case and the Inman Case.","start":1106.113,"stop":1127.773,"duration":21.66},{"text":"And that this Court held that in that particular case which came up from Ohio that the Court in Ohio was correct in resting a verdict for the defendant in the case -- in that Court because there was not sufficient evidence to prove that there was negligence on the part of the defendant.","start":1127.773,"stop":1155.766,"duration":27.99},{"text":"So I -- I submit that the Inman case definitely negatives the holding of the Court of Appeals from the First Circuit that there was no further any burden on the plaintiff to prove negligence in the case.","start":1155.766,"stop":1173.515,"duration":17.75},{"text":"Moreover, I think it definitely showed that something more than the mere' scintilla of evidence in the case that must be shown in order to make out a case from the jury.","start":1173.515,"stop":1187.702,"duration":14.19},{"text":"The Court say they'll take the position that a scintilla of evidence and a scintilla of proof, the same thing.","start":1187.702,"stop":1205.045,"duration":17.34},{"text":"Now, the -- I -- I think there's a distinct difference between the -- a scintilla of evidence even if the Court impose so far as to say that is enough to go to the jury and a scintilla of evidence that will make out a case for the jury, I don't think has ever been by adopted by this Court.","start":1205.045,"stop":1232.034,"duration":26.99},{"text":"I think that the Court clearly dealt with a situation almost identical to this in the case of Herdman against the Pennsylvania Railroad, 332 Massachusetts 518.","start":1232.034,"stop":1246.913,"duration":14.88},{"text":"And the Court recalled that that was a case where a sudden stop was made and an engineer said that he
