membership when it's conceded that there is no allegation or evidence in membership when the inquiries occur only in the context of badgering about philosophical and political views, particularly views about the right through -- about the right of revolution, and when silence is couched in a form of refusal to submit to something deemed by the applicant to be in the nature of the test oath and to be improper ungentlemanly and unconstitutional inquiry.","start":100.419,"stop":143.769,"duration":43.35},{"text":"This case began 10 years ago in November of 1950 when the occasion of my

brief in the merits is consigned -- is devoted primarily to a very long and I think careful summary of the facts of the case and I have italicized in it the various places where the Committee backs

answer.","start":1769.212,"stop":1794.619,"duration":25.41},{"text":"They -- they simply say that this would be one more piece of evidence, that's the most they can say, serious, perhaps, but one more

I've ever seen, to restrain them.","start":1827.27,"stop":1831.561,"duration":4.29},{"text":"Consequently, the Committee does not want to bind itself to whatever any particular member might add and -- and therefore, they cannot make a more formal rule such as that which might follow that.","start":1831.561,"stop":1844.576,"duration":13.02},{"text":"If you don't give your name, if you don't give us
