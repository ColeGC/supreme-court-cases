venue shall operate as an adjudication on the merits.","start":515.309,"stop":545.35,"duration":30.04},{"text":"Now there are two ways to approach the interpretation of the rule One, adopted by the District Court is to say that the dismissal here was for lack of jurisdiction.","start":545.35,"stop":557.742,"duration":12.39},{"text":"That by the way is the characterization of the dismissal that was adopted I think by all of the defendants in the prior proceedings when they moved to dismiss.","start":557.742,"stop":565.564,"duration":7.82},{"text":"They filed their motions to dismiss under Rule 12 (b) as motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.","start":565.564,"stop":574.579,"duration":9.01},{"text":"Now the jurisdiction of course means different things for different purposes and I

evident.","start":574.579,"stop":593.394,"duration":18.82},{"text":"The rules give to the Court a discretionary power in a number of instances to specify the effect of the dismissal, to make it with

to control the case where the Court failed to say which way he was exercising his power and that's what Rule 41 (b) does.","start":617.248,"stop":629.579,"duration":12.33},{"text":"It says that unless it is otherwise specified, he shall be deemed to exercise the power to dismiss with prejudice and that I think is not -- is not too great of a burden on the plaintiff because he knows in that kind of

was for lack of jurisdiction as that term is used in this Rule.","start":686.659,"stop":693.029,"duration":6.37},{"text":"Now we acknowledge that it is not a jurisdictional defect for all purposes.","start":693.029,"stop":697.286,"duration":4.26},{"text":"It's certainly we would say does not subject a final judgment to collateral attack for lack of that requirement.","start":697.286,"stop":706.605,"duration":9.32},{"text":"But -- excuse me, you have to give jurisdictions used in this Rule quite a -- a broad scope to include what might be called quasi

otherwise.","start":706.605,"stop":728.711,"duration":22.11},{"text":"We -- the problem isn't limited to this particular dismissal here.","start":728.711,"stop":735.206,"duration":6.5},{"text":"There are a variety of dismissals which no one I think has ever thought would bar later proceedings, nothing in the rules purports to give the judge power to make them with prejudice and which can be accepted only if you put them under the heading of jurisdiction.","start":735.206,"stop":753.031,"duration":17.82},{"text":"For example, a dismissal of a tax refund suit for failure to file an administrative claim for refund, a dismissal for failure to exhaust the administrative remedies, a dismissal of a National Labor Relations Board application for an injunction against the temporary boycott -- a secondary boycott for failure to make a preliminary investigation, dismissals for lack of an indispensable party, for lack of the real party interest.","start":753.031,"stop":788.049,"duration":35.02},{"text":"If all of these kinds of standard or specialized grounds for dismissal rising out statutory preconditions to sue, which I do not think were ever intended to the grounds for dismissals with the prejudice and we would say that all of these ought to be characterized for this particular purpose as dismissals for lack of jurisdiction.","start":788.049,"stop":813.707,"duration":25.66},{"text":"What they have in common is that they -- as fair as I precondition to suit and it stops the litigation, a threshold is never an opportunity to litigate the merits and for -- for purposes of res judicata, they are exactly like any other dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.","start":813.707,"stop":839.781,"duration":26.07},{"text":"Now there's a -- a second approach which was adopted by Judge McGruder in his opinion for the Court of Appeals.","start":839.781,"stop":848.098,"duration":8.32},{"text":"And I think it can be best phrased as turning on a construction of the beginning words unless the Court in a dismissal order otherwise specifies.","start":848.098,"stop":860.058,"duration":11.96},{"text":"Now Costello says that -- argues that an order otherwise specifies only if it uses the magic words without prejudice, but we think that -- in light of the purpose to rule, there's no reason so limit it.","start":860.058,"stop":876.99,"duration":16.93},{"text":"As I've said, the main purpose is to remove the ambiguity in cases where it is not clear whether the dismissal is on the merits or whether the District Court has exercised a discretionary power to impose a dismissal with prejudice as a sanction for some dilatory tactic or -- or for castrating in part.","start":876.99,"stop":902.28,"duration":25.29},{"text":"Now, if that is the purpose of the Rule, it seems to me that an order specifies otherwise even if it does not say without prejudice, so long as it makes clear by any form of words that there has been no determination on the merits and that the District Court is not proportioned to exercise a discretionary power to impose a dismissal having the same effect as one of the merits.","start":902.28,"stop":931.058,"duration":28.78},{"text":"Now, that is precisely, I think, what the order in Costello shows.","start":931.058,"stop":934.965,"duration":3.91},{"text":"It clearly shows that -- as Judge McGruder said, that there's been no -- no determination on the merits and that the District Court did not exercise whatever discretionary power he may have had if he had any to make it with prejudice.","start":934.965,"stop":950.214,"duration":15.25},{"text":"And we think such an order is one otherwise specified.","start":950.214,"stop":955.234,"duration":5.02},{"text":"And, I think that is fully in accordance with everything that this Court has this far intended in these cases.","start":955.234,"stop":964.932,"duration":9.7},{"text":"I'd like to turn briefly to the Lucchese case, which actually the result will turn primarily upon the result in Costello.","start":964.932,"stop":977.268,"duration":12.34},{"text":"If a Court accepts our view in Costello that the original order was not barred with the second suit and for all practical purposes, that -- that moots the question in Lucchese because we were aggrieved by the failure to say without prejudice only because of the doubt of what the effects of the order would be otherwise and if this Court settles the doubt, there's no longer a practically important issue in Lucchese.","start":977.268,"stop":1005.22,"duration":27.95},{"text":"On the other hand, if the Court disagrees who doesn't hope there is a bar, then I think it's clear from what I've already said that the District Court erred in Lucchese in not adding the words without prejudice.","start":1005.22,"stop":1020.667,"duration":15.45},{"text":"So I think the only separate question arising in the Lucchese is the procedural one raised by Lucchese, namely, whether the Government by appealing followed the wrong the procedure to correct the error.","start":1020.667,"stop":1036.166,"duration":15.5},{"text":"Lucchese's argument is -- is that the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction.","start":1036.166,"stop":1042.229,"duration":6.06},{"text":"It just simply does not have power to decide questions of compliance with this Court's mandates and he argues that this is that kind of question.","start":1042.229,"stop":1052.856,"duration":10.63},{"text":"Now, even accepting the premise, I think the short answer is that this is not a question of compliance with this Court's mandate.","start":1052.856,"stop":1060.936,"duration":8.08},{"text":"It is clear that the Court in directing -- remanding case with direction to dismiss did not purport to pass on the question of the nature of the dismissal and that it should with or without prejudice and it was therefore in matter not within the scope of the mandate and a new issue which the Court of Appeals is free to review.","start":1060.936,"stop":1083.971,"duration":23.04},{"text":"And that's really all the Court has to decide in the case.","start":1083.971,"stop":1087.074,"duration":3.1},{"text":"But I would like to say that we, by no means, agree with the premise of Lucchese is that there are any limits on what the Court of Appeals can do in reviewing actions by a District Court, simply because it involves among other things or solely a question of interpretation of a mandate of this Court.","start":1087.074,"stop":1111.612,"duration":24.54},{"text":"The -- there are -- there are Court of Appeals' decisions supporting that.","start":1111.612,"stop":1122.005,"duration":10.39},{"text":"We think that they are the product simply of a historical oversight and I will only very briefly suggest what that is because I suggest that the Court needs to reach it.","start":1122.005,"stop":1138.489,"duration":16.48},{"text":"The -- in cases prior to 1891 in this Court, the Court established that questions of compliance with these mandates could be reviewed by it either on mandamus or by appeal.","start":1138.489,"stop":1154.002,"duration":15.51},{"text":"Now, of course before 1891 there were no Courts of Appeals and so it was perfectly clear that any appeal lay only to the Supreme Court.","start":1154.002,"stop":1161.342,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Now, it would seem to have followed that when the Courts of Appeals were created in 1891 and since the questions could be reviewed by ordinary Courts of Appeal that you could appeal the Court of Appeals from a final judgment.","start":1161.342,"stop":1175.769,"duration":14.43},{"text":"But the -- in later cases, this Court did not carefully make that distinction and continued to repeat the old language.","start":1175.769,"stop":1185.048,"duration":9.28},{"text":"In fact however, all the cases held were that the remedy of mandamus to enforce a mandate had to be sought in the Supreme Court and not in the Court of Appeals and although as I say that the -- some Courts of Appeals have said they have no jurisdiction of appeal, we think that there's no valid reason whatsoever for that.","start":1185.048,"stop":1210.229,"duration":25.18},{"text":"It simply confuses the processes of review.","start":1210.229,"stop":1213.83,"duration":3.6},{"text":"Lucchese says that if it raises a new issue, we must go to the Court of Appeals, but if it raises something within the scope of the mandate we must somehow come to this Court and -- but the question of whether or not the matter is foreclosed by the original mandate, is usually the very question.","start":1213.83,"stop":1235.512,"duration":21.68},{"text":"And so, you have to decide the merits before you decide jurisdiction and I
