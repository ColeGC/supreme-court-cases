like to speak just a few moments about the final point which is raised by petitioner in 179.","start":21.715,"stop":29.659,"duration":7.94},{"text":"That point briefly is that because the alleged error in the judge's charge to the jury, the 25-year sentence under the third column for the aggravated form bank robbery is void.","start":29.659,"stop":43.859,"duration":14.2},{"text":"It seems to us, the Government, that this motion in this respect similarly to the motion raised under Number 70 gives rise to a rather serious question about the orderly proper administration of the rules of criminal law in the federal courts.","start":43.859,"stop":65.251,"duration":21.39},{"text":"That is for this reason as you will note in the record on pages 18 to 23.","start":65.251,"stop":71.916,"duration":6.66},{"text":"At the trial, petitioners, able counsel took various exceptions to the judge's charge.","start":71.916,"stop":79.432,"duration":7.52},{"text":"None of the exceptions in anyway however, raised the particular alleged error that is now being asserted for the first time.","start":79.432,"stop":88.522,"duration":9.09},{"text":"In addition, prior to this motion in Number 179, petitioner has filed three other post-conviction motions, one in 1956, one in 1958, and the one in Number 70, the companion case here.","start":88.522,"stop":107.504,"duration":18.98},{"text":"And none of those three motions was this particular point raised or with any reference in any

attempting to assert an alleged error in the trial judge's charge to the jury.","start":122.965,"stop":140.298,"duration":17.33},{"text":"Now, as we understand the petitioner's argument, it runs somewhat along this line.","start":140.298,"stop":145.849,"duration":5.55},{"text":"This motion is under Rule 35.","start":145.849,"stop":148.866,"duration":3.02},{"text":"Rule 35, of course,

charge?","start":175.581,"stop":179.835,"duration":4.25},{"text":"Well, it voided the judgment of conviction.","start":179.835,"stop":185.075,"duration":5.24},{"text":"Well, it seems to us in effect

dissent?","start":226.55,"stop":231.415,"duration":4.86},{"text":"Well, according to the petitioner's argument, if you look simply at what you might call the common law record papers here, the

example, the Ladner case did not arise under Rule 35.","start":382.486,"stop":394.79,"duration":12.3},{"text":"That arose under Section 2255.","start":394.79,"stop":397.663,"duration":2.87},{"text":"The same is true with the Shelton case, the Askins case and the Morgan case.","start":397.663,"stop":402.631,"duration":4.97},{"text":"The only case cited in petitioner's brief which actually arose under 35 was the Hoffman case.","start":402.631,"stop":408.58,"duration":5.95},{"text":"And the error in the Hoffman case appeared clearly simply from the indictment and the judgment of the conviction of the jury.","start":408.58,"stop":416.376,"duration":7.8},{"text":"There is no question of the charge there, none at all.","start":416.376,"stop":422.2,"duration":5.82},{"text":"Now, of course, we -- the

speak.","start":422.2,"stop":440.851,"duration":18.65},{"text":"But it seems to us again that petitioner is in reality no better off even if this Court should wish to do that, because again, we do not think that this is the type of relief that should be given by way of a collateral attack under Section 2255.","start":440.851,"stop":462.453,"duration":21.6},{"text":"And again, none of the cases cited by petitioners actually so hold.","start":462.453,"stop":468.911,"duration":6.46},{"text":"One of the main cases cited by petitioner is the Ladner case.","start":468.911,"stop":472.814,"duration":3.9},{"text":"But as the petitioner pointed out yesterday in argument, this Court expressly did not pass on this point in the Ladner case, on the

the point in Number 179 here before the trial court.","start":486.261,"stop":495.191,"duration":8.93},{"text":"The record shows at page two here that the District Judge expressly ruled against

other cases cited by petitioner also are quite different.","start":508.479,"stop":513.402,"duration":4.92},{"text":"The Askins case for example involved an indictment which showed on its face that it was outlawed by the statute of limitation.","start":513.402,"stop":522.813,"duration":9.41},{"text":"The Morgan case involved denial of a constitutional right, the right to counsel which is very different than the right to servitude.","start":522.813,"stop":532.289,"duration":9.48},{"text":"None of the cases actually that we know of have gone so far.","start":532.289,"stop":537.141,"duration":4.85},{"text":"In fact, we cite in our brief half a dozen decisions of Court of Appeals which are merely represented where one Court of Appeal after another has denied any relief by way of collateral attack for an alleged misdirection by a judge to adjourn.","start":537.141,"stop":557.092,"duration":19.95},{"text":"The Adams case in page 44 of our brief that alleged error was about intoxication and burden of proof.","start":557.092,"stop":565.161,"duration":8.07},{"text":"Relief denied because it was by way of collateral attack.","start":565.161,"stop":569.372,"duration":4.21},{"text":"The Banks case alleged error and he charged the jury about entrapment.","start":569.372,"stop":574.081,"duration":4.71},{"text":"The (Inaudible) case alleged errors in the charge about burden of proof reasonable doubt.","start":574.081,"stop":580.598,"duration":6.52},{"text":"The Lopez case alleged error in the charge about conspiracy.","start":580.598,"stop":586.24,"duration":5.64},{"text":"The Stevens case at page 44 of our brief, very similar to ours and that the alleged error there related to the definition of jeopardy.","start":586.24,"stop":595.888,"duration":9.65},{"text":"In all of those cases, the appellate courts without any dissent refused to give the type of relief that is sought here for alleged misdirection in an attack as brought here collaterally.","start":595.888,"stop":610.554,"duration":14.67},{"text":"And it seems to us it raises a very basic question whether this type of error can be asserted.","start":610.554,"stop":619.213,"duration":8.66},{"text":"Many, many years after the judgment of conviction, after the time of appeal has expired by way of an indirect attack so to speak

leeway because it can be argued under the allocution point as it's brought out yesterday by counsel for petition, that the sentence there is illegal because there was a violation of Rule 32 (a).","start":645.106,"stop":661.668,"duration":16.56},{"text":"We simply urge the Court not to so hold because of the serious problems that would raise in the proper administration of criminal

person.","start":723.857,"stop":735.332,"duration":11.48},{"text":"I just -- I -- I don't think that is an issue where we -- this case has been argued on the assumption that the question was not directed to the petitioner but I thought that should be like clearly to rest.","start":735.332,"stop":747.101,"duration":11.77},{"text":"The only other point that I would like to raise in the very brief time I have left, relates to this problem of perspective application that has been introduced in the argument here.","start":747.101,"stop":762.085,"duration":14.98},{"text":"In the brief of the Government and the Court of Appeals and in its brief here and it has proceeded solely on the basis on the allocution point that the -- on the merits, our interpretation of the right given by Rule 32

prospectively.","start":801.155,"stop":813.237,"duration":12.08},{"text":"I believe it is fair in considering this question to put to one side the Rule 35 question.At least, I feel I've said about all

sentence.","start":813.237,"stop":835.291,"duration":22.05},{"text":"And I don't think I can add to that.","start":835.291,"stop":838.961,"duration":3.67},{"text":"And I think in Mr. Kramer's

25-year.","start":5995.365,"stop":6018.791,"duration":23.43},{"text":"That's what he meant to do.","start":6018.791,"stop":6020.869,"duration":2.08},{"text":"Now, he did it, I grant you, in an
