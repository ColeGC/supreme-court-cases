Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you think that the Eighth Circuit saw this case as kind of an estoppel case where the school board had in effect told the students you are going to have complete First Amendment rights, or do you think that they saw it as a case that it did not make any difference what the school board said, that once you some students over loose on a newspaper that they have got those First Amendment rights whether the school board wants to have it or not?","start":302.339,"stop":324.862,"duration":22.52}]},{"speakerName":"Robert P.

Baine, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"--Lost control over the paper.","start":357.814,"stop":358.935,"duration":1.12},{"text":"And we submit that the record that we developed in the trial court and that the trial court found in its 21 findings of fact did not support that, nor did the Eighth Circuit when they found that find anything clearly erroneous in the findings of fact of the trial court.","start":358.935,"stop":378.728,"duration":19.79},{"text":"So what we have here, again if I may respectfully continue, is a newspaper which is generated in the second semester by students who have been taught certain values in journalism such as responsible journalism, journalistic ethics, copying, writing, story development, ideas and that sort of thing, and then these students are brought into Journalism II to practice that art under the supervision of that teacher.","start":378.728,"stop":409.629,"duration":30.9},{"text":"And in the practice of that art the teacher, as the evidence in the trial court was adduced, the teacher then gave these students story lines to be developed.","start":409.629,"stop":419.845,"duration":10.22},{"text":"The students developed those story lines, and those story lines were then submitted back and forth to the teacher for as many as four or five revisions.","start":419.845,"stop":429.681,"duration":9.84},{"text":"Evidence in the trial court indicated by the Respondent's own witnesses that a story, for example, in this newspaper on diabetes was not printed at all.","start":429.681,"stop":439.937,"duration":10.26},{"text":"So the student had gone through the process of developing a story on diabetes, but it just was not printed.","start":439.937,"stop":444.812,"duration":4.88},{"text":"Students were given grades whether they printed a story in this publication or not.","start":444.812,"stop":452.576,"duration":7.76},{"text":"So they were graded not only on whether there was ultimate publication or whether their article or their effort was not published.","start":452.576,"stop":460.581,"duration":8},{"text":"Some students did not participate particularly in the writing of articles, but their major job was in the layout, editing, and other things.","start":460.581,"stop":468.538,"duration":7.96},{"text":"In fact, the three Plaintiffs in this case are not the authors of the story in question, but rather were active in the production of the newspaper as layout editor, and one of the Plaintiffs I think assisted in the design of a graph that was used in the story.","start":468.538,"stop":485.678,"duration":17.14},{"text":"In the May 13th issue of the Spectrum, it was proposed to be a six page newspaper.","start":485.678,"stop":497.697,"duration":12.02},{"text":"One additional fact which I think is important in this case is that the teacher who had taught these students in the fall and was teaching these students in the spring semester on April 29th was granted permission by the board of education to leave education and go get a job, had a better offer in private industry.","start":497.697,"stop":517.669,"duration":19.97},{"text":"The board of education through the administration appointed an administrative level journalism teacher as a substitute teacher.","start":517.669,"stop":527.296,"duration":9.63},{"text":"The trial court found that this substitute teacher was a highly qualified teacher, and as a matter of fact was the administrative person to supervise journalism.","start":527.296,"stop":535.4,"duration":8.1},{"text":"And the reason that they appointed such a qualified person to do that is that it was at the end of the year, and two responsibilities remained of the Journalism II class.","start":535.4,"stop":543.876,"duration":8.48},{"text":"One was the production of the final two newspapers, one of which was the May 13th edition, and the other one was the class legacy paper which came out later, both of which according to the testimony were about 90 percent complete when teacher number one left and teacher number two came in.","start":543.876,"stop":561.166,"duration":17.29},{"text":"And the other was the production of the yearbook, a highly complex project on the part of the students, which needed to be completed.","start":561.166,"stop":569.274,"duration":8.11},{"text":"So the administration sent in a very qualified teacher.","start":569.274,"stop":573.806,"duration":4.53},{"text":"When that teacher received the articles from the students and reviewed them, he attempted to contact, as the evidence in trial court showed, he attempted to contact the principal about these stories as he had an objection to them.","start":573.806,"stop":587.544,"duration":13.74},{"text":"He was unable to do that, so he went and put them into proof and sent the proof to the principal, and asked the principal his opinion about it.","start":587.544,"stop":595.199,"duration":7.65},{"text":"And the principal said that those stories because they involved the subject matter that was in them, the story of the three young pregnant ladies who told how they got pregnant, whether they used birth control, the reaction of the father of the child, the reaction of their parents to the pregnancy, and other items, and the article on divorce where a freshman gave a story of why or the recounting of why she believed her parents got divorced and her name was involved, the principal said to Mr. Emerson, who was then the substitute teacher, what can be done about this.","start":595.199,"stop":637.328,"duration":42.13},{"text":"Now you recall that I stated that it was a six page newspaper.","start":637.328,"stop":641.169,"duration":3.84},{"text":"The principal thought at this time and the trial court found, and no one has set aside this fact, the trial court found that the principal believed that Mr. Emerson, the substitute teacher, was at the printers and he needed a yes or no answer at this point.","start":641.169,"stop":656.359,"duration":15.19},{"text":"If he said yes, it would be printed; if he said no, something had to be done.","start":656.359,"stop":660.183,"duration":3.82},{"text":"The principal said what could be done, and Mr. Emerson said we can delete page four and five, and make page six into page four, and we have got a four page paper.","start":660.183,"stop":669.71,"duration":9.53},{"text":"The principal said go ahead and do that, and that is what happened.","start":669.71,"stop":675.212,"duration":5.5},{"text":"So the articles that the principal had an objection to were the articles involving the recounting of the tales of the pregnancy of three school girls and the recounting of the tale of why the parents of one of the freshman, in fact several parents of students, but particularly one named freshman's parents got a divorce, were deleted and the paper was then printed and distributed to the class.","start":675.212,"stop":704.702,"duration":29.49},{"text":"In analyzing the First Amendment issues, the District Court distinguished in this case between privately initiated speech which has strict constitutional rights, and student speech in the context of a school sponsored publication or activity that involved curricula matters.","start":704.702,"stop":726.215,"duration":21.51}]},{"speakerName":"William J. Brennan, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Baine, we have not analyzed First Amendment issues in the school context in public forum terms, have we, have we not usually tested the First Amendment issue by the Tinker test?","start":726.215,"stop":746.44,"duration":20.23}]},{"speakerName":"Robert P. Baine, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"I think, Mr. Justice, that in looking at Fraser, which decided on the same day, that Fraser had a curricula aspect to it.","start":746.44,"stop":757.556,"duration":11.12}]},{"speakerName":"William J.
