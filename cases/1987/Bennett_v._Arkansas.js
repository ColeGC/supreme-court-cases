an important point here because it raises, I think, the mis-rationale of the Supreme Court of Arkansas.","start":522.924,"stop":530.911,"duration":7.99},{"text":"The purpose of social security is to provide for the benefit, the care and benefit and maintenance of the individual, but the purpose of the exemption statute is to assure that these benefits are not subjected to creditors, and that

individuals.","start":530.911,"stop":557.145,"duration":26.23},{"text":"The cost of care is defined as food, clothing, medical care and normal living expenses.","start":557.145,"stop":564.401,"duration":7.26},{"text":"However, the reimbursement statute goes further.","start":564.401,"stop":568.02,"duration":3.62},{"text":"It permits costs of care to include other things because it discusses it in terms of per capita basis later on in the statute, which can mean the cost of providing guards, which is not a social security purpose.","start":568.02,"stop":580.078,"duration":12.06},{"text":"It also provides in the statute that if there is some sort of contempt citation involved, then the cost of that can be taken from
