day regulation of the securities industry, and it has to do with two issues that concern Section 12(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 which provides for an express private right of action against any person who offers or sells an unregistered security through the use of the mails or the interstate commerce.","start":15.491,"stop":39.417,"duration":23.93},{"text":"I would like to state the questions as follows.","start":39.417,"stop":42.639,"duration":3.22},{"text":"First of all, whether the long established definition of a Section 12(1) seller under the Securities Act of 1933 and

financial benefit for his efforts in order to be held responsible for his conduct.","start":42.639,"stop":68.815,"duration":26.18},{"text":"And secondly, whether or not the common law in pari delicto
