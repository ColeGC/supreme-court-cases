and without the benefit of the lens provided by Norris employed by the Eleventh Circuit in its analysis, and by plaintiffs in their argument, the Manhart open market exception in the period before

requiring a wholesale conversion to unisex tables for benefit calculation.","start":856.208,"stop":869.966,"duration":13.76},{"text":"For one thing, the publications of the National Actuarial firms in the period after Manhart stated to the effect that Manhart created more problems than it resolved, and that the pension industry should take a wait and see position.","start":869.966,"stop":890.62,"duration":20.65},{"text":"For another thing, and as previously mentioned, as of January 1983, 45 percent of defined benefit and 74 percent of defined

other words, it is manifestly clear that in Norris this Court intended to wipe the slate clean as of August 1, 1983, for all pension plans in this country.","start":942.753,"stop":956.894,"duration":14.14},{"text":"That prior to that line, there would be no liability if sex distinct mortality tables had been used in benefit calculation, but that subsequent to August 1, 1983, there would be liability if such tables continued in benefit calculation.","start":956.894,"stop":975.605,"duration":18.71},{"text":"The primary concern for the Norris non-retroactive majority's denial of retroactive relief was its concern with the impact a retroactive holding could have on pension plans throughout this country, both private and public.","start":975.605,"stop":996.019,"duration":20.41},{"text":"And that concern was not misplaced, given the percentages of plans which the Department of Labor found in its cost study had not, as of January '83, yet converted to sex neutral tables.","start":996.019,"stop":1011.188,"duration":15.17},{"text":"Moreover, I think the fact that this Court took a highly unusual action in Norris by delaying its judgment three weeks underscores that the Norris decision was intended to apply to all pension plans throughout this country.","start":1011.188,"stop":1032.844,"duration":21.66},{"text":"Since there was no reason to provide a grace period for the Arizona plan at issue in Norris because by the time that plan reached this Court, its objected to provisions had been eliminated.","start":1032.844,"stop":1044.781,"duration":11.94},{"text":"The key is that that grace period was effectively utilized by the FRS in this
