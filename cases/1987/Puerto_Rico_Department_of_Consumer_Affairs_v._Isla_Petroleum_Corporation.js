clause issue has been raised.","start":104.678,"stop":108.318,"duration":3.64},{"text":"The regulation that we are concerned with is internal economic regulation in Puerto Rico which is at the end of the supply distribution chain.","start":108.318,"stop":117.861,"duration":9.54},{"text":"Now before passage of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act in 1973, I think that it was perfectly clear that

states.","start":129.918,"stop":134.587,"duration":4.67},{"text":"And in fact, Puerto Rico did so for about twenty years in a form quite similar in general terms at least to that which was attempted here.","start":134.587,"stop":143.819,"duration":9.23},{"text":"Now under the EPAA, as I say was passed in 1973 in response to the Arab embargo, a temporary statute, there was preemption of conflicting state laws, and certainly Puerto Rico's own regulations were preempted at that time.","start":143.819,"stop":162.109,"duration":18.29},{"text":"But I do not think that anyone contends that

focusing here today on what happened in 1975 when Congress in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act or the EPCA, as we call it, amended the EPAA in Title IV of the EPCA.","start":173.183,"stop":190.098,"duration":16.92},{"text":"Now this question has previously been before this Court in the Tully case in 1981 and 1982, and this Court held in an order vacating a

decided that it could depart from Tully here, which it acknowledged would otherwise be controlling, because it decided that the issue had not been fully considered by this Court, and because it felt that it had received contrary instructions in the subsequent Transco opinion, which it decided was applicable here, because the EPCA revision of the EPAA involved a deregulatory statute similar to what it considered had been done in the Natural Gas Policy Act which revised the Natural Gas Act, which was considered in the Transco opinion.","start":215.071,"stop":256.492,"duration":41.42},{"text":"Our position is that the two statutes involved in Transco and this case are completely

statutory point more in a moment.","start":271.894,"stop":276.065,"duration":4.17},{"text":"And secondly, we think that TECA misread this Court's application of preemption concepts in Transco.","start":276.065,"stop":283.891,"duration":7.83},{"text":"And principally, I think that this occurs because the Court ignored the fact that in the Northern Natural case decided some twenty

Act.","start":283.891,"stop":305.116,"duration":21.22},{"text":"Now TECA was obviously influenced by the way that this Court asked the question as to what was before it in Transco.","start":305.116,"stop":315.674,"duration":10.56},{"text":"It said in revising a comprehensive statute to give market forces a more important role, did the Congress intend to allow the states to step in and act.","start":315.674,"stop":326.858,"duration":11.18},{"text":"And TECA decided that it should ask a similar question here, and look for evidence that the Congress had actually intended to allow the states to act after the federal controls expired.","start":326.858,"stop":339.947,"duration":13.09},{"text":"But as I said, in Transco, this Court had before it a statute which had been held to occupy the field.","start":339.947,"stop":350.443,"duration":10.5},{"text":"Now it has been made clear in a number of cases that where Congress occupies the field that within the

preempt in the case of conflict.","start":383.792,"stop":388.604,"duration":4.81},{"text":"So do not think that the preemption analysis that this Court utilized when it asked that question that TECA was so influenced by that that is applicable to this kind of case.","start":388.604,"stop":401.881,"duration":13.28},{"text":"To the contrary, I think that this Court's usual rule, which it has applied when it is making the initial determination of preemption, that applies either in an occupation case or a conflict case, that you start with the assumption that the historic police powers were
