not a legislatively-binding regulation, then the only questions it presented are whether the Agency adopted a rational construction of its own statute and regulations, and in light of that interpretation, whether its decision to repudiate the manual is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.","start":475.289,"stop":491.75,"duration":16.46},{"text":"We do not think there can be any serious dispute about the answers to these inquiries.","start":491.75,"stop":496.119,"duration":4.37},{"text":"Even if one somehow imagines that Section 1903(f) creates an ambiguity and allows the

way.","start":496.119,"stop":513.181,"duration":17.06},{"text":"The Administrator in this case found that the same size family means what it says, that a \"couple\" is a \"family of two\", and not a

proposed plan amendment would be disapproved, California filed its amendment anyway.","start":599.036,"stop":607.523,"duration":8.49},{"text":"We would submit that this history demonstrates that, although California was no doubt attempting to exploit the manual, it was not in any sense relying on it.","start":607.523,"stop":615.729,"duration":8.21},{"text":"The final argument that has been advanced for avoiding the plain language of Section 1903(f) in the regulations is based on the so-called DEFRA moratorium> [\"].","start":615.729,"stop":625.318,"duration":9.59},{"text":"Section 2373

1903(f), the 4/3rds cap on federal financial participation which was relied upon by the Administrator in this case.","start":653.254,"stop":662.61,"duration":9.36},{"text":"So the short answer to the DEFRA moratorium argument, and we think the complete answer, is that the moratorium concerns a different statutory requirement not relied upon by the Administrator and is simply irrelevant.","start":662.61,"stop":673.084,"duration":10.47},{"text":"The legislative history confirms this analysis.","start":673.084,"stop":678.036,"duration":4.95},{"text":"The primary purpose of the DEFRA moratorium, as the legislative history makes clear, was to give the states greater flexibility in measuring income and resources in determining medicaid eligibility.","start":678.036,"stop":688.177,"duration":10.14},{"text":"As this Court explained in its Opinion in Adkins v Rivera, TEFRA required the states to use the same methodology in measuring and resources for all goods of medicaid recipients.","start":688.177,"stop":699.235,"duration":11.06},{"text":"DEFRA imposed a moratorium on this provision.","start":699.235,"stop":703.103,"duration":3.87},{"text":"This case does not present any issue about measurement of income and resources.","start":703.103,"stop":707.139,"duration":4.04},{"text":"It concerns only the cap on federal financial participation that applies after the measurement process is complete.","start":707.139,"stop":713.543,"duration":6.4},{"text":"TEFRA also required the states to use a single standard of eligibility requirements for all groups of medicaid recipients.","start":713.543,"stop":722.482,"duration":8.94},{"text":"After TEFRA was enacted, some agency employees, although not the Administrator, interpreted the single standard to mean, among other things, that the states had to set the same eligibility requirements for families consisting of one adult and a child and families consisting of two adults.","start":722.482,"stop":738.86,"duration":16.38},{"text":"If this were the correct interpretation, then the DEFRA moratorium would mean that states could now set different eligibility standards for adult couples and families consisting of one adult and a child.","start":738.86,"stop":748.932,"duration":10.07},{"text":"But just because the states can set different relative standards for families consisting of two adults and families consisting of an adult and a child does not mean that either standard can correlate the cap set by section 1403(f)... 1903(f), excuse me, of the Act.","start":748.932,"stop":763.309,"duration":14.38},{"text":"To return to my earlier example, if the amount ordinarily paid to an AFDC family of two is $300, and the Section 1903(f) cap for a family of two is therefore $400, DEFRA would permit a state to set the medically needy income level for an adult couple at $400, and to set the medically needy income level for a family consisting of one adult and a child at something lower, such as $350.","start":763.309,"stop":787.793,"duration":24.48},{"text":"But there is nothing in DEFRA that permits states to violate the federal cap either for adult couples or for any other type of family.","start":787.793,"stop":795.03,"duration":7.24},{"text":"If there were any doubt at all about this it has been resolved by a recent amendment to the DEFRA moratorium enacted just this past August designed to clarify which provisions of the Medicaid Act are covered by the moratorium.","start":795.03,"stop":806.42,"duration":11.39},{"text":"This
