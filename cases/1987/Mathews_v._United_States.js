Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, but I don't see that lays down much substantive law.","start":617.267,"stop":623.071,"duration":5.8},{"text":"Certainly, entrapment is an affirmative defense.","start":623.071,"stop":625.94,"duration":2.87},{"text":"It's created by the courts for that situation where these opinions describe it.","start":625.94,"stop":631.76,"duration":5.82},{"text":"And it seems to me it's quite natural to have it very narrowly tailored since it isn't the absence of a statutory element at all.","start":631.76,"stop":641.199,"duration":9.44},{"text":"And I for one would think there is a considerable danger of jury confusion if you could just introduce it without a very substantial requirement of a showing such as the Seventh Circuit said.","start":641.199,"stop":652.59,"duration":11.39}]},{"speakerName":"Franklyn M.

definition of entrapment.","start":1830.721,"stop":1834.639,"duration":3.92},{"text":"The entrapment doctrine is often said to act as a prophylactic rule that prevents the police from making criminals
