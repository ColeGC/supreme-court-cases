Honor.","start":75.532,"stop":76.673,"duration":1.14},{"text":"The pass mark for that examination was set at the first thousand candidates plus ties and yielded a list of 1,040 candidates.","start":76.673,"stop":89.34,"duration":12.67},{"text":"There is an affidavit by the personnel director at the fairness hearing held in the Hispanic case that the pass mark did not define minimum competency to do the job and this was in response to an objection by certain intervenors who represented ethnic societies that the... to promote the minority officers would somehow lead to promoting unqualified people.","start":89.34,"stop":118.704,"duration":29.36},{"text":"So, the issue of whether or not the minority beneficiaries of the settlement are qualified has been decided and

the first thousand cut-off.","start":128.667,"stop":139.631,"duration":10.96},{"text":"When the racial remedy was employed, after the Hispanic suit was instituted and settled, it turned out that everyone on the list, that's the 1,040 original passers, plus all minority members who would make up the disparate impact perceived to have generated the lawsuit in the first place were promoted, there were still 400 vacancies in the rank.","start":139.631,"stop":175.179,"duration":35.55},{"text":"The Marino Petitioners take the position that as long as there were 400 vacancies in the rank, their exclusion by the employment of the racial remedy was not narrowly tailored to prevent unnecessary trammeling of rights, and that is the issue that brought Marino into court in the first

Podolsky","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, indeed, there are a number of reasons cataloged in my reply brief, Your Honor.","start":272.05,"stop":277.813,"duration":5.76},{"text":"The most important one, of course, is that the remedy existed in 1983.","start":277.813,"stop":282.968,"duration":5.16},{"text":"The second, if a party chooses to intervene in somebody else's lawsuit, their burden of proof is different on some... in many respects from the 1983 action.","start":282.968,"stop":301.334,"duration":18.37},{"text":"The 2nd Circuit, for example, sometimes limits intervenors to just whether or not there's a fairness in the proposed settlement.","start":301.334,"stop":311.252,"duration":9.92},{"text":"Now, in 1983, you don't have to go into whether or not the racial remedy was or was not appropriate.","start":311.252,"stop":319.077,"duration":7.82},{"text":"One of the most important considerations, Your Honor, in answer to your question is that the intervention provision, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, I believe, and I think the 11th Circuit bears me out, is for people that have no other remedy.","start":319.077,"stop":343.958,"duration":24.88},{"text":"Now, for example, the Schneider intervenors, they represented the ethnic societies, were they attempting to get a passing grade here?","start":343.958,"stop":356.765,"duration":12.81},{"text":"No.","start":356.765,"stop":354.547,"duration":-2.22},{"text":"Were they attempting to get promoted?","start":354.547,"stop":357.656,"duration":3.11},{"text":"Their objection was we are police officers, and if you lower the mark for the beneficiaries of the settlement, we are going to be supervised by unqualified people.","start":357.656,"stop":370.354,"duration":12.7},{"text":"They did not have a Fourteenth Amendment provision, and FRCP 24 provides for a person without a remedy to seek redress of an objection that they have.","start":370.354,"stop":385.863,"duration":15.51},{"text":"No remedy, no specific statute giving rise to a plenary action.","start":385.863,"stop":392.188,"duration":6.32},{"text":"Now, the Marino people, they brought their action and it was dismissed as an impermissible collateral attack on a proposed settlement, not a judgment, a proposed settlement.","start":392.188,"stop":409.495,"duration":17.31},{"text":"Where did the 2nd Circuit get the idea of impermissible collateral attack leading to inconsistent results?","start":409.495,"stop":417.6,"duration":8.11},{"text":"That's the verbiage of the Rule 19.","start":417.6,"stop":419.974,"duration":2.37},{"text":"Rule 19 makes it the duty of the people who feel they're going to be subjected to duplication of effort to inconsistent results.","start":419.974,"stop":431.406,"duration":11.43},{"text":"It puts the burden on them when somebody asserts a claim, not has a claim, Rule 19 says a person who claims an interest in an action, which may lead to inconsistent results, the people who are at risk, the parties who may be subjected to inconsistent results, have a duty, not the people who brought the 1983 action, but the people of the lawsuit have a duty to plead, to join, and let's see how strong that requirement is.","start":431.406,"stop":468.361,"duration":36.95},{"text":"Rule 19.","start":468.361,"stop":471.859,"duration":3.5},{"text":"Persons to be joined if

person.","start":474.92,"stop":482.746,"duration":7.83},{"text":"The person claims, not has a claim that he doesn't assert, he must claim an interest, let the folks know I have an interest I am pursuing, he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action, his 1983 action is authorized by Congress, enforcement of your equal protection rights, and is so situated that the disposition

is.","start":565.367,"stop":566.944,"duration":1.58},{"text":"If the person has not been so joined, the court shall order the person to be made a

do so, the person may be made a defendant or in a proper case an involuntary plaintiff.","start":574.02,"stop":584.625,"duration":10.61},{"text":"Now, Justice Scalia, one of the other reasons is Marino was not attacking the promotions.","start":584.625,"stop":594.528,"duration":9.9},{"text":"They took the position that the minority beneficiaries were qualified to hold the position and this was confirmed by the personnel director.","start":594.528,"stop":603.461,"duration":8.93},{"text":"Do we go in as a plaintiff?","start":603.461,"stop":606.07,"duration":2.61},{"text":"Do we go in

bring us in?","start":616.425,"stop":627.327,"duration":10.9},{"text":"No defendant wants to be... no person wants to be made a party to a litigation against his will, but Congress gave the Hispanic
