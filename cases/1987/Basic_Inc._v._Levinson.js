1979.","start":43.074,"stop":47.962,"duration":4.89},{"text":"Essentially, respondents contend that three statements issued by Basic were materially false and misleading insofar as they claimed to have denied the existence of merger negotiations when in fact merger negotiations were on going.","start":47.962,"stop":61.572,"duration":13.61},{"text":"The fact is that the statements at issue which are the key to this case, as are the contacts between Basic and C.E. but the statements did not themselves deny merger negotiations in the sense that respondents claim.","start":61.572,"stop":76.731,"duration":15.16},{"text":"The three statements, the first one issued in October, 1977, was issued by the company because a rumor had been present in the marketplace that Basic was having discussions with a company called FlintKote.","start":76.731,"stop":89.539,"duration":12.81},{"text":"Basic determined that that rumor had no foundation.","start":89.539,"stop":93.241,"duration":3.7},{"text":"Whatever discussions it had were not leading to a merger with FlintKote, and as a result, it properly issued a prompt statement to deny that it was having any discussions with FlintKote.","start":93.241,"stop":104.049,"duration":10.81},{"text":"That statement says, the rumors as to FlintKote are inaccurate and we're having no merger negotiations with anybody.","start":104.049,"stop":110.869,"duration":6.82},{"text":"The second and the third statements don't even refer to merger negotiations.","start":110.869,"stop":115.372,"duration":4.5},{"text":"They're issued in September, 1978, and in November, 1978.","start":115.372,"stop":120.343,"duration":4.97},{"text":"The earlier statement is to the effect that the company is unaware of any reasons for unusual trading activity in its stock, and there are no corporate developments that would account for it.","start":120.343,"stop":131.818,"duration":11.48},{"text":"The November statement is essentially an echo of the September statement and was issued by the company in an effort to insure that its shareholders who might not have seen the September statement which was part of a press release would become aware of the substance of the November statement which was included in a report to shareholders.","start":131.818,"stop":151.03,"duration":19.21},{"text":"No, during this period, beginning even prior to the first statement, Basic had been approached by an executive from Combustion Engineering who had made very clear to Basic that he had an interest in seeing whether a possible acquisition of Basic could be made.","start":151.03,"stop":169.741,"duration":18.71},{"text":"Combustion had a line of business that was very similar to the business that Basic was engaged

and the issuance of the first statement in October, 1977, this individual who would go to Cleveland, Ohio, at times to deal with other businesses that Combustion had, would contact representatives of Basic, would have lunch with them, and would say, I'm interested in your company, I would like to see an acquisition made, can we do something, are you interested.","start":178.897,"stop":207.882,"duration":28.99},{"text":"The Basic representatives told him in no uncertain terms that they were not interested, that they desired to remain

came of it.","start":216.672,"stop":220.876,"duration":4.2},{"text":"And at the time the October, 1977 statement was issued concerning the FlintKote rumor, they had had only brief contact with this individual.","start":220.876,"stop":231.665,"duration":10.79},{"text":"Similarly, in the period between October 1977 and September 1978, they had only three more in-person visits by Mr. Kelly who was the combustion engineering representative.","start":231.665,"stop":245.591,"duration":13.93},{"text":"Significantly, two of those visits concerned an interest that Basic had developed in acquiring the refractories division of Combustion Engineering.","start":245.591,"stop":255.347,"duration":9.76},{"text":"Basic decided that it might be of interest to it to see whether C.E. would be willing to sell that division.","start":255.347,"stop":262.869,"duration":7.52},{"text":"Mr. Kelly agreed to provide certain information.","start":262.869,"stop":267.505,"duration":4.64},{"text":"Meetings were held, one in February, 1978; another one in March, 1978.","start":267.505,"stop":274.36,"duration":6.86},{"text":"And finally, in June, Basic proposed that it acquire Combustion's refractories division.","start":274.36,"stop":281.43,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Mr. Kelly said no, but what if I were to suggest to C.E. that it make an offer to acquire Basic for $28 a share.","start":281.43,"stop":291.555,"duration":10.13},{"text":"The Basic individual said, we wouldn't be interested, but if we were, that would be too low a price.","start":291.555,"stop":297.626,"duration":6.07},{"text":"The individuals had occasional telephone contacts during the balance of June and July, 1978, and then Mr. Kelly stopped calling.","start":297.626,"stop":308.934,"duration":11.31},{"text":"No word was heard from him during August or September or October and November, with the exception of one brief telephone call that he made in September when he became aware as did the rest of the public that Basic had issued a statement denying any knowledge of reasons for unusual trading activities in its shares.","start":308.934,"stop":330.113,"duration":21.18},{"text":"So it is an extreme claim to assert that statements such as these issued by Basic in these circumstances were false and
