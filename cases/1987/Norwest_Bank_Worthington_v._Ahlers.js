Section 1129 (B), previously reflected in this Court's decisions in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber, and others, that the \"absolute priority\" rule could be overcome by the debtor's promising in the plan to devote his future labor, experience and expertise to the reorganized operation.","start":175.913,"stop":225.012,"duration":49.1},{"text":"The essence of it is that, notwithstanding the statute, and the prior decisions of this Court, a bankruptcy debtor under this decision may retain property by a future promise of working without paying his creditors.","start":225.012,"stop":241.688,"duration":16.68},{"text":"The case arises out of the following general facts: The Petitioners are creditors of the debtor who in this case is a farmer.","start":241.688,"stop":252.245,"duration":10.56},{"text":"The Petitioners include the Federal Land Bank of St. Paul and Norwest Bank of Worthington.","start":252.245,"stop":256.964,"duration":4.72},{"text":"The Land Bank's interest began in about 1965 when it made various real estate loans to Mr. Ahlers, and the interests of Norwest Bank Worthington arose in about 1982 when that bank extended various operating loans, all secured by second mortgages on real estate, and by security interests in other collateral.","start":256.964,"stop":277.961,"duration":21},{"text":"The debtors' borrowings from these two institutions amounted to in the neighborhood of $1 million.","start":277.961,"stop":284.051,"duration":6.09},{"text":"By late 1984, the debtors' were in serious default under their loans and filed for protection, under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.","start":284.051,"stop":293.072,"duration":9.02},{"text":"Shortly following that filing the Land Bank and Norwest promptly moved for relief from the bankruptcy automatic stay under Section 362(D) of the Bankruptcy Code to permit foreclose of their mortgages and security interests.","start":293.072,"stop":310.784,"duration":17.71},{"text":"At this time, I think it is common knowledge, the farm economy, particularly in the Midwest, was in a troubled state and secured creditors in particular were seeing the values of their collateral diminish.","start":310.784,"stop":326.71,"duration":15.93},{"text":"Land values in particular had declined sharply and were continuing on the downside.","start":326.71,"stop":331.447,"duration":4.74},{"text":"Indications, Justice White, are that the corner may have been turned, I believe.","start":331.447,"stop":344.089,"duration":12.64}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"I'm glad to know that.","start":344.089,"stop":344.605,"duration":0.52}]},{"speakerName":"Gordon B.

capital.","start":1172.221,"stop":1195.436,"duration":23.21},{"text":"The argument goes that because the debtor in this case will agree to provide services in the future, that is the equivalent of new capital for the operation and therefore it is not a violation of the absolute priority rule to allow the debtor to retain all interest in the property.","start":1195.436,"stop":1214.333,"duration":18.9},{"text":"There are several problems with that.","start":1214.333,"stop":1217.202,"duration":2.87},{"text":"First, it would apply in virtually any Chapter 11 case involving an individual debtor because obviously it is implicit in any individual reorganization that the individual intends to keep working the business.","start":1217.202,"stop":1230.426,"duration":13.22},{"text":"The next argument that is made by the Respondents is that the debtor really would not be retaining anything here, because what is being retained is of no value.","start":1230.426,"stop":1241,"duration":10.57},{"text":"The debtor has no equity in the property, therefore it is valueless, therefore it is not a retention.","start":1241,"stop":1246.202,"duration":5.2},{"text":"The problem with that analysis is that obviously, there is some going concern value here, or the parties would not have been litigating over it for the last three years.","start":1246.202,"stop":1257.994,"duration":11.79},{"text":"This \"no value\" theory is, as I read the Attorney General's amicus brief, not endorsed by

it.","start":1270.468,"stop":1278.907,"duration":8.44},{"text":"The next argument they make is that by agreeing to provide future services, the debtor is injecting new value to the organization which would enable, in effect, the purchase the property over the objection of the creditors.","start":1278.907,"stop":1293.75,"duration":14.84},{"text":"The problem with that argument is that the promise to provide future services is really nothing new.","start":1293.75,"stop":1301.904,"duration":8.15},{"text":"It is implicit in the original loan.","start":1301.904,"stop":1305.206,"duration":3.3},{"text":"Any time I take out a loan for my business, implicit in my promise to repay is that I am going to work in the business to generate funds to repay.","start":1305.206,"stop":1313.812,"duration":8.61},{"text":"What is happening in this situation is that the debtor is seeking to have the level of debt structured down in bankruptcy

is not an item that can be put on the balance sheet of the business organization.","start":1407.173,"stop":1412.844,"duration":5.67},{"text":"It has no present value for liquidation purposes.","start":1412.844,"stop":1416.112,"duration":3.27},{"text":"In short, it does not enhance the estate for creditors at all.","start":1416.112,"stop":1419.581,"duration":3.47},{"text":"If the

obligation.","start":1419.581,"stop":1435.11,"duration":15.53},{"text":"Finally, and I think in the broader context here, the difficulty with what Ahlers does in the overall context of the Bankruptcy Code is that it severely upsets the relative bargaining positions between the debtor on the one hand and the creditors on the other.","start":1435.11,"stop":1456.606,"duration":21.5},{"text":"It gives a very strong tool to debtors in virtually ever case involving an individual reorganization, which is a far departure from what at least I believe Congress had in
