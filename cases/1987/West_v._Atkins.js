medical judgment.","start":392.048,"stop":402.756,"duration":10.71},{"text":"Indeed, it is our position in this case what happened was that Dr. Atkins in his last examination of the petitioner five months after he had first seen him, saw him in his office, said, your achilles tendon has not yet healed, you may need an operation, but you certainly need continuing, regular orthopedic care from me, and that was the medical judgment he entered, and then immediately upon the petitioner leaving the office he wrote on that day in the medical records, I discharged this man from further orthopedic

the Estelle case, seeing a man needing medical treatment and saying, I am not going to allow you to see the physician, that is an infliction of punishment because that's the only access to the medical
