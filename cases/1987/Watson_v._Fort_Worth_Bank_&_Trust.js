Duke Power that announced the doctrine of disparate impact did not carve out an exception for subjective practices, that the legislative history of the 1972 amendments to Title VII also endorsed both disparate impact and the prior case law.","start":39.958,"stop":58.301,"duration":18.34},{"text":"Furthermore, that the EEOC guidelines have applied disparate impact to subjective practices since at least 1970, that there is no bright line between objective and subjective practices that the Respondent would have this Court adopt, and, lastly, that the adoption of this exception would urge employers or at least foster employers more use of subjective practices.","start":58.301,"stop":83.098,"duration":24.8},{"text":"Clara Watson, after having nine years experience as a cashier at a Montgomery Wards, applied in 1973 to Fort Worth National Bank as a teller.","start":83.098,"stop":93.696,"duration":10.6},{"text":"She applied actually several times before she was hired.","start":93.696,"stop":95.897,"duration":2.2},{"text":"When she was hired, she was hired not as a teller but as a proof operator.","start":95.897,"stop":98.899,"duration":3},{"text":"The bank had at that time four black employees, none of them in positions that were visible to the public, and the proof operators and the two proof... I mean printing employees were in the basement and there was a cafeteria employee and a porter.","start":98.899,"stop":114.628,"duration":15.73},{"text":"After three years on the job, she was made a teller at the bank and then, after seven years on the job, in 1980, she first applied for a position, for a supervisory position and actually, in February of '80, there were two supervisory positions that were available; one as the supervisor of the lobby tellers and the other as supervisory of the motor bank tellers.","start":114.628,"stop":135.103,"duration":20.48},{"text":"She applied for each and in each case, she was refused the job and a white male in one instance, white female in another instance, was selected.","start":135.103,"stop":144.548,"duration":9.44},{"text":"One year later, the same two positions became available and she sought both of those positions again with the same result.","start":144.548,"stop":151.283,"duration":6.73},{"text":"A white female was selected for the lobby supervisor and a white male for the motor bank supervisor.","start":151.283,"stop":158.079,"duration":6.8},{"text":"In 1984, even long after the 1981 refusal, she... there were still no black directors, officers or supervisors at the Fort Worth Bank and Trust, despite the fact that the bank is within a few miles of the two main areas of concentration of the black population in Fort Worth, a city that has about a twenty-two percent black population.","start":158.079,"stop":180.742,"duration":22.66},{"text":"The bank system of both hiring and assigning persons to jobs within the bank was one that relied on the decisions of the supervisors, department supervisors, with very little interference from the upper management.","start":180.742,"stop":197.806,"duration":17.06},{"text":"Those supervisors were, of course, all white.","start":197.806,"stop":199.856,"duration":2.05},{"text":"The compensation system that the bank used was a series of... they used evaluations for both supervisory personnel and for line personnel, but those evaluations were filled out by the same supervisors and, once again, all were reviewed by a salary review committee.","start":199.856,"stop":217.627,"duration":17.77},{"text":"The salary review committee rarely changed or affected the decision of those supervisors.","start":217.627,"stop":222.871,"duration":5.24},{"text":"The... both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found that this limited group of white department heads made virtually all the hiring and promotion decisions as well as evaluations used to compute compensation and that the upper management routinely approved those decisions.","start":222.871,"stop":240.684,"duration":17.81},{"text":"Clara Watson, at trial, based on a stipulated data base, presented a very comprehensive statistical study which showed that in the area of hiring, blacks were hired at a rate of 3.5 percent while whites were hired at a rate of 14.8 percent, almost four times greater, and that figure was disputed somewhat by the bank, who claimed that they only hired people... we used all the applications and all the persons who were hired, they disputed that and said we only hire people whose applications were on file for two weeks.","start":240.684,"stop":274.557,"duration":33.87},{"text":"So, during trial, that was also analyzed, although we were able to show that that really wasn't true

O'Connor.","start":300.415,"stop":301.625,"duration":1.21}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Brender, I assume that the proof offered as trial, the statistical evidence,

Brender","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that's correct, Justice O'Connor.","start":320.398,"stop":322.099,"duration":1.7},{"text":"We... it could be used either way, and I think this Court's footnote in Teamsters says that the matter of proof may be applied to either theory.","start":322.099,"stop":330.323,"duration":8.22}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"And if it were remanded, you wouldn't have different proof, it would still be the same statistical evidence?","start":330.323,"stop":336.417,"duration":6.09}]},{"speakerName":"Art Brender","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, I believe so.","start":336.417,"stop":338.409,"duration":1.99}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"So, what is really at stake here?","start":338.409,"stop":341.562,"duration":3.15},{"text":"Does it turn on the different burden of proof aspects under the two types of cases?","start":341.562,"stop":349.406,"duration":7.84},{"text":"Does it turn on what the defendant's burden is to rebut the statistics, in effect?","start":349.406,"stop":355.751,"duration":6.34},{"text":"Is that how you see the bottom line?","start":355.751,"stop":358.834,"duration":3.08}]},{"speakerName":"Art

said--","start":368.658,"stop":370.18,"duration":1.52}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, we haven't said that, have

that.","start":373.232,"stop":374.301,"duration":1.07}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"And I'm just wondering if there's any difference at all in the initial burden of proof under the two types of cases.","start":374.301,"stop":380.836,"duration":6.54}]},{"speakerName":"Art Brender","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think there is in this sense, because at least under Castenada v.
