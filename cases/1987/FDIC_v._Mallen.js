set up the hearing, it has to schedule its witnesses, usually bank examiners, whose schedules may be difficult to adjust.","start":489.178,"stop":500.595,"duration":11.42},{"text":"It has to find an

been indicted to the bank is the danger of sending him back and the fact that in the most difficult case the FDIC may have a hard choice to make.","start":519.774,"stop":538.532,"duration":18.76},{"text":"The FDIC and the system of banking regulation exists to protect the public, to protect depositors, the public in general, and in

other hand, the officer in the most difficult case may have made a strong showing that there are unique facts explaining why despite the indictment which normally would lead him to be suspended it would be safe in that particular case for him to go back to the bank.","start":566.957,"stop":581.952,"duration":15},{"text":"Thus the FDIC in the case in which the statute has to be judged on a facial challenge will have to be making a decision that is hard to make, a difficult decision, and in which the down side risk is very serious of letting the officer go back.","start":581.952,"stop":597.023,"duration":15.07},{"text":"Sixty days is, as this Court recognized in cases like Thirty-Seven Photographs, an expedited time period within which to make a decision anyway, and so it was, we think, quite unsound for the District Court to suggest that Congress acted unreasonably in saying that the FDIC could have as much as 60 days if it needed it, and of course, as has been suggested, we do not know how long it would have taken to make the decision as to Mallen.","start":597.023,"stop":620.873,"duration":23.85},{"text":"Now, the District Court did not decide that 90 days was an unreasonable period of time because it thought that the balance between the competing interests shifted in favor of Mallen or because it just couldn't see a reason to need 90 days to have the hearing and then make the decision.","start":620.873,"stop":638.007,"duration":17.13},{"text":"Rather, it analogized the case, unsoundly, we think, to this Court's decision in Barry against Barchi.","start":638.007,"stop":644.255,"duration":6.25},{"text":"In Barry, a horse trainer had been suspended for allegedly drugging a horse.","start":644.255,"stop":650.721,"duration":6.47},{"text":"The suspension was a penal suspension imposed for 15 days, and it ended after 15 days.","start":650.721,"stop":656.922,"duration":6.2},{"text":"The State Racing Commission had 30 days within which to hold its hearing on the suspended trainer to decide whether to... not to impose the suspension, and then there was no set time period for it to make its decision.","start":656.922,"stop":668.308,"duration":11.39},{"text":"So the way the system was set up in Barry against Barchi, it was possible that a penal suspension would end on its own, would terminate automatically before any hearing was held, but the analogy does not hold up.","start":668.308,"stop":684.036,"duration":15.73},{"text":"What the District Court thought was that since the criminal process might make its decision and thus determine whether or not Mallen could go back to the bank before the FDIC had a chance to hold its hearing and make its decision under 1818(g), that somehow rendered the Section 1818(g) process meaningless, but the difference between the cases is that here Mallen receives review of the FDIC's decision to suspend through both the processes.","start":684.036,"stop":716.835,"duration":32.8},{"text":"Either one can bring the suspension to an end.","start":716.835,"stop":719.974,"duration":3.14},{"text":"If he is acquitted, of course, the suspension terminates.","start":719.974,"stop":722.239,"duration":2.26},{"text":"If the FDIC on the basis of his showing decides that, yes, this is an unusual case in which it would be safe to allow him to come back to the bank, the decision terminates, but review is not cut off.","start":722.239,"stop":732.344,"duration":10.11},{"text":"The situation is not at all like Barry against Barchi.","start":732.344,"stop":735.311,"duration":2.97},{"text":"Also, of course, the District Court's empirical assumption that as a general rule the criminal process would terminate the suspension before the FDIC process did, which was based on the District Court's thinking that the suspension only ran until jury verdict rather than until the end of the criminal process was simply incorrect.","start":735.311,"stop":755.32,"duration":20.01},{"text":"As we have seen, as we were
