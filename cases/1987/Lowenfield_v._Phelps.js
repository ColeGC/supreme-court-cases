Louisiana.","start":318.891,"stop":356.831,"duration":37.94},{"text":"Now, in assessing whether or not the procedures used here had a coercive tendency, it is necessary to consider that the jury in a

jury is determining, based on what it sees and hears, some objective fact in deciding whether to impose the death penalty the jurors are formulating a reasoned moral response and engaging in highly subjective, unique, individualized assessment of whether a particular person deserves to die, and here the reliability of this sensitive and unique procedure and inquiry was threatened by the pressure

was an improper influence on the jury, that when the court instructed the jury that if they voted to stop deliberations or if they couldn't reach an agreement that a life sentence would be imposed, and then the court engaged in these repetitive procedures and didn't call a halt, that a message was coming from the judge that the judge favored the death penalty, and this was emphasized in the modified Allen charge where the judge said the jury should have the objective of reaching a just verdict, a verdict only being necessary to impose death, cessation of deliberations leading to an

risk.","start":643.151,"stop":665.367,"duration":22.22},{"text":"In this case we certainly submit that there was a risk.","start":665.367,"stop":670.52,"duration":5.15},{"text":"And the risk was especially serious in light of the finality of the death sentence.","start":670.52,"stop":676.907,"duration":6.39},{"text":"As the Court indicated in Booth against Maryland regarding victim impact

sentence, and it is apparent that somebody was, because otherwise there would have been a unanimous verdict, so that would indicate that that juror was one who indicated that there should be a cessation, and therefore there should be a life sentence.","start":692.767,"stop":729.376,"duration":36.61},{"text":"Certainly he was under a great deal of pressure, having put his name down on a

the second point, which is that at the end of the guilt or innocence phase trial the Court instructed the jury in accordance with the Louisiana code that in order to convict for first degree murder it
