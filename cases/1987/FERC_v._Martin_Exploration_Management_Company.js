1978.","start":20.478,"stop":29.685,"duration":9.21},{"text":"That Act divides natural gas into a number of categories.","start":29.685,"stop":34.404,"duration":4.72},{"text":"Those categories overlap.","start":34.404,"stop":36.439,"duration":2.03},{"text":"Some of the categories are subject to price ceilings.","start":36.439,"stop":39.558,"duration":3.12},{"text":"Some are now deregulated.","start":39.558,"stop":41.91,"duration":2.35},{"text":"Producers have gone to the agencies that handle the qualification of gas for sale in particular categories, and have obtained qualifications for some gas in both the regulated and deregulated category.","start":41.91,"stop":54.901,"duration":12.99},{"text":"The principal question in this case is how such gas should be treated for purposes of determining the price at which it may lawfully be sold.","start":54.901,"stop":63.156,"duration":8.25},{"text":"The Commission concluded that such so-called dual qualified gas should be treated as deregulated.","start":63.156,"stop":69.91,"duration":6.75},{"text":"We are here asking this Court to uphold the Commission's view of the statute, and to uphold a second Commission ruling which gave rise to the second question in this case and which I plan to discuss at the end.","start":69.91,"stop":81.368,"duration":11.46},{"text":"In considering how this case arose it is useful to have in mind one very common type of gas sale contract that producers entered into in the mid to late 1970s and early 1980s.","start":81.368,"stop":93.926,"duration":12.56},{"text":"Those contracts were for long terms, 20 years or more, and they expressly anticipated the coming deregulation in 1985 and 1987 of the most important of the categories of natural gas under the NGPA.","start":93.926,"stop":108.019,"duration":14.09},{"text":"The contracts provided that until deregulation occurred the gas would be sold at the highest applicable ceiling price set by law or Commission order, and when deregulation occurred, either the price would be renegotiated or it would be determined by reference to some market price.","start":108.019,"stop":126.747,"duration":18.73},{"text":"To ensure the highest possible ceiling price during regulation while providing in advance for a change in pricing upon deregulation, producers obtained qualifications for particular quantities of gas in several different categories under the NGPA, some of which would be deregulated in a few years.","start":126.747,"stop":145.81,"duration":19.06},{"text":"Gas at the time was in very short supply.","start":145.81,"stop":149.012,"duration":3.2},{"text":"Market prices were high, and it looked like prices were going to continue to rise into the indefinite future.","start":149.012,"stop":154.583,"duration":5.57},{"text":"Producers included the deregulation clause in their contracts in the expectation that when deregulation occurred they would obtain higher prices under those clauses.","start":154.583,"stop":164.872,"duration":10.29},{"text":"As the May 1985 deregulation date approached, market prices had dropped drastically and were now well below ceiling prices in some of the alternative categories for which producers have qualified their gas.","start":164.872,"stop":177.616,"duration":12.74},{"text":"Many producers therefore sought to escape deregulation clauses in their contracts by trying to prevent their gas from becoming deregulated and having it treated under one of the still regulated categories for which it had been qualified.","start":177.616,"stop":190.856,"duration":13.24},{"text":"The Commission in late 1984 proposed and issued a rule that rejected this effort.","start":190.856,"stop":196.66,"duration":5.8},{"text":"The rule stated, when gas has been qualified in the deregulated category, it must be treated as deregulated, even if it also happened to be qualified for a still regulated category.","start":196.66,"stop":210.087,"duration":13.43},{"text":"On review, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Commission had misconstrued the NGPA.","start":210.087,"stop":215.574,"duration":5.49},{"text":"It declared a different rule for how to treat gas that falls into a regulated-deregulated overlap.","start":215.574,"stop":221.811,"duration":6.24},{"text":"The Court of Appeals rule says look at individual producers' contract prices and let the producers choose the category under the contracts that actually results in the highest price.","start":221.811,"stop":233.368,"duration":11.56},{"text":"This means that two producers with precisely the same overlap of pricing categories can be subject to different legal treatment depending on what prices they happen to include in their contracts.","start":233.368,"stop":244.741,"duration":11.37},{"text":"What is more, the producers can make the change of status daily.","start":244.741,"stop":248.878,"duration":4.14},{"text":"Depending on market conditions, they can move the gas back and forth between regulated and deregulated status whenever the deregulated price exceeds the regulated price.","start":248.878,"stop":259.484,"duration":10.61},{"text":"We think the Commission's view is much the better reading of the NGPA.","start":259.484,"stop":263.722,"duration":4.24},{"text":"It is a better interpretation of the relevant statutory language and more in accord with the overall NGPA scheme of phased-in deregulation.","start":263.722,"stop":273.01,"duration":9.29},{"text":"First, Section 101(b)(5) of the Act, which addresses the general question of how to treat gas that is qualified in two categories, says that if more than one of the NGPA pricing provisions applies,","start":273.01,"stop":286.753,"duration":13.74},{"text":"\"the provision which could result in the highest price shall be applicable. \"","start":286.753,"stop":291.622,"duration":4.87},{"text":"That language does not, as the Court of Appeals thought, refer to particular producers or to their contract prices.","start":291.622,"stop":300.478,"duration":8.86},{"text":"It requires a determination of which of several statutory ceiling prices is the highest.","start":300.478,"stop":306.898,"duration":6.42},{"text":"The provision with the highest ceiling price is the one that \"could result\" in the highest price, and of course if one provision says that there is no ceiling price, that is the provision that could result in the highest price, and so the gas must be treated under that provision, that is, it is deregulated.","start":306.898,"stop":324.759,"duration":17.86},{"text":"That Section 101(b)(5) should be read as concerned only with ceiling prices and not with particular contract prices is also supported by the approach taken to price regulation by the NGPA as a whole.","start":324.759,"stop":340.853,"duration":16.09},{"text":"The NGPA only sets ceilings, and in fact it expressly provides that the Act is concerned with producers' contract prices only to the extent of ensuring that they are below any statutory ceiling.","start":340.853,"stop":353.862,"duration":13.01},{"text":"In addition, the contracts like the ones I described at the outset show that it is the law that was meant to determine when gas is deregulated under produers' contracts, not the other way around.","start":353.862,"stop":366.42,"duration":12.56},{"text":"It is not the contracts that determine when the gas is deregulated under the law.","start":366.42,"stop":371.49,"duration":5.07},{"text":"One clause of those contracts says, if the gas is regulated, a specified price, often the legal maximum, will apply.","start":371.49,"stop":380.18,"duration":8.69},{"text":"Another clause says, if the gas is deregulated the price is determined by renegotiation or some market reference.","start":380.18,"stop":387.834,"duration":7.65},{"text":"The contracts look to some external action by law or regulation to determine which of those clauses applies.","start":387.834,"stop":396.622,"duration":8.79},{"text":"In fact, there would be a serious circularity if the statute required reference to the contracts, which then required reference back to the statute, and so on.","start":396.622,"stop":405.295,"duration":8.67},{"text":"The Court of Appeals' view would also transform the statute from one that set ceilings to one that established price floors.","start":405.295,"stop":413.817,"duration":8.52},{"text":"Ceiling prices set for a regulated category could always be charged by producers, even if market prices were lower.","start":413.817,"stop":422.673,"duration":8.86},{"text":"That turns the statute upside down.","start":422.673,"stop":425.209,"duration":2.54},{"text":"There is not the slightest indication that Congress believed that the problem with the market was that deregulated prices were too low.","start":425.209,"stop":432.962,"duration":7.75},{"text":"Indeed, the very nature of a price ceiling is that it is intended to hold prices down.","start":432.962,"stop":438.516,"duration":5.55},{"text":"That view is confirmed by Congress's overall plan in the NGPA for phased-in deregulation.","start":438.516,"stop":445.705,"duration":7.19},{"text":"Congress did not intend to create a scheme of ever-increasing producer price subsidies, with the producers always having the option to select a higher regulated price even when market conditions did not justify such a price.","start":445.705,"stop":461.382,"duration":15.68},{"text":"Rather, Congress intended that a market mechanism with all of its natural consequences would be introduced for the determination of prices and levels of production of the designated kinds of gas.","start":461.382,"stop":474.289,"duration":12.91},{"text":"Again, the NGPA as a ceiling price statute is not a producer subsidy statute.","start":474.289,"stop":479.843,"duration":5.55},{"text":"The Commission's view is further confirmed by evidence that Congress intended--","start":479.843,"stop":484.93,"duration":5.09}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
