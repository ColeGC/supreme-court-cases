also involves the relationship between Section 7117 of Title VII, which describes the substantive scope of bargaining in the federal sector and establishes administrative procedures for resolving scope of bargaining or negotiability issues, and the statutory unfair labor practice provisions which make it an unfair labor practice for a federal employer to refuse to bargain in good faith and also establish procedures for adjudicating unfair labor practice cases.","start":124.873,"stop":154.883,"duration":30.01},{"text":"In this case, when respondent Aberdeen Proving Ground announced that

Title VII.","start":203.436,"stop":233.736,"duration":30.3},{"text":"However, respondent Aberdeen argues that compelling need issues alone among all the negotiability defenses available to an employer
