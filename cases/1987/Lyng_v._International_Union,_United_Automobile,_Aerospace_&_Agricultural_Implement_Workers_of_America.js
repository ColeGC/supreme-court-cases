Robbins","textObjs":[{"text":"I think, Justice O'Connor, Congress sought to promote three objectives, and it articulated those objectives in the accompanying Senate report, I believe it's 97-35, that accompanied the legislation in 1931.","start":138.945,"stop":155.908,"duration":16.96},{"text":"Those three purposes are first, as Your Honor mentioned, to achieve what Congress wished to be dramatic changes in its words, in the Federal spending policy.","start":155.908,"stop":170.604,"duration":14.7},{"text":"Congress sought to reduce the overall cost of the Food Stamp program and the Congressional Budget Office estimated in fact that the amendment actually adopted in 2015(d)(3) would save approximately $165 million in food stamp outlays over the three year period 1982 to 1984.","start":170.604,"stop":189.55,"duration":18.95},{"text":"But there were two other objectives as well, apart from simple saving of revenue.","start":189.55,"stop":194.423,"duration":4.87},{"text":"First, Congress believed that it was tying the receipt of food stamps to the ability and willingness to work.","start":194.423,"stop":201.842,"duration":7.42},{"text":"It thought that was consistent with the balance of the food stamp scheme.","start":201.842,"stop":205.419,"duration":3.58},{"text":"It believed and said, that strikers have foregone available employment voluntarily and that union strike funds should be the principal source of benefits during a work stoppage.","start":205.419,"stop":216.445,"duration":11.03},{"text":"Finally and more clearly I think directed to Your Honor's question, Congress attempted to promote additional governmental neutrality in labor disputes.","start":216.445,"stop":227.644,"duration":11.2},{"text":"It believed that providing food stamps to striking workers is an incentive to wait out management, in the Senate Committee's words, rather than to reach compromises.","start":227.644,"stop":237.796,"duration":10.15},{"text":"And it decided that it wished to withdraw that incentive from labor management's disputes.","start":237.796,"stop":243.716,"duration":5.92},{"text":"Now, the District Court for the District of Columbia recognized that these were rational goals and that the legislation enacted in

rational based and heightened scrutiny, the Court found that the statute irrationally discriminated against strikers, unlawfully impinges on their free association rights as well as the rights of their families and their unions to free association and exacts an excessive price for the protected right to strike.","start":261.927,"stop":284.121,"duration":22.19},{"text":"We believe each of these conclusions to be mistaken and we ask this Court this morning to reverse.","start":284.121,"stop":290.649,"duration":6.53},{"text":"Let me turn first, if I might, to the equal protection claim in the case.","start":290.649,"stop":295.273,"duration":4.62},{"text":"It is common ground that Section 2015(d)(3) as social welfare legislation survives equal protection scrutiny if it is rationally related

the outset that we proceed in this argument on the assumption that Congress articulated its real purposes for the statute when it enacted it.","start":310.891,"stop":321.825,"duration":10.93},{"text":"I mention that seemingly uncontroversial point because the amicus party in this case has suggested that Congress' articulated purposes are in fact a camouflage for the anti-labor and anti-union animus that ostensibly in reality motivated the enactment.","start":321.825,"stop":340.395,"duration":18.57},{"text":"But that claim is manifestly false, resting as it does on remarks made in years past by opponents about precursors of the current legislation.","start":340.395,"stop":352.281,"duration":11.89},{"text":"We prefer to take Congress at its word, and I turn directly therefore to the reasons that Congress actually articulated as rational bases for the distinction that it drew in the statute.","start":352.281,"stop":364.183,"duration":11.9},{"text":"Let me start with the cost savings goal.","start":364.183,"stop":367.494,"duration":3.31},{"text":"In 1981, Congress confronted an economy that it believed to be in considerable financial distress.","start":367.494,"stop":375.958,"duration":8.46},{"text":"It therefore resolved to make across the board cuts in a great many Federal programs.","start":375.958,"stop":382.315,"duration":6.36},{"text":"Several of those were made in the Food Stamp Program, and Section 2015(d)(3) reflects one of them.","start":382.315,"stop":388.531,"duration":6.22},{"text":"Now, appellees do not dispute that the Government may legitimately pursue cost savings, but they argue that savings alone cannot justify irrational distinctions.","start":388.531,"stop":400.246,"duration":11.71},{"text":"And we agree.","start":400.246,"stop":401.463,"duration":1.22},{"text":"Distinctions that are otherwise irrational are not made rational simply because they save the Government money.","start":401.463,"stop":407.899,"duration":6.44},{"text":"But the need to conserve funds makes distinctions inevitable.","start":407.899,"stop":412.788,"duration":4.89},{"text":"And when distinctions must inevitably be made, it is equally inevitable that some persons, often with a great deal in common, will fall within and without the favored circle.","start":412.788,"stop":425.36,"duration":12.57},{"text":"Here, Congress drew a dividing line rationally grounded in the determination that strikers at least have a job to go back to and have union strike funds to rely on.","start":425.36,"stop":438.933,"duration":13.57},{"text":"In those critical respects, Congress reasonably concluded that strikers may more easily than other persons absorb the necessary reduction in available benefits.","start":438.933,"stop":449.96,"duration":11.03},{"text":"Once it is seen that Congress drew a rational line in its effort to conserve funds, this Court's decision last term in Bowen against Gilliard instructs that the Statute that it
