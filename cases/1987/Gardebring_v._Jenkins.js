Kirwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.","start":67.708,"stop":71.576,"duration":3.87},{"text":"This case is here on certiorari to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.","start":71.576,"stop":76.897,"duration":5.32},{"text":"The case involves Minnesota's operation of the AFDC program.","start":76.897,"stop":81.932,"duration":5.03},{"text":"There are two issues raised by this case.","start":81.932,"stop":86.17,"duration":4.24},{"text":"First, does an applicant publicity regulation of the Secretary of Health and Human Services require a state to single out one of the myriad eligibility requirements of the AFDC program?","start":86.17,"stop":100.077,"duration":13.91},{"text":"And require a state to give repeated, detailed, written notice of that one requirement to all applicants and recipients?","start":100.077,"stop":109.285,"duration":9.21},{"text":"Minnesota and the Secretary argue that the Secretary's regulations requires states to generally publicize the AFDC program and its eligibility requirements to applicants.","start":109.285,"stop":123.109,"duration":13.82},{"text":"The second issue is equally significant to Minnesota and to other states.","start":123.109,"stop":130.096,"duration":6.99},{"text":"Can a court apply an information regulation of the Secretary in a way that effectively modifies Congress' eligibility requirements?","start":130.096,"stop":140.285,"duration":10.19},{"text":"Can the court require the state to pay AFDC benefits to a person who is without dispute ineligible to receive those benefits under Congress' eligibility statute?","start":140.285,"stop":152.961,"duration":12.68},{"text":"A divided panel of the Eighth Circuit required the state to pay such benefits to an ineligible person.","start":152.961,"stop":160.715,"duration":7.75},{"text":"And enjoined the state from recovering over-payments made to that ineligible person even though Congress had expressly required states to recover all AFDC over-payments.","start":160.715,"stop":172.773,"duration":12.06},{"text":"The Eighth Circuit essentially read the Secretary's information regulation as modifying the statutory eligibility requirement.","start":172.773,"stop":181.712,"duration":8.94},{"text":"And also the statutory recoupment requirement.","start":181.712,"stop":187.099,"duration":5.39},{"text":"The Secretary doesn't interpret his own regulation in that way and the regulation couldn't be interpreted to modify the statutory requirements.","start":187.099,"stop":196.99,"duration":9.89},{"text":"That would be beyond the Secretary's authority.","start":196.99,"stop":199.457,"duration":2.47},{"text":"The specific eligibility requirement involved in this case is the 1981 lump-sum statute.","start":199.457,"stop":206.596,"duration":7.14},{"text":"As the Court will recall from the Lukhard case, which was decided last term, the lump-sum statute provides that when an AFDC family receives an amount of non-recurring income greater than its monthly AFDC grant, the family will be ineligible for AFDC for one or more months, depending on the size of the lump-sum payment and the amount of the monthly grant.","start":206.596,"stop":230.978,"duration":24.38},{"text":"Immediately after the passage of the lump-sum statute, which was part of the Omnibus Budge Reconciliation Act of 1981, Minnesota distributed a letter to all persons who were receiving AFDC in Minnesota at that time.","start":230.978,"stop":246.571,"duration":15.59},{"text":"The letter told them about certain of the OBRA changes.","start":246.571,"stop":251.042,"duration":4.47},{"text":"Now, there were many, many OBRA changes to the AFDC program and Minnesota's letter picked out 19 of the changes that Minnesota thought were the most important.","start":251.042,"stop":261.933,"duration":10.89},{"text":"One of those was the lump-sum statute.","start":261.933,"stop":263.716,"duration":1.78},{"text":"Minnesota sent that letter simply to assist its AFDC recipients and Minnesota had never had the understanding under the federal regulation that it was required to provide advance publicity to recipients that Congress had changed eligibility requirements.","start":263.716,"stop":282.244,"duration":18.53},{"text":"Apart from the 1981 letter, Minnesota's general program of providing information to applicants and recipients is accomplished primarily in two ways.","start":282.244,"stop":294.487,"duration":12.24},{"text":"First, Minnesota provides a pamphlet for AFDC applicants which provides general information about eligibility requirements and other aspects of the AFDC program.","start":294.487,"stop":305.426,"duration":10.94},{"text":"The pamphlet includes descriptions of those eligibility requirements which apply to every AFDC applicant and recipient and which form the framework of the AFDC program.","start":305.426,"stop":317.75,"duration":12.32},{"text":"The pamphlet provides specific information regarding the eligibility requirements which relate to age of children, statutory reason for deprivation of parental support, the two different kinds of income limits, the resource limits of the program, the requirements to participate in work programs and in recovery of child support.","start":317.75,"stop":340.866,"duration":23.12},{"text":"And the pamphlet tells applicants that it does not cover all the AFDC rules, that those rules change and that applicants should consult with their caseworkers concerning the more specific requirements of the AFDC program.","start":340.866,"stop":357.893,"duration":17.03},{"text":"Second, in addition to this pamphlet, Minnesota provides a caseworker to each applicant and recipient to consult with that person concerning the specifics of the AFDC program.","start":357.893,"stop":372.153,"duration":14.26},{"text":"Now, in addition to those information sources, every applicant and recipient knows, based on their participation in the program, on their completion of the application forms and other periodic forms on which they have to report in minute detail their income and resources and family living situations, applicants and recipients know that almost any change in their financial situation affects their AFDC eligibility.","start":372.153,"stop":399.737,"duration":27.58},{"text":"As a general matter, the Secretary and the state have determined, based on their experience in operating the AFDC program, that a lengthy written explanation of eligibility requirements is less helpful to applicants or recipients than an individualized oral discussion at a time when the eligibility requirement is meaningful to the recipient.","start":399.737,"stop":423.77,"duration":24.03},{"text":"In 1984, two and a half years after the OBRA changes became effective, the named Plaintiff, Kathryn Jenkins, intervened in a pending Federal Court lawsuit.","start":423.77,"stop":435.478,"duration":11.71},{"text":"And Jenkins claimed that Minnesota was required to give specific, detailed, periodic, written notice to every applicant and recipient concerning only one requirement of the AFDC program, the lump-sum statute; a statute which affects really a small percentage of the recipients in the AFDC program.","start":435.478,"stop":457.991,"duration":22.51},{"text":"The lower courts agreed with Jenkins' argument and they ordered the state to provide that kind of notice.","start":457.991,"stop":463.978,"duration":5.99},{"text":"And the court held that Minnesota's 1981 letter which included an explanation of the lump sum statute, and which Jenkins had received, hadn't been specific enough in describing the lump-sum statute.","start":463.978,"stop":477.321,"duration":13.34}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A. Blackmun","textObjs":[{"text":"Who was the District Judge, MacLaughlin?","start":477.321,"stop":481.507,"duration":4.19}]},{"speakerName":"John L. Kirwin","textObjs":[{"text":"It was Judge McLaughlin Justice Blackman.","start":481.507,"stop":483.792,"duration":2.28},{"text":"The lower court, we believe, seriously misconstrued the Secretary's regulation.","start":483.792,"stop":490.279,"duration":6.49},{"text":"What does the regulation require?","start":490.279,"stop":492.248,"duration":1.97},{"text":"This is not a regulation that requires detailed notice of every eligibility requirement or even of any specific eligibility requirement.","start":492.248,"stop":501.854,"duration":9.61},{"text":"The regulation says that applicants shall be given information in writing and orally as appropriate about various aspects of the program.","start":501.854,"stop":511.81,"duration":9.96},{"text":"In addition to eligibility requirements, the state has to describe program coverage, scope of the program, other services available, appeal rights, and other rights and responsibilities.","start":511.81,"stop":524.701,"duration":12.89},{"text":"And the regulation requires that the state provide simple pamphlets or bulletins containing information about the program.","start":524.701,"stop":532.105,"duration":7.4},{"text":"The state and the Secretary agree with Judge Fagg's interpretation of the regulation.","start":532.105,"stop":540.643,"duration":8.54},{"text":"Judge Fagg who dissented in the Court of Appeals, said that the regulations simply requires the state to publicize generally in written form and orally as appropriate the AFDC program and its availability.","start":540.643,"stop":554.32,"duration":13.68},{"text":"The 8th Circuit tried to turn the regulation into something completely different from that.","start":554.32,"stop":560.291,"duration":5.97},{"text":"The lower court held that the regulation requires notice of a specific eligibility requirement that the lower court felt was a particularly important requirement.","start":560.291,"stop":569.397,"duration":9.11},{"text":"The court held that the regulation requires that information be provided to applicants despite the fact that the regulation only... excuse me... to recipients despite the fact that the regulation talks only of applicants and it required that the notice be given periodically.","start":569.397,"stop":586.541,"duration":17.14},{"text":"The Court held that the notice must include a detailed description of the mechanics of an eligibility rule, including examples of the rules operation.","start":586.541,"stop":596.047,"duration":9.51},{"text":"None of those requirements is based on any standard contained in the regulation.","start":596.047,"stop":601.201,"duration":5.15},{"text":"The Court simply constructed those requirements on its own.","start":601.201,"stop":605.486,"duration":4.28},{"text":"Under the 8th Circuit's decision, a state can never know, until after the fact, whether it is given enough information or whether it has effectively implemented a provision of the AFDC program.","start":605.486,"stop":619.162,"duration":13.68},{"text":"The 8th Circuit singled out this one eligibility requirement for this type of notice.","start":619.162,"stop":624.566,"duration":5.4},{"text":"The lower Court's decision can be read to require that kind of notice about every eligibility requirement, although it is not completely clear.","start":624.566,"stop":634.255,"duration":9.69},{"text":"That would be virtually impossible to do and even if it could be done, it would be virtually useless to applicants or recipients to overwhelm them with that volume of information.","start":634.255,"stop":643.945,"duration":9.69},{"text":"The Plaintiffs argue that while the lower Court didn't require this type of notice concerning every eligibility requirement, but that the lower Court's decision is not necessarily limited to the lump-sum statute either.","start":643.945,"stop":657.086,"duration":13.14},{"text":"That there may be other eligibility requirements, as yet unidentified, about which the state has to give that kind of notice.","start":657.086,"stop":665.108,"duration":8.02},{"text":"But when you look at what happened in this case, it is easy to understand why those kinds of gray areas make the situation so administratively unworkable for Minnesota and the other states.","start":665.108,"stop":678.666,"duration":13.56},{"text":"In 1981, there was nothing in the regulation or in any interpretation of the Secretary which would have informed Minnesota that it was even required by law to distribute the informational letter or that it was required to single out one provision of the AFDC program, the lump-sum statute, for specialized treatment in that letter.","start":678.666,"stop":702.032,"duration":23.37},{"text":"And in its AFDC pamphlet, Minnesota had no way of knowing, based on the language of the Federal Regulation or any interpretation of the Secretary, that even though not every eligibility requirement had to be described, the lump-sum statute did have to be described and in great detail.","start":702.032,"stop":721.861,"duration":19.83},{"text":"Under the 8th Circuit's decision, a state has to guess about what information is required, and about which eligibility requirements have to be described.","start":721.861,"stop":731.717,"duration":9.86},{"text":"And if a state predicts wrong, if a Federal Court later disagrees with the state's considered judgment, based on its experience, then the state's implementation of the eligibility requirement is set aside for the past months, or even years, as occurred in this case.","start":731.717,"stop":749.178,"duration":17.46},{"text":"Even if the 8th Circuit was correct in its holding that Minnesota was required to provide more information, the Court's remedy here was certainly improper.","start":749.178,"stop":761.503,"duration":12.33},{"text":"Because Kathryn Jenkins had appealed the termination of her benefits, she received continued benefits during that appeal process and when the appeal was resolved, the county agency notified Jenkins that it would recoup the overpayment that had been made to her by withholding one percent of her monthly AFDC grant.","start":761.503,"stop":784.019,"duration":22.52},{"text":"The 8th Circuit enjoined Minnesota from recouping the overpayment made to Jenkins.","start":784.019,"stop":790.839,"duration":6.82},{"text":"The Court said that since Minnesota had not provided enough information concerning this lump-sum statute, the state had not effectively implemented the statute.","start":790.839,"stop":800.295,"duration":9.46},{"text":"And that Jenkins was not subject to the statute, subject to the eligibility condition established by Congress.","start":800.295,"stop":806.384,"duration":6.09},{"text":"The lower Court ordered that Jenkins was entitled to receive and to retain AFDC benefits, even though Congress had expressly said otherwise.","start":806.384,"stop":816.823,"duration":10.44},{"text":"In the lump-sum statute, of course, Congress had said that when an AFDC recipient received a certain amount of income, the recipient would be ineligible for a fixed period of time.","start":816.823,"stop":828.88,"duration":12.06},{"text":"And Congress did not provide that if the state did not provide advance information concerning the requirement, that it did not become effective and that people weren't subject to it.","start":828.88,"stop":839.105,"duration":10.23},{"text":"And in another of the 1981 OBRA changes, Congress said that if any recipient received more benefits than he or she was entitled to receive, the state was required to recoup that overpayment of
