FOIA exemptions.","start":3036.149,"stop":3054.687,"duration":18.54},{"text":"By the same token, attorney client material, attorney work product doctrine material, the two other core privileges that

that could not be protected under other exemptions.","start":3070.307,"stop":3083.318,"duration":13.01},{"text":"Because as this Court said in Federal Open Market Committee v.
