going to say, not only does the individual have a right to bring an action against the union if it breaches its duty of fair representation in arbitrarily acting against him in these beginning stages,

aside the action that was taken by the carrier.","start":1485.032,"stop":1515.588,"duration":30.56},{"text":"And we submit that there are three basic fundamental premises that uphold the right of the collective bargaining representatives to enter into such restricted access to the grievance process.","start":1515.588,"stop":1530.597,"duration":15.01},{"text":"The first reason is is that judicial interpretations of the National Labor Relations Act, and also the Railway Labor Act, do not sanction minority or rival union representation in the processing of claims and grievances.","start":1530.597,"stop":1549.142,"duration":18.55},{"text":"The second reason is, contrary to what petitioner asserts, the language of the Railway Labor Act does not promote minority union handling of grievances at the company level.","start":1549.142,"stop":1562.751,"duration":13.61},{"text":"As a matter of fact, if I may make an aside here, Congress specifically knew how to use language, as recognized by the lower courts, when it did anticipate that an individual could be represented by more than himself or by the certified collective bargaining representative, when it used the specific language that it did in Section 3 First (j) of the Railway Labor Act.","start":1562.751,"stop":1586.017,"duration":23.27},{"text":"Insofar as company handling, on-the-property handling, it used different language and that language was, the usual manner of handling up to and through the chief operating officer of the railroad designated to resolve or adjust grievances.","start":1586.017,"stop":1606.93,"duration":20.91},{"text":"We submit, and this would be consistent with all the cases that have been cited by the petitioner, that where you have a usual manner here with a railroad that came into existence with its own employees on January 1, 1983, and entered into agreements with all of the unions providing for exclusive handling of their grievances by the certified collective bargaining representative or by the individual, that that becomes the usual manner of handling on that property.","start":1606.93,"stop":1641.235,"duration":34.3},{"text":"And therefore the Court would never have to reach the other issues that have been raised in this case, although we think that the First Circuit was correct when it ruled that operating employees of railroads, just as employees covered by the National Labor Relations Act, and also employees who are considered to be non-operating employees, are no different.","start":1641.235,"stop":1666.886,"duration":25.65},{"text":"That under those circumstances, as I indicated previously and as accepted by leading scholars of the labor

addition to the specific language of the Railway Labor Act which we assert does not promote minority union handling of claims and grievances, we also submit that both the 1934 amendments to the

the elimination of competition between unions.","start":1710.129,"stop":1747.671,"duration":37.54},{"text":"That proposition was stressed a number of times in the 1934 hearings, both by the draftsman

Chairman of the Railway Labor Executives Association.","start":1747.671,"stop":1769.952,"duration":22.28},{"text":"The very purpose of the Section 2 rights and Section 3 process was to eliminate

Eastman and Mr. Harrison were asked questions in regard to handling of grievances by more than just the individual and more than the certified collective bargaining representative.","start":1793.318,"stop":1812.613,"duration":19.3},{"text":"And both those gentlemen said that maybe we should open it up, so that you could have minority unions handle grievances at company level proceedings.","start":1812.613,"stop":1825.337,"duration":12.72},{"text":"And Mr. Harrison specifically said that there is certain language that could be incorporated into Section 2 Fourth.","start":1825.337,"stop":1836.062,"duration":10.72},{"text":"And some of that language has been taken out of context by the Courts in McElroy and the Court in Taylor and used as a basis for

United Transportation Union is asking for today was rejected by Congress.","start":1848.203,"stop":1860.36,"duration":12.16},{"text":"That language was never inserted into the Railway Labor Act of 1934.","start":1860.36,"stop":1866.081,"duration":5.72},{"text":"Then we proceed to 1951.","start":1866.081,"stop":1868.95,"duration":2.87},{"text":"And in the hearings on the Union Shop amendments in 1951, one of the purposes was to do away with the freeloader.","start":1868.95,"stop":1876.739,"duration":7.79},{"text":"But Mr. Harrison again spoke in favor of the union shop

temporary transfers, and as Justice O'Connor's question of my brother, Miller, indicated, this Court in Rychlik did state, at least on three occasions, that the purpose of Section 2 Eleventh (c) was to handle a very narrow problem, a very specific problem and that was solely for the temporary transfer of firemen to engineers and back, because they would only work a few days in the craft, and then
