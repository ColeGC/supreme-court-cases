Zech.","start":131.533,"stop":151.779,"duration":20.25},{"text":"However, the Court of Appeals thought it possible that Doe had been dismissed on the basis of a general policy for dismissing all employees with a homosexual orientation.","start":151.779,"stop":166.622,"duration":14.84},{"text":"And in that event, it became incumbent upon the Agency to explain, in the Court's words, \"at the very least\", why such a policy was necessary and advisable in the interest of the United States.","start":166.622,"stop":183.084,"duration":16.46},{"text":"The Court of Appeals concluded, of course, that, to the extent that these questions must be pursued in the District Court, that review was not precluded under the Administrative Procedure Act by Section 102(C).","start":183.084,"stop":201.129,"duration":18.04},{"text":"It has been our position in all courts and it is our position today that Section 102(C) of the National Security Act of 1947, which sets up the Central Intelligence Agency, precludes judicial review, under the APA, of this question.","start":201.129,"stop":220.876,"duration":19.75},{"text":"It is important at the outset I think to have a sense of the structure of the 1947 Act as a whole.","start":220.876,"stop":232.248,"duration":11.37},{"text":"It is quite a short statute.","start":232.248,"stop":233.933,"duration":1.69},{"text":"It is a statute which establishes the Agency.","start":233.933,"stop":238.051,"duration":4.12},{"text":"The first provision says there shall be a Central Intelligence Agency and a director and a deputy director, and then goes on to say what will happen if the director is a member of the military.","start":238.051,"stop":253.745,"duration":15.69},{"text":"The next section, which is Subsection (C), the one in question here, which is the very first substantive section of the Act, states that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 751, or the provisions of any other law, the Director of Central Intelligence may, in his discretion, terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the Agency whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.","start":253.745,"stop":288.318,"duration":34.57},{"text":"That is the first substantive section of the Act setting up the Agency.","start":288.318,"stop":293.221,"duration":4.9},{"text":"The next section, the very next section, sets out the powers and duties of the director and the Agency, and that section contains the provision which was the subject of this Court's recent decision in CIA v. Sims.","start":293.221,"stop":309.814,"duration":16.59},{"text":"It is that section which states that the Director of Central Intelligence shall be responsible for protecting intelligent sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.","start":309.814,"stop":321.455,"duration":11.64},{"text":"In our view, these two sections are really flip sides of each other, that the general injunction upon the Director to protect the intelligence sources and methods of the United States implies, and then that it has set out the specific duty to protect the integrity and security of the CIA work force.","start":321.455,"stop":349.705,"duration":28.25},{"text":"It seems to us, further, that the decision of this Court in CIA v. Sims, which dealt with the latter provision, sets the tone and sets the context for the consideration of the case here.","start":349.705,"stop":366.567,"duration":16.86},{"text":"In the Sims case, the Court of Appeals, the same Court of Appeals as decided this case, while recognizing the very special and delicate position of the Agency, went on to give that provision what this Court described as a \"crabbed interpretation\", an interpretation which would allow a considerable amount of what I would call rummaging around in the business of the Agency in litigation, through deposition, through

Fried","textObjs":[{"text":"I think it certainly did.","start":423.17,"stop":424.253,"duration":1.08},{"text":"What the Court said was that there was a possibility that the firing was on the basis of a general policy relating to employees with a homosexual orientation.","start":424.253,"stop":440.865,"duration":16.61},{"text":"Therefore, it was open for District Court to inquire what the policy is.","start":440.865,"stop":447.702,"duration":6.84},{"text":"And, Justice O'Connor, it is not sufficient, I suppose, once you get into litigation, for the Agency simply to say well, we have no such policy.","start":447.702,"stop":456.042,"duration":8.34},{"text":"Because the litigant can say, yes, you do, and let's have a lawsuit about that.","start":456.042,"stop":460.844,"duration":4.8}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Is it open to the Director to protect himself from judicial inquiry by saying in

aspects of its decision, said that if the Director intended to terminate the employment without giving a reason, that that would be all right.","start":471.052,"stop":487.977,"duration":16.92},{"text":"But if, however, he was terminating the employment on the basis of this policy, that would trigger the responsibility of the Director to explain at the very least why his decision and that policy was necessary and advisable.","start":487.977,"stop":508.725,"duration":20.75},{"text":"Therefore, it would seem to me that it is open to a persistent litigant in every case to say you, Director, did not intend to give reasons, but it seems to us that nonetheless, you acted under a general policy and now we think that policy is unconstitutional and you must at the very least explain why it is advisable.","start":508.725,"stop":532.356,"duration":23.63}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"If it is

Fried","textObjs":[{"text":"I would be very happy to rest content with that, except I don't know what it gives me.","start":541.029,"stop":549.402,"duration":8.37},{"text":"I am afraid that I am buying an empty bag there, because the Court of Appeals, while it acknowledge that possibility, I don't think would have been content with a simple statement that that is what we intend.","start":549.402,"stop":567.114,"duration":17.71},{"text":"Indeed, it is a little hard to know how the Director could have more clearly indicated that he was not putting forward reasons, and inviting inquiry into the basis of his action, because what he stated was that he is terminating the employment because he deems it necessary and advisable.","start":567.114,"stop":587.86,"duration":20.75},{"text":"Now, that seems to me to be about as good a way as any to say I don't want to give any further reasons.","start":587.86,"stop":595.431,"duration":7.57},{"text":"And yet, the Court of appeals said well, let's rummage around a little bit more to see what we come up with.","start":595.431,"stop":603.453,"duration":8.02},{"text":"And that is what I think is intolerable.","start":603.453,"stop":605.572,"duration":2.12}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day

a policy not to hire a black or a woman or something of that kind?","start":622.164,"stop":629.568,"duration":7.4},{"text":"Justice O'Connor, if the policy related to hiring or promotion, Congress has subjected the CIA, in 72, to Title VII, so that we would not that.","start":629.568,"stop":642.993,"duration":13.43},{"text":"I think what we are talking about is termination of employment.","start":642.993,"stop":647.695,"duration":4.7},{"text":"And termination of employment is a very special matter, because if you are an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, you have access to the most sensitive intelligence information which this country possesses.","start":647.695,"stop":665.591,"duration":17.9},{"text":"And the only way to remove that access is to terminate the employment.","start":665.591,"stop":672.93,"duration":7.34},{"text":"I think that is why such a special emphasis is given to the issue of termination of employment and why it, in the Congressional scheme, this is a Congressional scheme, it stands on a different footing from the initial employment decision or even promotion decisions.","start":672.93,"stop":693.093,"duration":20.16},{"text":"The Central Intelligence Agency is subject to Title VII and in fact welcomes the procedures that are involved because it considers that those procedures in their invocation which involve a considerable amount of internal review, maintains the kind of morale inside the Agency which they are very anxious to have.","start":693.093,"stop":719.291,"duration":26.2},{"text":"But there does come a point where the Agency simply must be able, without giving reasons and without triggering the kind of inquiry, narrow as the Court said it was, but wide as we think it is, without triggering the kind of inquiry in open court.","start":719.291,"stop":735.42,"duration":16.13},{"text":"Why would a Title VII promotion suit involve any less rummaging around?","start":735.42,"stop":745.942,"duration":10.52},{"text":"I mean, one agent says I've done a better job on my covert assignments, and I can prove it.","start":745.942,"stop":754.215,"duration":8.27}]},{"speakerName":"Charles Fried","textObjs":[{"text":"There are a number of very important reasons.","start":754.215,"stop":758.285,"duration":4.07},{"text":"There is confession and there is avoidance, Justice Scalia.","start":758.285,"stop":760.951,"duration":2.67},{"text":"Certainly what is involved in Title VII is a requirement to go to the Agency and to pursue internal remedies there.","start":760.951,"stop":772.443,"duration":11.49},{"text":"And the fact that there have been a handful, literally a handful... well, seven; I suppose that's a hand and part of a second hand... of those cases filed, since 1972, indicates that the internal procedures take care of the matter.","start":772.443,"stop":791.173,"duration":18.73},{"text":"Now, you can have the lawsuit.","start":791.173,"stop":794.392,"duration":3.22},{"text":"The important thing is that that lawsuit itself might be trumped by 102(C).","start":794.392,"stop":802.98,"duration":8.59},{"text":"And it is important to keep that possibility open.","start":802.98,"stop":807.116,"duration":4.14}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"I thought you were rejecting that possibility.","start":807.116,"stop":810.051,"duration":2.94},{"text":"I thought you were saying 102(C) does not prevent the Title VII lawsuits for promotion but it does prevent this.","start":810.051,"stop":816.888,"duration":6.84}]},{"speakerName":"Charles Fried","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, there would be the promotion and perhaps there might be damages paid, but if it was determined that this person no longer is somebody with whom the Agency is comfortable as somebody with access, then they could terminate that employee.","start":816.888,"stop":836.349,"duration":19.46}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"No, they have not terminated him.","start":836.349,"stop":837.784,"duration":1.43},{"text":"They just have not promoted him.","start":837.784,"stop":838.984,"duration":1.2},{"text":"He says he is entitled to a promotion.","start":838.984,"stop":840.753,"duration":1.77},{"text":"And you say that a lawsuit will lie.","start":840.753,"stop":843.205,"duration":2.45}]},{"speakerName":"Charles

decision.","start":851.542,"stop":855.344,"duration":3.8},{"text":"We are saying that Congress made quite a different decision as to the termination of employment.","start":855.344,"stop":861.481,"duration":6.14},{"text":"And I think that is a rational line to draw.","start":861.481,"stop":865.766,"duration":4.28}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"It seems to me irrational.","start":865.766,"stop":866.885,"duration":1.12},{"text":"I would think that you would want to give the individual more protection for dismissal than you would for promotion.","start":866.885,"stop":872.288,"duration":5.4}]},{"speakerName":"Charles Fried","textObjs":[{"text":"The person who is interested in pursuing a promotion claim is a person who is interested in working within the Agency and who the Agency it interested in keeping on in some capacity or another.","start":872.288,"stop":888.981,"duration":16.69},{"text":"That person, on both sides of the transaction, is still as it were, part of the family.","start":888.981,"stop":895.035,"duration":6.05},{"text":"When you have a termination matter, you have a person who at least one side of the relationship wishes to sever entirely.","start":895.035,"stop":905.093,"duration":10.06},{"text":"That is just a balance which was struck by the Congress.","start":905.093,"stop":910.831,"duration":5.74},{"text":"It is also worth noting that Title VII lawsuits involve particularly serious and traditionally particularly important Constitutional rights.","start":910.831,"stop":923.721,"duration":12.89},{"text":"If Congress decided, which it has, that discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, are forms of discrimination which are simply intolerable, then that is a conclusion which we must bow to.","start":923.721,"stop":943.152,"duration":19.43},{"text":"This is not a Constitutional argument we are making.","start":943.152,"stop":945.818,"duration":2.67}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"All of that goes, it seems to me, though, not to... you have been objecting to rummaging around.","start":945.818,"stop":950.872,"duration":5.05},{"text":"It seems to me the rummaging around is going to be the same in both cases.","start":950.872,"stop":953.622,"duration":2.75},{"text":"Now, I can see a distinction between the two, based not on the rummaging, but on the fact that the Courts absolutely have no power to require the Director to hire somebody he does not want in his office.","start":953.622,"stop":963.929,"duration":10.31},{"text":"That is a different point from rummaging.","start":963.929,"stop":966.131,"duration":2.2},{"text":"I could see drawing the distinction between Title VII non-firing cases and other Title VII case on that basis.","start":966.131,"stop":974.487,"duration":8.36},{"text":"That is, the Court has the power to prevent him from promoting someone, or from not promoting someone, but he has absolutely no power to prevent him from telling somebody to be gone.","start":974.487,"stop":985.526,"duration":11.04},{"text":"But that is not what you seem to be

going to be subject to lawsuits in a variety of areas.","start":1011.176,"stop":1019.016,"duration":7.84},{"text":"Congress did not say everything the Agency does, whatever it might be, and to whomever it may do it, is absolutely precluded from review.","start":1019.016,"stop":1030.305,"duration":11.29},{"text":"And my argument should not be taken as asserting that.","start":1030.305,"stop":1033.757,"duration":3.45},{"text":"What I am asserting is that Congress drew a line.","start":1033.757,"stop":1037.725,"duration":3.97},{"text":"Perhaps the line should have been drawn somewhere else, as a matter of policy.","start":1037.725,"stop":1043.028,"duration":5.3},{"text":"But Congress drew the line where it drew it.","start":1043.028,"stop":1045.98,"duration":2.95},{"text":"And we are saying that where it has drawn that line, it should be respected.","start":1045.98,"stop":1052.068,"duration":6.09},{"text":"And the Court of Appeals, while it gave a tip of the that to the important policies there, in effect authorized the most extensive kind of inquiries.","start":1052.068,"stop":1066.894,"duration":14.83},{"text":"And that, we think, is what Congress intended to preclude in 102(C), though, to be sure, they did not intend to preclude
