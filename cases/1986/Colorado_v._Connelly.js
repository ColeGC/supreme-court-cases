location in southwest Denver.","start":173.961,"stop":196.875,"duration":22.91},{"text":"The police were able to determine pretty quickly that they... an unidentified female body had been discovered in April of 1983 and the defendant actually then took a couple of the officers out to the scene of the murder, showed them where he had committed the murder and how he had hidden the body and covered it with a mattress.","start":196.875,"stop":215.705,"duration":18.83},{"text":"The defendant told his public defender, members of the public defender's staff shortly after that that he had come to

on the psychiatric report, he was found to be incompetent to proceed and he remained at that status for about six months until the same psychiatrist filed a new report saying that he then considered the defendant competent.","start":232.481,"stop":245.89,"duration":13.41},{"text":"Now, at that point the defendant filed a motion to suppress all of his statements and to suppress all of the evidence derived from them because his confession was involuntary and because it was in violation of Miranda.","start":245.89,"stop":258.197,"duration":12.31},{"text":"All the facts that I have already mentioned came out at the suppression hearing, but in addition to those facts the psychiatrist testified at the suppression hearing that the defendant suffered from chronic schizophrenia, that he had something which the psychiatrist called command auditory halucinations, and that the defendant had told him that he had experienced the voice of God telling him to come back from Boston to Denver and to either confess or to kill himself.","start":258.197,"stop":288.384,"duration":30.19},{"text":"The trial court granted the motion to suppress, but he did so in a way on narrow grounds.","start":288.384,"stop":294.705,"duration":6.32},{"text":"Despite the fact that he found that the the police had not done anything untoward or caused the confession, he nevertheless found that the defendant was incapable of making a voluntary confession for the reason that he felt compelled to follow the mandate of God, which the court found to be a product of his psychosis.","start":294.705,"stop":311.333,"duration":16.63},{"text":"The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed, but in affirming it made a slight refinement on the suppression order which is very important for the review here.","start":311.333,"stop":324.058,"duration":12.72},{"text":"It upheld suppression of the initial confession, the initial statement, the one that was unsolicited, as involuntary, as a violation of the due process old voluntariness standard.","start":324.058,"stop":337.484,"duration":13.43},{"text":"However, it upheld suppression of all the statements after that point as... well, for the reason that as a result of the defendant's mental condition it felt that he was incapable of making an effective waiver of Miranda rights and therefore all subsequent statements were in violation of Miranda.","start":337.484,"stop":354.696,"duration":17.21},{"text":"Let me add one note about Colorado procedures here that might be helpful in explaining the nature of that ruling.","start":354.696,"stop":361.45,"duration":6.75},{"text":"In Colorado and, as I understand, some other jurisdictions in the country, because of the language in Miranda that says the prosecution will bear a heavy burden in establishing a waiver of Miranda rights, the burden on the people in Colorado is higher to establish a waiver of Miranda rights than it would be to establish the voluntariness of the confession itself.","start":361.45,"stop":383.965,"duration":22.51},{"text":"In Colorado we use the formula by a preponderance of the evidence to establish the voluntariness of a confession, but by clear and convincing evidence to show an effective waiver of Miranda rights.","start":383.965,"stop":394.987,"duration":11.02},{"text":"It seems to me that there are two things about these facts that make this case, and that make it different from the other cases that the Court has decided in this area.","start":394.987,"stop":406.426,"duration":11.44},{"text":"The first one, pretty obviously, is the fact that the initial confession was completely unsolicited.","start":406.426,"stop":414.531,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The police did not know the defendant at all.","start":414.531,"stop":417.15,"duration":2.62},{"text":"They had done nothing to him at that point.","start":417.15,"stop":419.268,"duration":2.12},{"text":"Let me say quickly that the reason that that is important, though, I do not think is because completely spontaneous or unsolicited confessions are very prevalent, and we don't know what to do with unsolicited confessions.","start":419.268,"stop":432.66,"duration":13.39},{"text":"As was the case here, and I think would almost always be the case, there may be... even where there is a spontaneous confession of this kind or spontaneous statement, there is going to be... the significant material that comes out will probably be in response to follow-up question of some kind.","start":432.66,"stop":452.656,"duration":20},{"text":"So, probably the complete absence of police behavior is not the central point.","start":452.656,"stop":457.727,"duration":5.07},{"text":"By the way, probably a larger class of confessions that will be affected very much by what is decided in this case in the area of statements made that have nothing to do with police practices probably would be statements made to private individuals, and what I am thinking of particularly are statements, statements made to private individuals in which a defendant subsequently comes forward and asserts that he was intoxicated, or for some other reason that he didn't voluntarily make that statement to a private individual and at that point seeks a Jackson v. Denno hearing to establish voluntariness.","start":457.727,"stop":497.935,"duration":40.21}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Coats, do I understand you correctly to say that Colorado as a matter of state law requires a clear and convincing standard of proof for waiver of Miranda rights?","start":497.935,"stop":512.028,"duration":14.09}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan B.

I think that... and really what I meant to be saying here is, think the importance of that decision will not only go to the question of unsolicited confessions, although that is the way it is posed here.","start":673.015,"stop":688.357,"duration":15.34}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"--I have trouble finding... when a man walks up and says \"I want to confess\", I have trouble finding Miranda in there.","start":688.357,"stop":697.879,"duration":9.52}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan B.
