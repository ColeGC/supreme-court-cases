Postal Service.","start":80.868,"stop":94.859,"duration":13.99},{"text":"But in the course of developing the cause of action, neither Congress nor this Court had developed a statute of limitations to govern hybrid actions in the course of creating the hybrid action.","start":94.859,"stop":107.436,"duration":12.58},{"text":"Thus, in UPS v. Mitchell and DelCostello v.

law.","start":107.436,"stop":121.778,"duration":14.34},{"text":"Ultimately in DelCostello, the Court made a policy judgment that, as compared to three or six-year limitation periods, which is what were at issue in Mitchell and DelCostello, or a three month statute of limitations, also at issue in Mitchell, a six month limitation period set forth for unfair labor practice charges before the NLRB was the most appropriate and therefore should be used as the statute of limitations for DFR actions, duty of fair representation actions, in district

was discharged in November of 1981.","start":167.641,"stop":174.128,"duration":6.49},{"text":"Over the course of more than two years, Petitioner was repeatedly assured by his union representative that the union was pursuing a grievance for reinstatement and back pay.","start":174.128,"stop":185.953,"duration":11.83},{"text":"During this period of time he was represented solely by his union, and

1984, West received a notice from Conrail saying that, solely as a matter of leniency, he would be reinstated.","start":197.761,"stop":208.384,"duration":10.62},{"text":"The notice did not refer to the pending union grievance and did not say that the union had abandoned his claim for back pay.","start":208.384,"stop":216.074,"duration":7.69},{"text":"However, in March of 1984 West determined that the union had in fact abandoned his back pay claim.","start":216.074,"stop":224.228,"duration":8.15},{"text":"Now, had West sought to institute unfair labor practice proceedings at the National Labor Relations Board, he could have gone to the NLRB on the last day of the six month limitation period.","start":224.228,"stop":238.171,"duration":13.94},{"text":"He would have had to fill out a few blanks in an administrative form which we have set forth as the last page of our brief.","start":238.171,"stop":245.843,"duration":7.67},{"text":"The form would have been filed and served on the same day, and service would have been effective upon mailing.","start":245.843,"stop":253.497,"duration":7.65},{"text":"Instead, West had to find a lawyer, although he had been unemployed for a period of more than two years.","start":253.497,"stop":262.769,"duration":9.27},{"text":"He had to make financial arrangements to retain the lawyer.","start":262.769,"stop":265.821,"duration":3.05},{"text":"The

time.","start":300.158,"stop":304.11,"duration":3.95}]},{"speakerName":"Paul Alan Levy","textObjs":[{"text":"--It is in part the only thing that is relevant, although if in fact one of our arguments is that if in fact the Court is going to borrow the service requirement of Section 10(b) as well as the limitations period, then the question will arise, why not borrow the other things that the board has said are all that a charging party has to do in order to file an unfair labor practice claim?","start":304.11,"stop":329.511,"duration":25.4},{"text":"And we propose to draw a line, a clear line, at the limitations period and not go on to the other timeliness rules, including the service rule.","start":329.511,"stop":339.367,"duration":9.86},{"text":"In any event, the complaint was filed within the six month period, but the summons and complaint were not served until three weeks later.","start":339.367,"stop":349.306,"duration":9.94},{"text":"And so the question on which the circuits are closely divided is is the suit untimely on the ground that the service requirement in Section 10(b) should be adopted to govern the case.","start":349.306,"stop":361.648,"duration":12.34},{"text":"Now, in arguing that it should not, we rely first on the normal rule for federal question claims, and in stating the normal rule I recognize that this Court has not dispositively decided the question.","start":361.648,"stop":376.123,"duration":14.47},{"text":"But virtually every lower court to address the question for the past 40 years, as well as the court below, have taken the view that the normal rule is that under Rule 3 filing the complaint satisfies the statute of limitations in a federal question case in the district court.","start":376.123,"stop":396.036,"duration":19.91}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

not true in a diversity case.","start":398.719,"stop":400.071,"duration":1.35},{"text":"We rely on the existence of a normal federal rule for two reasons: First, because there is a normal federal rule, it is not necessary to look to Section 10(b), or indeed anywhere else, to fill a gap in federal law, as the Court had to do to pick a limitations period in DelCostello.","start":400.071,"stop":422.603,"duration":22.53},{"text":"And second, because there is a rule, Respondents who seek an exception from the rule bear some sort of burden of showing that the exception is justified, and we don't think that they have shown that an exception is justified.","start":422.603,"stop":437.696,"duration":15.09},{"text":"But even if Rule 3 does not control, we think that the better rule is that filing alone is sufficient.","start":437.696,"stop":446.469,"duration":8.77},{"text":"After all, in DelCostello the Court decided that, given the policies and the practicalities of litigation involved, a six month period was better than a three or a six year period on the long end or a three month period on the short end.","start":446.469,"stop":463.494,"duration":17.03},{"text":"Now, we recognize the consequence of choosing either a filing rule or a service rule is that the statute of limitations will not be exactly six months for both sides.","start":463.494,"stop":474.886,"duration":11.39},{"text":"If the Court requires service, then the plaintiff will be required to file in advance of six months; and if filing alone is sufficient, the defendant will not learn of the suit for some time after six months.","start":474.886,"stop":489.129,"duration":14.24},{"text":"But we submit that the consequences of adopting only the filing rule are on balance more attractive or, I should say, more consistent with the policies and practicalities involved than adopting the whole package of NLRB timeliness rules.","start":489.129,"stop":508.375,"duration":19.25}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Isn't one practicality that we don't want to have to fight this thing out or have

most equitable thing in this particular case?","start":521.683,"stop":529.455,"duration":7.77},{"text":"Isn't there some desirability of having a more or less uniform rule?","start":529.455,"stop":532.324,"duration":2.87},{"text":"And if we were to adopt a uniform rule, wouldn't the one that seems to be current, wouldn't that be the rule of borrowing the whole thing, including the service?","start":532.324,"stop":542.012,"duration":9.69}]},{"speakerName":"Paul Alan Levy","textObjs":[{"text":"Precisely, and the uniform rule, the traditional rule in the federal courts, is that filing is sufficient to satisfy the statute of limitations, rather than simply looking at each statute of limitations and then trying to discern from the rules adopted by the

limitations itself does not say requires service, then it is appropriate not to borrow the service requirement which is contained in some other section.","start":633.105,"stop":646.43,"duration":13.32},{"text":"And I would agree that most states, when they draft statutes of limitations, have a list of periods and then perhaps a list of tolling rules, and then another section which says this is what we mean by satisfying the statute of limitations.","start":646.43,"stop":661.089,"duration":14.66},{"text":"But surely, if it is inappropriate to borrow the service requirement in those cases, the mere fact that the service requirement appears in the same section of the United States Code or the state code, so long as it's a borrowed section, shouldn't make any difference, we submit.","start":661.089,"stop":683.122,"duration":22.03},{"text":"That is a distinction without a

question cases.","start":692.811,"stop":701.083,"duration":8.27},{"text":"But in doing so, it would be overruling a consistent line of precedent in all of the lower courts, and indeed it would be going contrary to the understanding that we think, given the advisory committee notes back when the rules were adopted and the rules concerning 4(j) in 1983 the drafters of the rule seemed to think that the logical interpretation of the rule, although they recognized that there was an open question, that the logical interpretation of a rule that says an action is commenced by the filing of the complaint, means the statute of limitations is satisfied in that context.","start":701.083,"stop":739.375,"duration":38.29}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
