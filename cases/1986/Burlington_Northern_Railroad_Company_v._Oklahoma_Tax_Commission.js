Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":10.106,"stop":13.491,"duration":3.39},{"text":"This case involves the interpretation of Section 306 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976.","start":13.491,"stop":23.163,"duration":9.67},{"text":"This Act was passed by Congress in response to a major financial crisis in the railroad industry.","start":23.163,"stop":29.935,"duration":6.77},{"text":"In addition to providing an immediate infusion of federal funds, the Act took the first steps toward deregulation at the federal level and placed restrictions on the powers of the states with respect to the railroads.","start":29.935,"stop":44.01,"duration":14.08},{"text":"In Section 306, Congress declared state tax discrimination against railroads to be an undue burden on interstate commerce and in an express exception to the Tax Injunction Act, granted the federal courts jurisdiction to remedy any violations.","start":44.01,"stop":61.205,"duration":17.2},{"text":"The key substantive provision is Section 306(1), which appears at page 20-A to the Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari.","start":61.205,"stop":73.798,"duration":12.59},{"text":"Subsection 1 declares that it is unlawful for the states to engage in any of a series of prohibited acts.","start":73.798,"stop":82.135,"duration":8.34},{"text":"Subsection A and B are directed to the assessment of railroad property at a percentage of that property's true market value which is higher than the percentage of assessed value to true market value of other commercial and industrial property.","start":82.135,"stop":98.664,"duration":16.53},{"text":"Subsection C is directed to and prohibits tax rights which are higher for railroads than for non-railroad property and subsection D prohibits any other tax which results in discriminatory treatment of a railroad.","start":98.664,"stop":116.141,"duration":17.48},{"text":"The specific issue in this case is whether Section 306 gives the federal courts jurisdiction over a claim of tax discrimination resulting from the overvaluation of a railroad's property.","start":116.141,"stop":128.933,"duration":12.79},{"text":"In its complaint in this case, Burlington Northern alleged that in 1982 the state of Oklahoma had over-valued its property.","start":128.933,"stop":138.741,"duration":9.81},{"text":"And that as a result of that overvaluation, its property had been assessed at a percentage of assessed value to true market value which was higher than the percentage of assessed value to true market value for other commercial and industrial property.","start":138.741,"stop":156.868,"duration":18.13},{"text":"The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.","start":156.868,"stop":160.654,"duration":3.79},{"text":"The 10th Circuit, relying on its own prior decision in the Lennen case upheld the dismissal of the complaint, holding that generally Section 306 does not grant the federal courts jurisdiction over state tax discrimination which results from overvaluation of a railroad's property.","start":160.654,"stop":181.234,"duration":20.58},{"text":"It carved out one exception holding that the federal courts would have jurisdiction if the railroad could make a strong showing prior to trial of purposeful overvaluation with discriminatory intent and upheld the District Court's conclusion that Burlington Northern's affidavits have failed to make such a showing.","start":181.234,"stop":201.064,"duration":19.83},{"text":"The same issue has been considered by two other Circuits.","start":201.064,"stop":204.266,"duration":3.2},{"text":"Both the 8th Circuit and the 9th Circuit have held that Section 306 grants the federal courts jurisdiction over all claims of state tax discrimination, specifically including discrimination resulting from the overvaluation of a railroad's property and that no showing of discriminatory intent is required.","start":204.266,"stop":227.464,"duration":23.2},{"text":"Before I turn to the text of the statute I believe it is important to emphasize one point and that is that it is clear from the reports of Congress that its goal in enacting this statute was to put an end to state tax discrimination against railroads.","start":227.464,"stop":244.658,"duration":17.19},{"text":"As a practical matter, discrimination can result just as readily from the overvaluation of the railroad's property as it can from undervaluation of other commercial and industrial property or from higher tax rates.","start":244.658,"stop":259.483,"duration":14.83},{"text":"Thus if Section 306 does not encompass discrimination which results from overvaluation of the railroad's property the statute will be left with a gaping hole and will not accomplish its purpose.","start":259.483,"stop":273.243,"duration":13.76}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

Interstate Commerce Commission and by various congressional sponsors of the bill.","start":618.167,"stop":626.321,"duration":8.15},{"text":"Beyond this, Justice O'Connor, it is apparent that the states themselves did not interpret Mr. Lanier and other railroads' testimony at the time, as constituting any promise that railroad valuation would not be an issue because subsequent to those remarks the states continued to vehemently oppose enactment of this legislation, stating as one of their principal reasons the fact that it would require the federal courts to become involved with state

mean?","start":674.652,"stop":675.318,"duration":0.67},{"text":"I mean, if the federal courts are going to decide this uniformly presumably they're going to have to use one methodology.","start":675.318,"stop":682.74,"duration":7.42},{"text":"The reason you use different methodologies is that they tend to produce different results.","start":682.74,"stop":687.025,"duration":4.28},{"text":"Now there's a broad range of results which you might say are fair even though the methodologies come up with different outcomes, you

applied properly and the appropriate adjustments are made to take into account the facts of the particular situation.","start":806.471,"stop":816.844,"duration":10.37},{"text":"What the District Court would do would be to hear expert testimony, witnesses produced by both the state and the railroad with respect to the application of the various methodologies to the facts of the particular case
