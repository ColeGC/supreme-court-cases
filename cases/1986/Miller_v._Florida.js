offense.","start":72.846,"stop":80.952,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The reason for the longer sentence was that Florida changes its sentencing guidelines law to boost the sentences, and applied that change retrospectively to Mr. Miller.","start":80.952,"stop":91.308,"duration":10.36},{"text":"The state says that increasing his sentence retroactively does not matter, because the guidelines are discretionary, or proecedural.","start":91.308,"stop":99.414,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The serious flaw in that argument, as demonstrated in the briefs, is that departure from the guidelines is not discretionary and is not treated as such under Florida law.","start":99.414,"stop":109.435,"duration":10.02},{"text":"This retroactive increase in the punishment imposed upon Mr. Miller is invalid

point.","start":167.156,"stop":168.308,"duration":1.15},{"text":"Under Florida law, the way the guidelines work is that there is a primary offense, which is the most serious offense at the time of the offense... at the time, under the amended guidelines which we say shouldn't apply, but anyway, under the amended guidelines the sexual offense would be the primary offense.","start":168.308,"stop":185.401,"duration":17.09},{"text":"The burglary would be an additional offense, and it's scored and calculated as part of the total picture.","start":185.401,"stop":194.673,"duration":9.27}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, but if the amendment did not affect the burglary offense, and the guideline was not changed for that, then even if you are correct, would you not look back to the law at the time he was sentenced for burglary, and would that become the primary offense?","start":194.673,"stop":213.967,"duration":19.29}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony Calvello","textObjs":[{"text":"Under the original

because, see, the primary offense would be the most serious offense at the time.","start":221.787,"stop":230.577,"duration":8.79},{"text":"And therefore the burglary would become--","start":230.577,"stop":233.077,"duration":2.5}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"So even if you're right, the burglary would then be the most important

years.","start":259.724,"stop":272.299,"duration":12.57},{"text":"If you score the burglary as the most serious offense, it's still 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 years.","start":272.299,"stop":277.369,"duration":5.07},{"text":"But what happens here is that they changed the guidelines, and then sexual offense became the primary offense, and they changed the points for sexual offenders, they added 26 points for that.","start":277.369,"stop":290.176,"duration":12.81},{"text":"There's where the 7 years came in.","start":290.176,"stop":292.544,"duration":2.37},{"text":"So it wouldn't matter whether it was sex or burglary under the old laws, he'd still get 3-1/2 to 4-1/2.","start":292.544,"stop":297.83,"duration":5.29},{"text":"But under the new guidelines, he had... the sex became the primary offense, and he got the increased sentence of 7 years.","start":297.83,"stop":305.286,"duration":7.46},{"text":"Basically, under the guidelines, the Florida sentencing guidelines which came in effect in 1983 abolished parole.","start":305.286,"stop":314.708,"duration":9.42},{"text":"And the Florida criminal code was divided into nine categories, one of which was sexual offenses.","start":314.708,"stop":320.612,"duration":5.9},{"text":"Now, people are given points, as I pointed out, based on the severity of the offense.","start":320.612,"stop":324.729,"duration":4.12},{"text":"They're added together and totalled, and you get a range.","start":324.729,"stop":327.681,"duration":2.95},{"text":"And your sentence would fit into that range, as I mentioned earlier.","start":327.681,"stop":331.067,"duration":3.39},{"text":"And the judge's only discretion would be within that range, that 3-1/2 to 4-1/2, 5-1/2 to 7.","start":331.067,"stop":337.121,"duration":6.05},{"text":"And this sentence is presumptive under Florida law.","start":337.121,"stop":341.441,"duration":4.32},{"text":"And it is assumed to be correct for the offender.","start":341.441,"stop":344.227,"duration":2.79},{"text":"The operation of the Florida guideline system demonstrates that there are meant to be precise and narrow punishments.","start":344.227,"stop":351.481,"duration":7.25},{"text":"The guidelines do not guide discretion; rather, they operate like a computer.","start":351.481,"stop":356.201,"duration":4.72},{"text":"You put in the offender characteristics, you put in the offense, et cetera, and you add it up and you come out with a narrow, mechanically determined, presumptive guideline range.","start":356.201,"stop":366.14,"duration":9.94},{"text":"And the sentence must fall within that range, this presumptive range.","start":366.14,"stop":372.71,"duration":6.57},{"text":"Moreover, th law adopted in conjunction with the guidelines, and the practice of the courts, the Florida Supreme Court and the lower court, as detailed in the brief, make clear that a trial judge's authority to go outside these... this presumptive guideline sentence is meant to be, and is, extremely limited.","start":372.71,"stop":390.088,"duration":17.38},{"text":"Now, there is a departure.","start":390.088,"stop":392.155,"duration":2.07},{"text":"But a departure up or down, even to go below that, is not discretionary.","start":392.155,"stop":397.992,"duration":5.84},{"text":"And that is one of the main points I want to make today.","start":397.992,"stop":400.444,"duration":2.45},{"text":"It is not discretionary.","start":400.444,"stop":401.563,"duration":1.12}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day

no.","start":423.143,"stop":425.929,"duration":2.79},{"text":"Because once you implement these guidelines, and if you make like Florida, if you make it presumptive, an enforceable right, like here,

when we're dealing with people's sentences.","start":457.214,"stop":464.97,"duration":7.76},{"text":"Because you get into what I would consider to be the most substantive matter there could

this case.","start":608.541,"stop":613.243,"duration":4.7},{"text":"Not only is it difficult to depart, but very important, under Florida law, there is a right to an appeal, an appellate review of

Miller's presumptive sentence would have been the 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 years, but he received a 7 year sentence.","start":655.772,"stop":665.795,"duration":10.02},{"text":"And the reason for that, which I wanted to get to, was that the Florida legislature wanted to increase the punishment for sex offenders by increasing the point total for the sexual offense category.","start":665.795,"stop":677.119,"duration":11.32},{"text":"The more points scored, the higher the presumptive sentence, or the quantum of punishment for this

incarceration for sexual offenders.","start":685.208,"stop":703.92,"duration":18.71},{"text":"Thus, not only the effect but the intent was substantive; to increase punishment, to increase the quantum of punishment.","start":703.92,"stop":711.424,"duration":7.5},{"text":"Simply put, more people will go to jail under the amended guidelines than under the original guidelines which were in effect; ex post facto violation.","start":711.424,"stop":720.263,"duration":8.84},{"text":"And this switch was substantial for Mr. Miller.","start":720.263,"stop":723.232,"duration":2.97},{"text":"Because since these guidelines points correspond to a predetermined sentencing range, the base sentence for sexual offenses was effectively increased.","start":723.232,"stop":732.503,"duration":9.27},{"text":"The effect, as predicted, was to boost the point score.","start":732.503,"stop":736.105,"duration":3.6},{"text":"And he received a sentence of 7 years.","start":736.105,"stop":739.593,"duration":3.49},{"text":"There was absolutely no departure.","start":739.593,"stop":741.459,"duration":1.87},{"text":"This was

Florida law.","start":761.84,"stop":768.91,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Because the legislature, in creating the guidelines, recognized that developing sentencing criteria was primarily a matter of

under the Florida constitution, the legislature has the sole responsibility for substantive law, and the court for procedures.","start":796.763,"stop":809.571,"duration":12.81},{"text":"So here the
