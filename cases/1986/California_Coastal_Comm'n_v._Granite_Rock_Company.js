reason pulls out of the coastal zone management program or if the federal government terminates our authorization, the state will continue to enforce the Coastal Act.","start":253.663,"stop":266.471,"duration":12.81}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, it may not be the same program, but it is certainly the same sort of coastal zone

that it must include in its management program a definition of permissible land and water uses.","start":382.427,"stop":393.135,"duration":10.71},{"text":"Now, that's the equivalent of zoning.","start":393.135,"stop":394.67,"duration":1.54},{"text":"That's the ability to go out and say: This is a use that will occur here, this use won't occur
