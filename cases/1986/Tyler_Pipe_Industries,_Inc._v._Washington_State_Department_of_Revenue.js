Michael Young","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:","start":57.753,"stop":60.539,"duration":2.79},{"text":"These appeals come to the Court from two decisions of the State Supreme Court of Washington.","start":60.539,"stop":66.275,"duration":5.74},{"text":"They involve 72 Appellants, all of whom have paid certain taxes to the state of Washington and are trying to get them back because they believe that the Washington tax statutes are unconstitutional.","start":66.275,"stop":78.666,"duration":12.39},{"text":"71 of the taxpayers were consolidated in the state courts in a case styled National Can Corporation.","start":78.666,"stop":87.022,"duration":8.36},{"text":"These 71 Appellants challenge the Washington taxes as violating the commerce clause on two independent bases: one, that they discriminate against interstate commerce; and two, that they're not fairly apportioned.","start":87.022,"stop":104.9,"duration":17.88},{"text":"Either one of these defects would be a sufficient basis to invalidate the taxes.","start":104.9,"stop":112.637,"duration":7.74},{"text":"I'll address the discrimination problem, and if by any chance my limited time permits I'll also touch on the apportionment problem.","start":112.637,"stop":123.445,"duration":10.81},{"text":"Having granted divided argument, Tyler's counsel will address the issues that are peculiar to that case, which include two commerce clause issues similar to those raised by the National Can Appellants and several other issues that aren't involved in the National Can appeal at all.","start":123.445,"stop":140.99,"duration":17.55},{"text":"The guts or perhaps I should say heart of this case are the taxpayers' activities, the way the Washington taxes are imposed on those activities, and the constitutional problems that they create.","start":140.99,"stop":155.499,"duration":14.51},{"text":"A very graphic picture of the hard facts are provided in the chart that was prepared by the state of Washington, the Appellee here.","start":155.499,"stop":165.439,"duration":9.94},{"text":"And to make the most efficient use of the limited time, I'm going to ask the Court's indulgence in referring with me to the chart that the state prepared.","start":165.439,"stop":176.58,"duration":11.14},{"text":"You'll find it in the jurisdictional statement submitted by National Can Corporation, and in particular it's appendix K to the jurisdictional statement.","start":176.58,"stop":187.72,"duration":11.14},{"text":"So that's on the very last page of the National Can jurisdictional statement, appendix K.","start":187.72,"stop":194.724,"duration":7},{"text":"Now, I want to emphasize, this was prepared by the state and not by us.","start":194.724,"stop":200.362,"duration":5.64},{"text":"It was prepared in a context very much like the one that we're in here.","start":200.362,"stop":205.699,"duration":5.34},{"text":"As you may know, the state participated as an amicus in the Armco versus Hardesty case that was before the Court a couple of years ago.","start":205.699,"stop":215.305,"duration":9.61},{"text":"The state of Washington was trying to help the state of West Virginia defend its taxes, much like these here, against a challenge of unconstitutionality.","start":215.305,"stop":224.743,"duration":9.44},{"text":"But this Court held, after listening to the arguments that the states raised, that the West Virginia taxes were unconstitutional.","start":224.743,"stop":233.266,"duration":8.52},{"text":"And so then the Department of Revenue of Washington had the task of coming back and explaining to the executives of the state and the legislature of the state why this Court reached that conclusion with respect to West Virginia's taxes and why Washington's taxes had the same kinds of problems.","start":233.266,"stop":253.596,"duration":20.33},{"text":"Now, the state in this chart put itself, put the state of Washington, at the top in the large rectangle at the top, and it put the state of West Virginia at the bottom.","start":253.596,"stop":263.286,"duration":9.69},{"text":"I would like to start in the other order because I think it makes sense to start with your decision in the Armco case.","start":263.286,"stop":269.772,"duration":6.49},{"text":"Okay, how does it depict the taxpayers here?","start":269.772,"stop":272.741,"duration":2.97},{"text":"All of the taxpayers in National Can's appeal, like Armco, are manufacturers.","start":272.741,"stop":278.295,"duration":5.55},{"text":"They're producing something.","start":278.295,"stop":280.413,"duration":2.12},{"text":"Almost all of them are manufacturing, a few of them are doing some extracting.","start":280.413,"stop":284.615,"duration":4.2},{"text":"The second thing is that they, like Armco, are selling across state lines.","start":284.615,"stop":290.519,"duration":5.9},{"text":"Now, in each case we're talking about a manufacturer selling.","start":290.519,"stop":296.923,"duration":6.4},{"text":"In this chart the state has chosen to illustrate each activity by one of these small boxes.","start":296.923,"stop":302.577,"duration":5.65},{"text":"So you can see Armco down at the very bottom of the West Virginia chart, manufacturing and wholesaling.","start":302.577,"stop":311.432,"duration":8.86},{"text":"And they're connected with an arrow to indicate that both boxes go together, they're one taxpayer doing these two different activities.","start":311.432,"stop":319.336,"duration":7.9},{"text":"Now, you'll notice running down the center of that chart is kind of a dashed line.","start":319.336,"stop":323.073,"duration":3.74},{"text":"That represents the boundary of the state of West Virginia.","start":323.073,"stop":326.525,"duration":3.45},{"text":"And in Armco's case there, looking at the very bottom set of boxes, you can see that the manufacturing was going on out of state, the wholesaling was going on in West Virginia, and that arrow is crossing the state line.","start":326.525,"stop":342.785,"duration":16.26},{"text":"This Court looked at the fact that Armco was paying West Virginia's wholesaling tax and it compared that situation with a like company doing business entirely within West Virginia.","start":342.785,"stop":355.175,"duration":12.39},{"text":"And that like company in the state's chart here is the top set of boxes in the West Virginia part of the chart there.","start":355.175,"stop":362.615,"duration":7.44},{"text":"You can see that both the manufacturing and wholesaling was going on in West Virginia.","start":362.615,"stop":366.583,"duration":3.97},{"text":"No state boundary is crossed.","start":366.583,"stop":368.869,"duration":2.29},{"text":"The important thing you can see there is that box for wholesaling, if you're an in-state taxpayer, is not cross-hatched, and the fact that it's not cross-hatched, according to the state's symbolism, means it doesn't get taxed.","start":368.869,"stop":382.945,"duration":14.08},{"text":"So the Court looked at a tax on the interstate company wholesaling, no tax on the local company wholesaling, and concluded that there was facial discrimination there.","start":382.945,"stop":395.519,"duration":12.57},{"text":"I'd like to move now to the top of the chart, because that's what really tells us about Washington's taxes.","start":395.519,"stop":401.006,"duration":5.49},{"text":"Up there you'll see a striking similarity.","start":401.006,"stop":405.208,"duration":4.2},{"text":"That shouldn't be very surprising.","start":405.208,"stop":407.81,"duration":2.6},{"text":"In Washington's amicus brief to the Court in Armco, the state representated that its taxes were very similar to those of West Virginia.","start":407.81,"stop":417.535,"duration":9.73},{"text":"You'll see at the very top pair of boxes there local commerce in Washington; again two activities, the same company is manufacturing and it's selling.","start":417.535,"stop":429.592,"duration":12.06},{"text":"But again, only one of those two activities is taxed.","start":429.592,"stop":433.877,"duration":4.29},{"text":"The only difference, really, between the top of the chart and the bottom of the chart is that Washington has reversed its exemption, so in Washington it's the selling that gets taxed, the manufacturing is exempt.","start":433.877,"stop":447.304,"duration":13.43},{"text":"In West Virginia it was the opposite.","start":447.304,"stop":449.637,"duration":2.33},{"text":"Now, I'd invite the Court to compare the situation for that local company with our taxpayers who are before you today.","start":449.637,"stop":459.112,"duration":9.48},{"text":"About a third of those taxpayers are like Kalama Chemical Company, and it's represented by the middle set of boxes there.","start":459.112,"stop":465.849,"duration":6.74},{"text":"It's manufacturing in Washington, it ships what it manufactures across state lines and sells it in other states.","start":465.849,"stop":474.704,"duration":8.86},{"text":"As you can see, Washington imposes on that interstate company the manufacturing tax because it has chosen, instead of refraining from interstate commerce, to sell across state lines.","start":474.704,"stop":488.964,"duration":14.26},{"text":"Another group of our clients are represented by the bottom set of boxes there.","start":488.964,"stop":493.833,"duration":4.87},{"text":"They're in a situation like Xerox Corporation.","start":493.833,"stop":497.737,"duration":3.9},{"text":"They do their manufacturing in some other state, ship the goods across state lines into Washington, and sell them there.","start":497.737,"stop":506.276,"duration":8.54},{"text":"Now, when we looked at the local company, when that local company... when any company manufactures in Washington, it incurs a liability for the tax on manufacturing.","start":506.276,"stop":519.232,"duration":12.96},{"text":"But if it refrains from engaging in interstate commerce, if it will sell the goods in Washington and pay that Washington tax on the selling activity, that company will get a significant tax benefit, an exemption.","start":519.232,"stop":538.029,"duration":18.8},{"text":"It gets a forgiveness of the liability it had already incurred for doing the manufacturing in the state.","start":538.029,"stop":544.266,"duration":6.24}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Young--","start":544.266,"stop":545.351,"duration":1.09}]},{"speakerName":"D.
