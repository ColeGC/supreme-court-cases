that.","start":340.055,"stop":348.577,"duration":8.52},{"text":"This is not a case where we have to separate the regulation and the statute, because they are closely tied.","start":348.577,"stop":353.195,"duration":4.62},{"text":"But I'm trying to point out that there is in 1437(a) a definition of low income housing that includes not only the dwelling, but also embracing the necessary appurtenances thereto.","start":353.195,"stop":365.753,"duration":12.56},{"text":"Now, both before and after Congress passed the Brooke amendment HUD's regulations interpreted specifically or prescribed specifically what tenants were supposed to get for their rent.","start":365.753,"stop":376.395,"duration":10.64},{"text":"And in those regulations, HUD said not only the dwelling, but also the equipment that's included in the dwelling, necessary services, and reasonable amounts of utilities.","start":376.395,"stop":385.751,"duration":9.36},{"text":"That was the standard before and after the Brooke amendment was adopted, and that was the standard that the Housing Authority and the tenants and HUD and everybody agreed on.","start":385.751,"stop":393.856,"duration":8.11},{"text":"So that when the Brooke amendment was adopted, that limitation of 25 percent, now up to 30 percent, of family income that could be charged was to include those things which the Housing Act had previously and was in the future to contemplate being provided in exchange for rent.","start":393.856,"stop":414.353,"duration":20.5},{"text":"It should be no mystery that the Brooke amendment itself doesn't say utilities.","start":414.353,"stop":418.972,"duration":4.62},{"text":"The Brooke amendment doesn't attempt to say what's covered.","start":418.972,"stop":421.507,"duration":2.54},{"text":"It only says what the tenant pays, and what he gets is clear from the other part of the statute and from the regulations.","start":421.507,"stop":429.112,"duration":7.61},{"text":"Now, it was only in 1980 that HUD went beyond its previous approach of non-mandatory guidelines to establish a firm and binding and mandatory regulation that explained how utilities allowances were to be calculated.","start":429.112,"stop":446.074,"duration":16.96},{"text":"And it did so in no uncertain terms, and it made a... it mandated that the housing authorities receiving public housing subsidies begin to implement that regulation immediately, and set an outside deadline of 120 days for doing so.","start":446.074,"stop":463.101,"duration":17.03},{"text":"The regulation provided both procedural steps to be followed in calculating the allowances and it set a substantive standard, the intent being that not more than ten percent of the tenants in a given size of housing unit should have to pay anything more than their 25 percent maximum of income rent in order to enjoy the utilities allowance established.","start":463.101,"stop":488.401,"duration":25.3},{"text":"When that happened, the Housing Authority was duly notified by HUD, as the record shows, and told to implement it not later than 120 days from the date of promulgation, and the Housing Authority simply refused to do it.","start":488.401,"stop":503.244,"duration":14.84},{"text":"The Housing Authority continued to use an allowance of utilities which was so low that they could no longer explain how it was calculated.","start":503.244,"stop":510.766,"duration":7.52},{"text":"And instead of it providing adequately for 90 percent of the tenants, it seems to have resulted in the charging of additional surcharges to 90 to 100 percent of the tenants in most of the sizes of apartments, for most of the quarters.","start":510.766,"stop":524.757,"duration":13.99},{"text":"This state of affairs continued even after the 120 day deadline had passed, even after tenant demands had been made for recalculation, even after the filing of this suit.","start":524.757,"stop":536.149,"duration":11.39},{"text":"So there is simply no question that the Housing Authority in this case simply refused to follow the mandate of HUD.","start":536.149,"stop":543.405,"duration":7.26},{"text":"Now, the tenants complained in the district court that this was illegal and they sued to get their money back that had been collected in excess of their maximum Brooke rent during the period in which these surcharges were in effect.","start":543.405,"stop":560.68,"duration":17.27},{"text":"They sued under both 1983 and under their leases with the Authority.","start":560.68,"stop":565.318,"duration":4.64},{"text":"The Fourth Circuit, focusing chiefly on the 1983 question, found that Congress had intended to preclude such private actions for enforcement, notwithstanding the specificity with which the Brooke amendment identifies the tenants as the beneficiaries, in fact the sole beneficiaries, of the rent limit in that statute.","start":565.318,"stop":587.148,"duration":21.83},{"text":"And the way in which the question was approached I think suggests the weakness of trying to apply uniformly a Cort versus Ash sort of inquiry, because it led to what is definitely a wrong conclusion.","start":587.148,"stop":602.543,"duration":15.39},{"text":"Despite the fact that in this context there is no Congressional express preclusion of private suits... there is nothing in the statute, there is nothing in the legislative history that says private parties may not sue... and despite the absence of any express private remedy effective in these circumstances, such as was present in the Middlesex County Sewerage Authority versus National Sea Clammers case, the Fourth Circuit reached out to find from the very, very modest evidence of the granting of administrative authority to HUD over this program that that represented Congressional intent to preclude a Section 1983 remedy.","start":602.543,"stop":646.638,"duration":44.1},{"text":"Now, when you examine that evidence you have to conclude that this is fairly modest administrative authority even relative to other federal grant programs, such as the AFDC program for instance.","start":646.638,"stop":658.546,"duration":11.91},{"text":"It does not extend, according to HUD itself and to the wording of the statute, to withdrawal of operating subsidies from a noncomplying housing authority, except in very narrow circumstances.","start":658.546,"stop":671.688,"duration":13.14},{"text":"The administrative authority of HUD operates only through the annual contributions contract, and that section of the United States Housing Act which specifies what is to be enforced through the annual contributions contract does not even specify the Brooke amendment.","start":671.688,"stop":691.167,"duration":19.48},{"text":"The Brooke amendment occurs in a different portion of the Act, suggesting that that's not one of the explicit things to which the contributions contract must be addressed.","start":691.167,"stop":701.29,"duration":10.12},{"text":"It is also the case that HUD itself apparently does not believe it has the enforcement authority that the Fourth Circuit ascribes to it here.","start":701.29,"stop":710.796,"duration":9.51},{"text":"While we believe that HUD may be overreading the extent of its lack of power here, HUD has taken the position in several cases which are cited in our brief that it itself has no authority to enforce the Brooke amendment.","start":710.796,"stop":726.507,"duration":15.71},{"text":"That may be extreme, but it certainly appears to be the case that it was not given anywhere in the Act or in its administrative authority over housing authorities an exclusive sort of right to enforce the Act.","start":726.507,"stop":743.783,"duration":17.28},{"text":"The degree to which the Fourth Circuit went astray here suggests to us the importance of returning to a more demanding standard for when a Section 1983 remedy may be precluded.","start":743.783,"stop":760.644,"duration":16.86},{"text":"It is simply too great a derogation of Section 1983 to accept evidence so far afield as that in this case of HUD's authority as evidence of intent to preclude.","start":760.644,"stop":774.552,"duration":13.91},{"text":"Where Congress has expressly established in 1983 a right for individuals to vindicate their federal rights, then we think it should take at least an equally clear expression in the program statute that invests the substantive right to bar the beneficiaries of that substantive program right from exercising the 1983 remedy.","start":774.552,"stop":796.567,"duration":22.01}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, Mr. Woodward, that's assuming that there is a substantive right enforceable
