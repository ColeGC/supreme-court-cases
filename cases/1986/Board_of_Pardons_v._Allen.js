the Respondents, on behalf of themselves and all present and future inmates at the Montana State Prison initiated an action in the United States District Court for the District of Montana alleging in

the Court initially held that the existence of the mere possibility of parole, at least under a state statute, did not give rise to a protected interest.","start":467.421,"stop":479.645,"duration":12.22},{"text":"The rationale for the Court's decision in Greenholtz is especially pertinent to our case.","start":479.645,"stop":487.068,"duration":7.42},{"text":"Because parole decisions depend, as the Court stated in Greenholtz, upon an amalgam of factors some of which are objective but many of which are purely subjective evaluations by Board members based upon their expertise or experience in the difficult and sensitive task of evaluating the advisability of parole release, there is no set of facts which have shown mandates a favorable decision to the inmate.","start":487.068,"stop":522.823,"duration":35.75},{"text":"Stated another way, under a typically worded parole statute in this country an inmate has no legitimate expectation at the outset of the parole application process that a Board will rule favorably upon his application because the nature of the decision making that goes into that determination is so general and so subjective.","start":522.823,"stop":551.059,"duration":28.24},{"text":"Thus, as the Court further noted in Greenholtz, a prisoner has at most a unilateral hope that the benefit sought will be obtained, but not a reasonable expectation of affirmative relief from the involved decision maker.","start":551.059,"stop":572.072,"duration":21.01}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
