review of a denial of a preliminary injunction.","start":255.699,"stop":262.353,"duration":6.65},{"text":"Or, second, that Congress removed, clearly removed the District Court's discretion, In this

the Ninth Circuit said that Weinberger was Inapplicable and therefore did not attempt to determine as Weinberger dictates whether in Section 810 Congress specifically intended to curtail District Court discretion.","start":290.055,"stop":304.799,"duration":14.74},{"text":"Here there is no express language that has been cited nor legislative history to support that proposition.","start":304.799,"stop":311.218,"duration":6.42},{"text":"In fact, in the Senate report to ANILCA which served as the conference reports, cited in our brief at Page 23, the report says that a proposed action may proceed even in the face of findings of potential harm to subsistence resources.","start":311.218,"stop":327.747,"duration":16.53},{"text":"This kind of language hardly meets this Court's requirement of either express intent, express statements, or a necessary and inescapable inference that Congress intended to withdraw traditional equitable discretion from the District Court.","start":327.747,"stop":342.757,"duration":15.01},{"text":"This language and the context of Section 810 is strikingly similar to that of the Clean Water Act reviewed by this Court in Weinberger.","start":342.757,"stop":352.362,"duration":9.61},{"text":"The Clean Water Act also in quite mandatory terms prohibited the discharge of pollutants without a permit.","start":352.362,"stop":359.433,"duration":7.07},{"text":"The Court in Weinberger ruled that an injunction was not required based upon findings of no irreparable harm to water quality in that

here.","start":375.745,"stop":380.965,"duration":5.22},{"text":"But in fact this Court in TVA versus Hill engaged in precisely the sort of inquiry outlined in Weinberger.","start":380.965,"stop":386.952,"duration":5.99},{"text":"The Court expressly found that there would be... that a critical habitat of the small guider, an endangered species in that case, would be destroyed by the closing of the Teleco Dam.","start":386.952,"stop":397.508,"duration":10.56},{"text":"Secondly, the Court ruled at Page 193 of 437 United States Reports, that the finding that the very object of the substantive protections of the Endangered Species Act was going to be extirpated in the words of the Court, didn't necessarily dictate the remedy.","start":397.508,"stop":415.453,"duration":17.94},{"text":"The Court then engaged in an inquiry into the legislative history of the Endangered Species Act and other evidence of Congressional intent to find that Congress explicitly, beyond doubt in the words of the Court, struck the balance in that case in favor of saving this endangered species which was in fact going to be extirpated.","start":415.453,"stop":435.683,"duration":20.23},{"text":"Here, as we have already noted, the District Court found that there would be no harm from exploration activities to subsistence resources in the outer continental shelf off Alaska.","start":435.683,"stop":447.257,"duration":11.57},{"text":"Finally, the factual and statutory context here demonstrates why it is important to examine all the elements in the traditional preliminary injunction test.","start":447.257,"stop":455.847,"duration":8.59},{"text":"The fact, for example, the fact that this action is proceeding under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 is not irrelevant.","start":455.847,"stop":464.036,"duration":8.19},{"text":"First of all, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments bear on the determination of the public interest in an equitable proceeding.","start":464.036,"stop":471.189,"duration":7.15},{"text":"As this Court recognized in Secretary of Interior versus California, Congress intended to promote the expedited exploration of the resources of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the United States Outer Continental Shelf of which two-thirds lies offshore Alaska.","start":471.189,"stop":492.453,"duration":21.26},{"text":"Second, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act bears directly on the remedial calculus here, because as this Court also recognized in Secretary of Interior versus California, Congress explicitly segmented the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act process into discrete stages so that information about resources on the Outer Continental Shelf could be developed without undue risk to environmental or human resources.","start":492.453,"stop":518.503,"duration":26.05},{"text":"Congress made clear that development may never occur on the Outer Continental Shelf without a separate approval and separate environmental analysis before any development plans are approved.","start":518.503,"stop":528.561,"duration":10.06},{"text":"Therefore this structure is indeed directly relevant to determining the necessity and the appropriate scope of an equitable remedy in this case.","start":528.561,"stop":539.084,"duration":10.52},{"text":"The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, is not dispositive with regard to the public interest.","start":539.084,"stop":544.488,"duration":5.4},{"text":"The proper relief in a given case is going to depend on the nature of the harm and the facts and the circumstances before the District Court, Here, as we have noted, subsistence evaluations were made by the Secretary both before the lease sales and then under Section 810 after each of the lease sales here.","start":544.488,"stop":562.116,"duration":17.63},{"text":"The District Court expressly found no harm to subsistence resources from the exploration stage, and also noted that production and development could not occur until there would be further environmental review and further approvals, and also noted that under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act the Secretary of the Interior has the authority to shape and control the outer continental shelf leasing process, including cancelling leases if significant harm to the environment or social harm is presented.","start":562.116,"stop":592.135,"duration":30.02},{"text":"Given all of these circumstances and the ample protection for subsistence here the goals, the statutory goals of Congress in
