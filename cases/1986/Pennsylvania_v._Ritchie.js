Pennsylvania.","start":10.003,"stop":17.959,"duration":7.96},{"text":"The Commonwealth has contended in our brief that the Intermediate appellate court and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania erroneously construed and misapplied two very important segments of the Sixth Amendment jurisprudence of this Court, and in the process effectively have dismantled a very elaborate statutory procedure erected to encourage more complete reporting of what has become a very shameful and often secret crime, the sexual abuse of children.","start":17.959,"stop":50.33,"duration":32.37},{"text":"Specifically, the court below erred, we contend, in concluding that the compulsory process and the confrontation clause invariably requires that a criminal defendant in a sexual offense case such as this must be given pretrial access to confidential records compiled by a child protective service agency notwithstanding the fact that the records were never used or employed by the prosecution at any stage of the proceeding.","start":50.33,"stop":80.516,"duration":30.19},{"text":"Before we address the merits of those contentions, Your Honors, I would request the Court's indulgence in view of the fact that the respondent here has interposed a challenge to this Court's jurisdiction under the so-called final judgment rule it Title 28, USC Section 1257.","start":80.516,"stop":101.013,"duration":20.5},{"text":"In view of that I would like to briefly summarize the factual and the history of this case in order to set the context for argument on that issue.","start":101.013,"stop":111.07,"duration":10.06},{"text":"Respondent was charged in a four-count information with rape, incest, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, and corrupting the morals of children.","start":111.07,"stop":122.343,"duration":11.27},{"text":"The charging document alleged a course of conduct that spans some four years.","start":122.343,"stop":129.282,"duration":6.94},{"text":"The specific criminal episode giving rise to the charges, however, occurred in June of 1979.","start":129.282,"stop":137.536,"duration":8.25},{"text":"Prior to trial, respondent initiated discovery proceedings seeking, among other things, results or reports involving a medical examination counsel believed had taken place regarding the victim in this case.","start":137.536,"stop":154.58,"duration":17.04},{"text":"Subsequently he issued a subpoena to the Children and Youth Services Agency of Allegheny County seeking review and total access to their confidential records pertaining to the victim.","start":154.58,"stop":168.49,"duration":13.91},{"text":"The agency chose not to surrender those records to the respondent based on that subpoena, and as a result respondent's counsel, trial counsel filed a pleading called a motion for sanctions and a hearing was convened at the trial court level.","start":168.49,"stop":187.534,"duration":19.04},{"text":"At the hearing, respondent informed the trial court that he had to have access to these medical records in preparation for trial, and also that he was aware that there had been conversations between the complaining victim and a Children and Youth Services caseworker.","start":187.534,"stop":206.282,"duration":18.75},{"text":"In addition to those alerts, red flags for the court below, respondent's counsel also said that there is possible witnesses, witnesses not known to the defendant.","start":206.282,"stop":220.44,"duration":14.16},{"text":"There could be witnesses in those records that could be useful in my defense, matters that could be favorable to the defendant.","start":220.44,"stop":227.028,"duration":6.59},{"text":"Based on that presentation the trial court denied relief, denied access to these records, and characterized, I think correctly, the assertions or the offer of proof by respondent's trial counsel as too vague and nonspecific.","start":227.028,"stop":247.692,"duration":20.66},{"text":"Of course, as the Court is aware, respondent proceeded to trial, was convicted by a jury, and ultimately sentenced to a term of imprisonment.","start":247.692,"stop":257.38,"duration":9.69},{"text":"The intermediate appellate court of Pennsylvania, the Superior Court, without having considered or having access to the notes of testimony from that pretrial hearing, concluded that the procedures employed by the trial court below failed to protect the respondent's confrontation rights, his privileges there.","start":257.38,"stop":277.878,"duration":20.5},{"text":"A remand was ordered and the trial court was directed to review these records for purposes of determining whether or not there was a statement by the victim pertaining to abuse.","start":277.878,"stop":288.936,"duration":11.06},{"text":"So far so good as far as the commonwealth is concerned.","start":288.936,"stop":293.554,"duration":4.62},{"text":"But inexplicably the court determined that respondent's counsel must be given access to the entire file,
