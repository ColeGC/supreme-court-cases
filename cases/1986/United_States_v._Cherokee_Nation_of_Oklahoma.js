Minear","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1970, this Court decided the case of Choctaw Nation versus Oklahoma.","start":13.058,"stop":21.663,"duration":8.61},{"text":"That decision effectively held that the Cherokee Nation owns an 87-mile portion of the bed of the Arkansas River.","start":21.663,"stop":28.733,"duration":7.07},{"text":"The Cherokee Nation has since sued the United States, claiming that the federal government's navigational improvements on the Arkansas River have damaged the tribe's riverbed properties.","start":28.733,"stop":38.541,"duration":9.81},{"text":"The question in this case is whether the tribe's claims are barred by the United States navigational servitude which permits the government to improve navigable waters free from demands for just compensation.","start":38.541,"stop":50.08,"duration":11.54},{"text":"The government's brief describes the long history of federal navigation improvements on the Arkansas River and the genesis of the present dispute.","start":50.08,"stop":57.836,"duration":7.76},{"text":"Turning directly to the legal question at issue, I will first address the characteristics of the navigational servitude and then explain why the servitude is fully applicable in this case.","start":57.836,"stop":67.624,"duration":9.79},{"text":"It has been well settled since this Court's historic decision in Gibbons v. Ogden that the commerce clause gives Congress broad power to regulate and improve navigable water for the public benefit.","start":67.624,"stop":79.416,"duration":11.79},{"text":"This Court, construing that authority in light of history and the needs of interstate commerce, has developed the concept of the navigational servitude.","start":79.416,"stop":88.372,"duration":8.96},{"text":"This concept has played a vital role in the commercial unification of the country.","start":88.372,"stop":92.942,"duration":4.57},{"text":"The navigational servitude expresses a general understanding that the determination whether federal navigation improvements have taken property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment must take into account the overarching public interest in free navigation.","start":92.942,"stop":107.435,"duration":14.49},{"text":"It recognizes the historic fact that navigable waters are especially valuable as a conduit for trade, and that for this purpose they should be treated as public property of the nation, to be used for the common benefit of all of the nation's constituents, and of particular relevance in the present case, the navigational servitude lays down a firm rule that the United States is not required to pay compensation for damage to in-stream property resulting from federal navigation improvements to naturally navigable rivers.","start":107.435,"stop":137.705,"duration":30.27},{"text":"This Court has repeatedly stated that the owner of land beneath navigable waters has a qualified title, not at its absolute disposal, but to be held at all times subordinate to such use as may be consistent with or demanded by the public right of navigation.","start":137.705,"stop":153.23,"duration":15.52},{"text":"This Court has recognized that principle in a number of cases, but perhaps the best example is Lewis Bluepoint Oyster Company versus Briggs.","start":153.23,"stop":161.253,"duration":8.02},{"text":"In Lewis the plaintiff cultivated oysters on land beneath New York's Great South Bay that was originally conveyed into private hands through a royal patent during the colonial period.","start":161.253,"stop":171.878,"duration":10.63},{"text":"The United States dredged the bay to improve navigation, destroying the plaintiff's oyster beds.","start":171.878,"stop":177.263,"duration":5.39},{"text":"This Court rejected the plaintiff's demand for compensation stating that by necessary implication from the dominant right of navigation, title to submerged land is acquired and held subject to the power of Congress to deepen the water over such lands or to use them for any structure which the interest of navigation may require.","start":177.263,"stop":196.593,"duration":19.33},{"text":"As Lewis indicates, it has long been settled that the United States is not constitutionally obligated to pay compensation when federal navigation improvements impair property within the bed of a naturally navigable body of water.","start":196.593,"stop":210.253,"duration":13.66},{"text":"The same principle is applicable here.","start":210.253,"stop":212.936,"duration":2.68},{"text":"Indeed, when this Court confirmed the Cherokee Nation's riverbed rights in the Choctaw Nation decision, it specifically recognized the tribe was subject to the United States navigational servitude.","start":212.936,"stop":223.911,"duration":10.97},{"text":"The Cherokee Nation nevertheless contends that it should be exempt from the servitude, but there is no basis for creating such an exemption.","start":223.911,"stop":231.667,"duration":7.76},{"text":"The tribe is a part of the United States and is subject just like any of the nation's other constituents to the national government's commerce clause powers.","start":231.667,"stop":240.772,"duration":9.1},{"text":"The Cherokee Nation argued in the District Court that the tribe's quasi-sovereign status provides a basis for an exemption.","start":240.772,"stop":247.759,"duration":6.99},{"text":"We disagree.","start":247.759,"stop":248.794,"duration":1.04},{"text":"Even the states which exercise the full measure of sovereignty allowable under the Constitution are subject to the servitude.","start":248.794,"stop":256.464,"duration":7.67},{"text":"Indian tribes, which have only limited sovereignty but the sufferance of Congress, are not entitled to broader rights than the states possess.","start":256.464,"stop":264.888,"duration":8.42},{"text":"The Cherokee National also claims an exemption on the ground that it received its title through a treaty with and patent from the United States.","start":264.888,"stop":272.994,"duration":8.11},{"text":"However, that fact does not provide the basis for an exemption.","start":272.994,"stop":276.795,"duration":3.8},{"text":"The tribe, like any owner of land beneath navigable waters, took its riverbed interest subject to the federal government's dominant power under the commerce clause to regulate and promote navigation.","start":276.795,"stop":288.836,"duration":12.04},{"text":"The United States did not waive its navigational servitude in the treaty or patent, nor was it obligated to make an express reservation of that sovereign power.","start":288.836,"stop":297.942,"duration":9.11},{"text":"The retention of sovereign authority is implicit in all government agreements unless surrendered in unmistakable terms.","start":297.942,"stop":305.048,"duration":7.11},{"text":"Indeed, as the Lewis case demonstrates, even persons who hold property rights that predate the Union are subject to the servitude.","start":305.048,"stop":311.785,"duration":6.74},{"text":"The tribe suggests that it should be exempt from the servitude because it received fee simple title to the riverbed.","start":311.785,"stop":317.855,"duration":6.07},{"text":"However, the Court's confirmation of the tribe's title in Choctaw Nation was premised in part on the fact that the United States implicitly retained a navigational servitude, and in any event this Court has specifically rejected the contention that fee interests are exempt from the government's long-standing power over navigable waters.","start":317.855,"stop":337,"duration":19.14},{"text":"The tribe also claims an exemption from the servitude based on the United States trust obligations to the tribe.","start":337,"stop":343.423,"duration":6.42},{"text":"The tribe's right to compensation, however, depends on whether it has a compensable property right in the bed of a naturally navigable body of water.","start":343.423,"stop":352.446,"duration":9.02},{"text":"It is well settled under this Court's precedents that no such rights can exist here.","start":352.446,"stop":356.647,"duration":4.2},{"text":"As this Court has stated, the application of the navigational servitude is not an invasion of any private property rights in the streams or the lands underlying it for the damage sustained does not result from the taking of property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment but from the lawful exercise of a power to which the interests of the property owners have always been subject.","start":356.647,"stop":376.977,"duration":20.33},{"text":"The United States trust responsibility may in some circumstances create an obligation to administer whatever property rights that tribe might possess but it cannot create a property right where none would otherwise exist.","start":376.977,"stop":391.487,"duration":14.51},{"text":"At bottom we are dealing here with a doctrine that is clear and well settled.","start":391.487,"stop":396.474,"duration":4.99},{"text":"The United States owes no compensation to any party when the government's navigational improvements impair the private use of lands within the bed of a naturally navigable river.","start":396.474,"stop":406.68,"duration":10.21},{"text":"That doctrine imposes a common burden on all of the nation's constituents for the common good.","start":406.68,"stop":411.984,"duration":5.3},{"text":"It cannot admit a special exception for the Cherokee Tribe.","start":411.984,"stop":415.102,"duration":3.12},{"text":"There is no plausible ground for exempting the tribe uniquely among all of the elements that comprise a national union from an otherwise uniform and unifying national rule.","start":415.102,"stop":425.125,"duration":10.02},{"text":"There are many good reasons why the tribes' request for an exemption should be denied.","start":425.125,"stop":429.196,"duration":4.07},{"text":"The tribe's demand for compensation, if allowed, could amount to a multi-million dollar toll on commerce along the Arkansas River, providing a windfall to the tribe at the public expense.","start":429.196,"stop":440.586,"duration":11.39},{"text":"Furthermore, the recognition of an exception here would be truly remarkable because the Cherokee Nations have been among the historic beneficiaries of navigation improvements on the Arkansas River.","start":440.586,"stop":451.775,"duration":11.19},{"text":"Perhaps most troubling, the creation of an exception in this case may encourage other parties to sue the government, demanding compensation for in-stream damages that were previously considered noncompensable.","start":451.775,"stop":463.433,"duration":11.66},{"text":"This Court should be reluctant to disturb a long-settled constitutional doctrine that has engendered a century of investment-backed reliance.","start":463.433,"stop":470.856,"duration":7.42},{"text":"That is particularly true here where Congress itself has examined the tribe's claim and declined to provide special compensation.","start":470.856,"stop":477.777,"duration":6.92},{"text":"For all of these reasons we suggest that the decision below should be reversed.","start":477.777,"stop":482.246,"duration":4.47},{"text":"Thank you, Your Honors.","start":482.246,"stop":484.03,"duration":1.78}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
