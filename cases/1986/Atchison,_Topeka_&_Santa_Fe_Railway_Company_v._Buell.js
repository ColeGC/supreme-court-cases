statutes to be construed and they are the two that govern relations between employers and employees in the railroad industry.","start":21.061,"stop":29.583,"duration":8.52},{"text":"On the one hand, the Railway Labor Act provides for exclusive mandatory nonjudicial resolution of so-called minor disputes which the Act defines as all disputes growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of bargaining agreements.","start":29.583,"stop":48.462,"duration":18.88},{"text":"The basic objective of this minor dispute part of the Railway Labor Act was to assure that workplace controversies would be resolved by persons who were expert in railroad matters and by processes less cumbersome than courts can offer.","start":48.462,"stop":65.072,"duration":16.61},{"text":"The Federal Employers Liability Act, on the other hand, gives a special federally created remedy against railroads for injuries that they cause.","start":65.072,"stop":75.029,"duration":9.96},{"text":"The problem in this case arises out of the fact that you have one federal statute that precludes a judicial remedy while the other provides a judicial remedy.","start":75.029,"stop":85.82,"duration":10.79},{"text":"Nevertheless, over the 60 years that these two statutes have existed side by side there has been very little conflict between them, and the reason is simple.","start":85.82,"stop":95.276,"duration":9.46},{"text":"So long as the RLA is given, as it usually has been, its traditional usually understood meaning as applying to the resolution of workplace disputes, that is, how the shop ought to be run and what the relationship should be between supervisor and employee, and the FELA on the other hand is given its traditional, usually understood meaning as applying to the redress of physical injuries.","start":95.276,"stop":122.326,"duration":27.05},{"text":"Then there will be few cases, if any, in which courts will have

resolved.","start":130.913,"stop":137.833,"duration":6.92},{"text":"Mr. Buell's grievance against his employer, Santa Fe, really boils down to a disagreement with his foreman, Mr. Wright, over their

principally removing ice and plywood from the yard.","start":150.124,"stop":166.317,"duration":16.19},{"text":"And third, and beyond any question the most important, that his supervisor aid not

appearance.","start":166.317,"stop":184.38,"duration":18.06},{"text":"The first step taken by the respondent and other employees was to initiate RLA grievance procedures on account of Mr. Wright's alleged wrongdoings, and then about a year later Mr. Buell filed this FELA suit alleging that Santa Fe had wrongfully failed to prevent his foreman and his fellow employees from intimidating him, as a result of which he suffered severe mental and emotional injuries.","start":184.38,"stop":210.698,"duration":26.32},{"text":"He did not allege any physical injury.","start":210.698,"stop":213.817,"duration":3.12},{"text":"Several federal courts of appeals and district courts have cautioned against the potential for effectively repealing the Railway Labor Act.","start":213.817,"stop":224.506,"duration":10.69},{"text":"Through what those courts have called artful pleading in drafting personal injury complaints under either the RLA... excuse me, under either the FELA or state law, and ironically the most thoughtful of those opinions comes out of the Ninth Circuit.","start":224.506,"stop":240.3,"duration":15.79},{"text":"This case is the classic

cases.","start":246.538,"stop":251.656,"duration":5.12},{"text":"They arise out of disagreements between an employee and his foreman over the rules of the shop.","start":251.656,"stop":257.928,"duration":6.27},{"text":"Were there in fact conflicting instructions, and if so then which instruction should prevail.","start":257.928,"stop":263.064,"duration":5.14},{"text":"What are the company rules concerning taking scrap plywood home?","start":263.064,"stop":267.718,"duration":4.65},{"text":"And most
