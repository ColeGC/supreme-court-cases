Friday evenings and during the Sabbath hours on Saturday.","start":127.433,"stop":145.477,"duration":18.04},{"text":"This arrangement worked out.","start":145.477,"stop":147.094,"duration":1.62},{"text":"It was, at least according to the immediate supervisor, an acceptable arrangement.","start":147.094,"stop":152.548,"duration":5.45},{"text":"When upper management learned of this accommodation they put a stop to it immediately, gave Paula Hobbie the choice of her job or her religious beliefs.","start":152.548,"stop":164.872,"duration":12.32},{"text":"She refused to give up her religious beliefs.","start":164.872,"stop":168.158,"duration":3.29},{"text":"She refused to

compensation.","start":173.295,"stop":175.747,"duration":2.45},{"text":"The employer objected, the state agreed, and she was denied unemployment compensation for misconduct associated with her work.","start":175.747,"stop":185.52,"duration":9.77},{"text":"She took an appeal to the Fifth District Appellate Court in Florida.","start":185.52,"stop":190.839,"duration":5.32},{"text":"The court there affirmed the Florida Unemployment Appeals Commission decision denying her unemployment compensation, and she has brought the case here today.","start":190.839,"stop":202.064,"duration":11.22},{"text":"There are a number of factual and legal parallels between Hobbie and this Court's decisions in Sherbert and Thomas.","start":202.064,"stop":210.753,"duration":8.69},{"text":"Hobbie, like Sherbert and Thomas, was denied unemployment compensation by the state.","start":210.753,"stop":217.324,"duration":6.57},{"text":"Hobbie, like Sherbert and Thomas, was asked or forced to choose between her religion and/or her work.","start":217.324,"stop":227.798,"duration":10.47},{"text":"Hobbie, like Sherbert and Thomas, was put into a situation where work once acceptable for religious reasons became objectionable, and

once again has brought pressure to bear on her to modify her religious beliefs.","start":244.308,"stop":255.449,"duration":11.14},{"text":"The holding in Sherbert and Thomas reached an important, we believe, milestone in free exercise jurisprudence.","start":255.449,"stop":265.572,"duration":10.12},{"text":"The compelling state interest standard was applied to the free exercise of religion, and

converted and adopted her religious practices after she began her employment, that that act of conversion, that act which is so fundamental to a free exercise right, distinguishes her situation from Sherbert and from Thomas and thus disqualifies her from entitlements to the benefits under the state's unemployment compensation program.","start":308,"stop":336.936,"duration":28.94},{"text":"We would suggest that such a distinction is not a valid one and that the principles in Sherbert and Thomas should control.","start":336.936,"stop":346.125,"duration":9.19},{"text":"To allow the agent of change to become a defense would in effect deny a person at any time from converting to new religious beliefs and practices, and of course that right of conversion, that right to adopt a new religion,
