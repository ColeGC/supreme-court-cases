question.","start":605.195,"stop":612.036,"duration":6.84},{"text":"Now, there's no doubt that the burden here on the individual is indeed a heavy burden.","start":612.036,"stop":618.673,"duration":6.64},{"text":"And there is no doubt, therefore, that the government bears a weighty burden of justifications.","start":618.673,"stop":625.342,"duration":6.67},{"text":"Now, the respondents argue that no justification will work; that no justification is sufficient to permit the detention on

competent, time of peace, citizen not alien... what this line represents is a compendium of all of this Court's cases in which it was said that regulatory detention would be permissible.","start":642.492,"stop":662.858,"duration":20.37},{"text":"And it's not surprising, since this is a new scheme, and the Court granted certiorari to decide an issue it has not previously decided, that the line so drawn will not pass through this case.","start":662.858,"stop":677.696,"duration":14.84},{"text":"But the principles of this Court, we think, plainly dispose of this issue.","start":677.696,"stop":684.366,"duration":6.67},{"text":"The Court of Appeals and the respondents do, I think, raise a serious and important issue about detention as regulation.","start":684.366,"stop":694.908,"duration":10.54},{"text":"They are concerned that what is undoubtedly a regulatory scheme here should not oust the familiar constitutionally structured

be.","start":694.908,"stop":718.789,"duration":23.88},{"text":"The picture, I suppose, that worries them is the world of the novel of the Clockwork Orange, or what happens in some other countries,

concerns.","start":732.8,"stop":743.95,"duration":11.15},{"text":"Now, I confess that these anomalies and this concern makes me nervous too, as does the idea of displacing the criminal law as the
