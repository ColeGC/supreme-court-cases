Court:","start":643.234,"stop":648.572,"duration":5.34},{"text":"This is, it seems to me, a case that brings to the Court a First Amendment religious clause challenge to legislative action in perhaps its cleanest and simplest form.","start":648.572,"stop":659.363,"duration":10.79},{"text":"Congress has barred religious discrimination in employment decisions under Title VII, but in so doing it has elected in Section 702 to exempt from that prohibition religious organizations, associations, institutions and corporations.","start":659.363,"stop":675.705,"duration":16.34},{"text":"Rather than imposing certain obligations on employers in order to accommodate a particular religious view which was the case with the Connecticut statutes struck down in Thornton and Caldor, what Congress here has done is imposed no obligation on religious employers in the interest of religious accommodation.","start":675.705,"stop":696.386,"duration":20.68},{"text":"In essence, it has adopted a hands-off policy with regard to religious-based employment decisions of religious organizations.","start":696.386,"stop":705.844,"duration":9.46},{"text":"As stated, and indeed the uniformly recognized purpose for leaving religious institutions alone, was Congress' desire to avoid governmental control over and entanglement with the affairs and activities of religious organizations.","start":705.844,"stop":723.738,"duration":17.89},{"text":"As the court below correctly found, this satisfies the secular purpose requirement of Walz and Gillette and the like cases of this Court.","start":723.738,"stop":733.161,"duration":9.42},{"text":"Section 702 exemption removes the prospect of intrusive and likely constitutionally-offensive inquiry, investigation and probing by government into the religious or the secular nature of church-related activities.","start":733.161,"stop":750.64,"duration":17.48},{"text":"On another level, the exemption eliminates the prospect of secular control over and entanglement with the church's ability to fulfill its religious mission.","start":750.64,"stop":762.013,"duration":11.37},{"text":"There is thus no tension here between the religious accommodation requirement that's incorporated in the free exercise clause and the establishment clause's prohibition against state endorsement or advancement of religion.","start":762.013,"stop":776.69,"duration":14.68},{"text":"Rather, Congress' hands-off approach brings the values of both the free exercise clause and the establishment clause into perfect harmony.","start":776.69,"stop":785.463,"duration":8.77},{"text":"The exemption from an intrusive government regulation furthers the free exercise interest by preserving the liberty of religious organizations to create and exert authority over self-defining religious communities, and for much the same reason, it furthers the establishment clause's interest in avoiding undue secular control and entanglement.","start":785.463,"stop":808.559,"duration":23.1},{"text":"It cannot be, as Appellants argue, that disharmonization fails in First Amendment terms, because Congress' accommodation of religion is broader in this instance than might be required or compelled by the free exercise clause.","start":808.559,"stop":826.54,"duration":17.98},{"text":"Any narrower exemption, whether defined along the lines suggested by the court below or in some other fashion, would of necessity bring into play the kind of line drawing on secular terms that would exacerbate the very tension between the two religious clauses that Congress effectively avoided in Section 702.","start":826.54,"stop":848.286,"duration":21.75},{"text":"Indeed, it's precisely for this reason that this Court in Walz and other decisions has acknowledged that there is considerable room between the floor set by the free exercise clause and the ceiling that's erected by the establishment clause in which legislatures may chart their own course of benevolent neutrality.","start":848.286,"stop":868.533,"duration":20.25},{"text":"That Congress safely navigated a neutral course in Section 702 is quite clear.","start":868.533,"stop":875.02,"duration":6.49},{"text":"The exemption applies to all religions even handedly, not to a particular sect or to select religions.","start":875.02,"stop":881.973,"duration":6.95},{"text":"It involves no endorsement of, financial support for, or active involvement in religious affairs by government.","start":881.973,"stop":890.529,"duration":8.56},{"text":"In this regard, the wall between church and state has not been breached.","start":890.529,"stop":895.183,"duration":4.65},{"text":"Religion is neither enhanced nor inhibited by the Section 702 exemption.","start":895.183,"stop":901.337,"duration":6.15},{"text":"Now, Appellees have argued that the statute effectively grants religious employers a benefit, that is, to discriminate on account of religion, which is unavailable to non-religious employers but this is the inevitable consequence of a hands-off policy by the Governemnt in First Amendment matters.","start":901.337,"stop":921.75,"duration":20.41},{"text":"It allows religious institutions to advance their own religious mission on their own terms and through their own

sort constitutionally protected by the Free Exercise clause.","start":970.731,"stop":983.991,"duration":13.26},{"text":"Here, Congress acted to preserve the autonomy of religious institutions to manage their own affairs with respect to matters of religious employment.","start":983.991,"stop":993.597,"duration":9.61},{"text":"In fashioning a broad exemption, Congress emphatically removed from
