Court:","start":12.276,"stop":16.838,"duration":4.56},{"text":"If the State of Georgia had criminal statutes that expressly imposed different penalties, harsher penalties, on black defendants simply because they were black, or on those who killed white victims, simply because those victims were white, the statutes would plainly violate the Constitution.","start":16.838,"stop":37.298,"duration":20.46},{"text":"There was a time, of course, when the State of Georgia did have such statutes, before our nation's Civil War, when free blacks and slaves alike could be given a death sentence merely for the crime of assault on a Georgia white citizen.","start":37.298,"stop":50.87,"duration":13.57},{"text":"With the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, such criminal statutes came explicitly no longer to be written.","start":50.87,"stop":57.962,"duration":7.09},{"text":"Yet the old habits of mind, the racial attitudes of that time have survived, as this Court well knows, into the current century.","start":57.962,"stop":67.27,"duration":9.31},{"text":"Today, we are before the Court with a substantial body of evidence indicating that during the last decade Georgia prosecutors and juries, in their administration of Georgia's post-Furman capital statutes, have continued to act as if some of those old statutes were still on the books.","start":67.27,"stop":88.263,"duration":20.99},{"text":"A black defendant convicted in the State of Georgia of the murder of a white person goes to his sentencing hearing with as serious a handicap against him on racial grounds alone as if the prosecutor had hard evidence that he had been tried and convicted previously of another murder.","start":88.263,"stop":107.378,"duration":19.11},{"text":"The color of a defendant's skin, in other words, or that of his victim, is often as grave an aggravating circumstance, in fact, in Georgia, as those expressly designated by Georgia's legislature.","start":107.378,"stop":121.889,"duration":14.51},{"text":"We've documented below the role that's been played by racial considerations in Georgia's capital sentencing system.","start":121.889,"stop":129.042,"duration":7.15},{"text":"Our evidence demonstrates that Georgia sentences the killers of its white citizens at a rate nearly eleven times that to which it sentences to death the killers of its black citizens.","start":129.042,"stop":142.504,"duration":13.46},{"text":"And even after most of the legitimate sentencing considerations had been taken into account, a defendant remains over four times likely to receive a capital sentence if his victim chanced to be white.","start":142.504,"stop":157.343,"duration":14.84},{"text":"Now the sources of petitioner's evidence below are two meticulous studies.","start":157.343,"stop":162.356,"duration":5.01},{"text":"They were conducted by Professors David Baldus and George Woodworth.","start":162.356,"stop":166.136,"duration":3.78},{"text":"And they have two major strengths that I think the Court should focus on at the outset.","start":166.136,"stop":171.4,"duration":5.26},{"text":"The first strength is their comprehensiveness.","start":171.4,"stop":175.383,"duration":3.98},{"text":"They provide us with a thorough picture of how the Georgia capital sentencing system operated during the 1973-1979 period covered by the studies.","start":175.383,"stop":187.112,"duration":11.73},{"text":"The second feature of these studies is the extraordinary openness of Professors Baldus and Woodworth.","start":187.112,"stop":193.953,"duration":6.84},{"text":"Their indefatigable willingness to entertain every criticism, to test every rival hypothesis, to seize upon every statistical means known to them to take their racial findings and shake them hard and see if by some statistical means or method, those findings would drop out of their analysis.","start":193.953,"stop":215.632,"duration":21.68},{"text":"In other words, Professor Baldus was not wedded at the outset to any assumptions about what he wanted to prove.","start":215.632,"stop":223.285,"duration":7.65},{"text":"He was open to all comers.","start":223.285,"stop":225.222,"duration":1.94},{"text":"He was open to the state.","start":225.222,"stop":226.737,"duration":1.51},{"text":"He was open to the court.","start":226.737,"stop":227.941,"duration":1.2},{"text":"Indeed, during our evidentiary hearing in 1983, he invited the District Judge, please sir, you designate for us those factors you think make a difference in Georgia.","start":227.941,"stop":238.797,"duration":10.86},{"text":"You tell us a statistical method.","start":238.797,"stop":241.296,"duration":2.5},{"text":"We will with our computer here run that model.","start":241.296,"stop":244.795,"duration":3.5},{"text":"We will see whether in the test before the court we're right that race plays a part, or not.","start":244.795,"stop":251.79,"duration":7},{"text":"The judge accepted that test.","start":251.79,"stop":253.759,"duration":1.97},{"text":"The data were run under his model.","start":253.759,"stop":256.382,"duration":2.62},{"text":"And indeed, the racial effects, as Judge Forester saw the system in Georgia, actually increased.","start":256.382,"stop":262.537,"duration":6.15},{"text":"It's because Professor Baldus was wedded to no prior assumptions; it's because he subjected his statistical analysis to so many varieties of review; that his studies provide, I believe, such a powerful indictment of the Georgia system.","start":262.537,"stop":279.875,"duration":17.34},{"text":"Now, one would suppose that the State of Georgia, faced with this serious challenge to the administration of its capital statutes, would have come forth with some explanation for these racial disparities.","start":279.875,"stop":291.62,"duration":11.75},{"text":"That's the conventional pattern in these equal protection cases or Eighth Amendment cases.","start":291.62,"stop":296.541,"duration":4.92},{"text":"Some legitimate reason that might demonstrate that what appear to be racial disparities, racial discrimination, actually is something more benign operating in the system.","start":296.541,"stop":307.49,"duration":10.95},{"text":"But Georgia did not take this step, either in the year of discovery that preceded our 1983 hearing, or during that hearing itself, or even in the three years that this case has wended its way up on appeal.","start":307.49,"stop":320.515,"duration":13.02},{"text":"The state certainly has not offered any rational state interest that would justify racial discrimination in itself.","start":320.515,"stop":327.528,"duration":7.01},{"text":"But neither has the state offered any legitimate sentencing considerations that if taken into account would diminish the apparent role of race.","start":327.528,"stop":336.369,"duration":8.84},{"text":"It has not come forward, as you suggested last term, in the Bazemore case, would be appropriate, with other statistical models to make race go away.","start":336.369,"stop":344.976,"duration":8.61},{"text":"Instead, Georgia's sole response has been narrowly technical and methodological.","start":344.976,"stop":351.286,"duration":6.31},{"text":"It has launched an attack on our data sources.","start":351.286,"stop":354.393,"duration":3.11},{"text":"It has questioned the value of modern statistical analysis in this area.","start":354.393,"stop":358.548,"duration":4.16},{"text":"And it has sought a technical legal rule.","start":358.548,"stop":362.109,"duration":3.56},{"text":"It has sought to obtain in this one area, the area of capital sentencing, a standard of proof so high that it has no peer anywhere else in the law.","start":362.109,"stop":371.261,"duration":9.15},{"text":"Now, its first attack on petitioner's data sources has a kind of a keen irony to it, because of course, as you know from the briefs, Professor Baldus and his colleagues drew their information from Georgia's own official files, from its police reports, from its prosecutors' statements, from its trial transcripts, from its records in the Supreme Court of Georgia.","start":371.261,"stop":392.566,"duration":21.3},{"text":"These are the very record that Georgia uses to prosecute capital
