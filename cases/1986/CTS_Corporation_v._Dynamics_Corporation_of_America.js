DCA, the Seventh Circuit, or even the United States has identified for this Court a constitutionally cognizable line that says on the one hand, the control share acquisition statute impermissibly

for mergers, provisions for staggered boards, or even the ability to vote annually for directors or a class of directors do not.","start":545.28,"stop":582.547,"duration":37.27},{"text":"If the Court

exclusively intrastate or in interstate commerce.","start":654.844,"stop":663.326,"duration":8.48},{"text":"That bundle of rights inherent in a share of stock governs everything from the value on liquidation and dissolution, the rights to dividends, if any, the ability to participate in shareholders meetings, if at all, the amount of that participation, and the kinds of issues in which

conditions.","start":663.326,"stop":691.267,"duration":27.94},{"text":"The very existence and nature of voting rights is solely a function of the chartering state's law, whether the share of stock is

commerce.","start":707.933,"stop":713.961,"duration":6.03},{"text":"State law, not federal law, still governs the voting rights.","start":713.961,"stop":718.553,"duration":4.59},{"text":"And to date no one has suggested, at least directly that, one share, one vote, has been imposed on the chartering state's law by the commerce clause.","start":718.553,"stop":728.486,"duration":9.93},{"text":"Indeed, to the contrary, one only has to remember that under the common law it was the shareholder who had one vote, not vote based on the number of shares.","start":728.486,"stop":738.811,"duration":10.33},{"text":"Delaware has chartered corporations where it was possible under the articles of incorporation for a person to have declining voting rights as the share power increased.","start":738.811,"stop":750.338,"duration":11.53},{"text":"As the United States at least recognizes, necessarily there will be so-called extraterritorial effects of the chartering state's law because the benefits and burdens constitutionally must follow the stock wherever it goes.","start":750.338,"stop":767.251,"duration":16.91},{"text":"Thus, and pursuant to a chartering state's statutory merger procedure, the will of the majority or super-majority of the shareholders is that a merger not occur, then it will not occur even though the practical effect is to stop a New York corporation from acquiring an Indiana corporation and stopping a shareholder from California from selling... the ability to sell shares.","start":767.251,"stop":791.336,"duration":24.09},{"text":"Indeed, under the merger statutes, if the directors don't even submit the proposal to the shareholders at all, the shareholders never get the right to vote at all.","start":791.336,"stop":801.207,"duration":9.87},{"text":"No one, not DCA, not the Seventh Circuit, not even the United States, has suggested that such a merger statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce, even though it quite obviously potentially stops the interstate, international commerce of control.","start":801.207,"stop":819.138,"duration":17.93},{"text":"Even though the United States concedes the fundamental premises on which the CTS argument rests, it nonetheless argues that the statute is unconstitutional under the commerce clause because its provisions on voting rights are triggered by purchase and sale, what they call transactions involving shares, and although there is no facial discrimination between interstate and intrastate commerce, most of these transactions as they are called would take place in interstate commerce and the statute preserves whatever pattern of voting rights exists at a given time against transactions that would alter that pattern in significant ways.","start":819.138,"stop":860.964,"duration":41.83},{"text":"But each of the United States' points is refuted either by decisions of this Court, or its own argument.","start":860.964,"stop":868.774,"duration":7.81},{"text":"That there can be transactions at all is purely a function of state law.","start":868.774,"stop":873.913,"duration":5.14},{"text":"This Court squarely held that in Aldridge.","start":873.913,"stop":876.693,"duration":2.78},{"text":"Transferability of shares in a corporation stems from state law.","start":876.693,"stop":882.894,"duration":6.2},{"text":"Characterizing the triggering event for application of the statute as a \"transaction\" adds nothing to the analysis.","start":882.894,"stop":893.389,"duration":10.5},{"text":"The easiest way to demonstrate that for the Court's purposes is to take a look at the partnership laws.","start":893.389,"stop":899.934,"duration":6.54},{"text":"Again, partnerships are creatures of states.","start":899.934,"stop":902.745,"duration":2.81},{"text":"State laws inherently say, virtually without exception, you cannot transfer the voting power inherent in a unit of a limited partnership or inherent in a general partnership interest without the agreement of somebody else, either the general partners or the limited partners as the case may be.","start":902.745,"stop":924.3,"duration":21.55},{"text":"If this statute falls on that basis, likewise every partnership law has to fall on the same basis because those are transactions where the economic benefits are transferred and the voting rights are, to use the term so often used by the other side and by the Court, stripped by virtue of the transaction.","start":924.3,"stop":943.353,"duration":19.05},{"text":"To bring it home, one of the hottest products hitting the intrastate market today is units in master limited partnerships.","start":943.353,"stop":952.49,"duration":9.14},{"text":"No one can seriously contend that state partnership laws violate the commerce clause because the voting rights are stripped away, even though that's plainly an interstate commerce kind of transaction.","start":952.49,"stop":965.814,"duration":13.32},{"text":"The United States argument says that most transactions occur in interstate commerce, but that likewise adds little to the analysis.","start":965.814,"stop":978.839,"duration":13.03},{"text":"This Court has totally refuted a disproportionate impact theory in its decision in Exxon and in its decision in Commonwealth Edison Co. versus Montana in which this Court upheld direct burdens which fell disproportionately on interstate commerce.","start":978.839,"stop":996.16,"duration":17.32},{"text":"Morever, if there is an impermissible disproportionate impact arising from the control share acquisition statute, that must be
