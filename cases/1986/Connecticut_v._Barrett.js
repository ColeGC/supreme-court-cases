Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":56.92,"stop":59.622,"duration":2.7},{"text":"The respondent in this case, William Barrett, was arrested on a charge of sexual assault.","start":59.622,"stop":65.692,"duration":6.07},{"text":"Shortly after his arrest, within a matter of hours, he was given four separate sets of Miranda warnings.","start":65.692,"stop":71.929,"duration":6.24},{"text":"He told police officers that he had no problem talking about the incident, but he would not give a written statement without an attorney.","start":71.929,"stop":80.635,"duration":8.71},{"text":"The question presented in this case is whether an oral statement given by the respondent is admissible as evidence in the subsequent criminal trial.","start":80.635,"stop":89.724,"duration":9.09},{"text":"As I just indicated, Mr. Barrett was arrested on a charge of sexual assault.","start":89.724,"stop":95.462,"duration":5.74},{"text":"At the time of his arrest he was warned in accordance with Miranda versus Arizona.","start":95.462,"stop":99.997,"duration":4.53},{"text":"He was then transported to a nearly town.","start":99.997,"stop":104.233,"duration":4.24},{"text":"Upon arriving he was again given his Miranda warnings.","start":104.233,"stop":109.135,"duration":4.9},{"text":"He received a third set of Miranda warnings prior to the actual interrogation.","start":109.135,"stop":114.339,"duration":5.2},{"text":"The Connecticut trial court and the Connecticut Supreme Court both found that the defendant stated he had no problem talking to the officers but he would not give a written statement without an attorney.","start":114.339,"stop":125.897,"duration":11.56},{"text":"Mr. Barrett then proceeded to give a narrative account of the incident, admitting that he and his co-defendant had intercourse with their victim.","start":125.897,"stop":136.789,"duration":10.89},{"text":"He claimed, however, that this was a consensual act, despite the fact that during the act he had in his hands a screwdriver.","start":136.789,"stop":147.06,"duration":10.27},{"text":"The police had unsuccessfully attempted to tape record the defendant's first statement.","start":147.06,"stop":152.464,"duration":5.4},{"text":"In an effort to get a valid tape recording of this statement, they once again advised Mr. Barrett of his Miranda rights.","start":152.464,"stop":159.654,"duration":7.19},{"text":"Again the defendant repeated that he had no problem talking with the officers but he would not give a written statement in the absence of counsel.","start":159.654,"stop":168.141,"duration":8.49},{"text":"The defendant then proceeded to give a narrative account paralleling the first account.","start":168.141,"stop":175.264,"duration":7.12},{"text":"At trial the defendant contended that his two statements were involuntary.","start":175.264,"stop":180.234,"duration":4.97},{"text":"However, at the conclusion of a suppression hearing the trial court held that the defendant had made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to remain silent.","start":180.234,"stop":189.756,"duration":9.52},{"text":"Therefore, the two statements were both introduced.","start":189.756,"stop":193.208,"duration":3.45},{"text":"On appeal, Mr. Barrett again contended that the statements were involuntary, but he added the contention that the statements were taken in violation of Edwards versus Arizona.","start":193.208,"stop":204.599,"duration":11.39},{"text":"The trial court's factual finding was basically not challenged by the Connecticut Supreme Court.","start":204.599,"stop":212.622,"duration":8.02},{"text":"Instead, that Court held that the defendant's refusal to give a written statement without an attorney present was a clear request for the assistance of counsel to protect his Fifth Amendment rights.","start":212.622,"stop":225.263,"duration":12.64},{"text":"In reaching this conclusion the Connecticut Supreme Court never considered the fact that the defendant had not invoked his right to remain silent for purposes of that oral interrogation.","start":225.263,"stop":236.987,"duration":11.72},{"text":"Thus, the Connecticut Supreme Court misconstrued this Court's holding in Miranda and in Edwards.","start":236.987,"stop":246.943,"duration":9.96},{"text":"This Court has consistently made it clear that the purpose of the Miranda warnings is to dispel that coercion that is inherent in police interrogation.","start":246.943,"stop":256.615,"duration":9.67},{"text":"Additionally, Miranda is designed to assure that a suspect in police custody is adequately advised of his Fifth Amendment rights prior to giving any statements.","start":256.615,"stop":267.507,"duration":10.89},{"text":"Custodial interrogation was viewed as inherently coercive.","start":267.507,"stop":272.577,"duration":5.07},{"text":"However, under the Miranda holdings, holdings, once a suspect has been adequately advised, it is possible for a trial court to find that that suspect did in fact waive his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and that waiver was an act of free will.","start":272.577,"stop":290.122,"duration":17.55},{"text":"The state does acknowledge that there is a bright line if a defendant does request counsel at the interrogation.","start":290.122,"stop":300.894,"duration":10.77}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mrs. Dewey, what if a defendant or the defendant in this case in this case refused to sign a written confession because of a belief that only written statements could be introduced in evidence against him?","start":300.894,"stop":325.026,"duration":24.13}]},{"speakerName":"Julia Dicocco Dewey","textObjs":[{"text":"Justice O'Connor, I don't believe that this Court has every held that the individual knowledge of a defendant or suspect, a knowledge that's not communicated to the police officers, would have any bearing on whether there was a free and voluntary act by the defendant.","start":325.026,"stop":341.221,"duration":16.19},{"text":"Of course, at a suppression hearing that would become a factor that would be considered by the trial court.","start":341.221,"stop":346.007,"duration":4.79}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"The trial court would have to determine, would it not, that the respondent knowingly gave us his right, understanding that the statements could be used against him?","start":346.007,"stop":361.901,"duration":15.89}]},{"speakerName":"Julia Dicocco Dewey","textObjs":[{"text":"It would still be a factual determination for the trial court, if evidence of that nature came before the trial court at a suppression hearing.","start":361.901,"stop":368.888,"duration":6.99}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you think that when someone, a defendant, makes a waiver of this type which is selective or perhaps conditional, that that suggests that there may be some uncertainty on the part of the defendant about what statements can be used against him?","start":368.888,"stop":391.152,"duration":22.26}]},{"speakerName":"Julia Dicocco Dewey","textObjs":[{"text":"A selective or conditional waiver has never been held to be an equivocal or an ambiguous situation.","start":391.152,"stop":397.621,"duration":6.47},{"text":"It could be a factor--","start":397.621,"stop":399.823,"duration":2.2}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I didn't ask or suggest that it was ambiguous, but, does it possibly suggest a lack of knowledge of how the statements could be used?","start":399.823,"stop":413.167,"duration":13.34}]},{"speakerName":"Julia Dicocco Dewey","textObjs":[{"text":"--Under the facts of particular case, it might be possible theta selective waiver, if it were somehow inherently inconsistent, could suggest a lack of knowledge or could suggest that the defendant did not truly comprehend his Miranda rights.","start":413.167,"stop":427.927,"duration":14.76},{"text":"But again, that would be a factual determination for the trial court, and in this particular case the determination by the trial court was that that waiver, that selective waiver, was not an indication of an indication of a right to counsel or any uncertainty, but rather that the defendant was so aware of what his rights were that he chose to exercise some of the rights but not the other.","start":427.927,"stop":450.856,"duration":22.93},{"text":"He chose not to have counsel present for the oral aspect, as opposed to the written aspect of the interrogation.","start":450.856,"stop":461.295,"duration":10.44},{"text":"In the present case the Connecticut Supreme Court applied the Edwards rationale in a vacuum.","start":461.295,"stop":467.032,"duration":5.74}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Excuse me.","start":467.032,"stop":467.432,"duration":0.4},{"text":"Before you what if in fact he had been under the misperception that anything that he said orally couldn't be used and only the material that he subscribed to in writing could be used.","start":467.432,"stop":484.493,"duration":17.06},{"text":"Then what would the result be?","start":484.493,"stop":486.862,"duration":2.37}]},{"speakerName":"Julia Dicocco Dewey","textObjs":[{"text":"The result should be same as was held by the Connecticut trial court.","start":486.862,"stop":490.897,"duration":4.03},{"text":"The fact that the defendant, or the suspect, hasn't made a shrewd choice once advised of his Miranda rights does not bar the subsequent admission of that statement that the defendant subsequently makes.","start":490.897,"stop":503.991,"duration":13.09},{"text":"An ill-advised choice, an ill choice, rather; a shrewd choice, a choice not in the defendant's interest is not what Miranda was designed to protect.","start":503.991,"stop":511.911,"duration":7.92},{"text":"Miranda was just designed to assure that the defendant was in fact advised.","start":511.911,"stop":517.731,"duration":5.82}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, was advised and he said he understood it, but in fact he didn't understand it if he thought that anything he said orally couldn't be used against him.","start":517.731,"stop":526.82,"duration":9.09}]},{"speakerName":"Julia Dicocco Dewey","textObjs":[{"text":"But in the present case, the defendant himself testified that he did understand the Miranda rights and he did understand that what was said could be used against him.","start":526.82,"stop":534.343,"duration":7.52},{"text":"He and the officers had also testified that in their perception the defendant understood what the Miranda rights entailed.","start":534.343,"stop":543.332,"duration":8.99},{"text":"So, in this case there is no question.","start":543.332,"stop":544.982,"duration":1.65}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin
