Blockburger, Gore and Greene, this case does not involve the order form statute.","start":26.105,"stop":34.601,"duration":8.5},{"text":"The only statutes involved in this case are the Stamp Act requirement statute and the illegal import statute.","start":34.601,"stop":46.178,"duration":11.58},{"text":"The question, primary question for consideration is whether under a charge of purchasing narcotic drugs from an unstamped package, and receiving and concealing the same drugs, known that the drugs have been illegally imported, a defendant may be given consecutive sentences under proof of mere possession and under instructions which do not try to distinguish the elements of one statute from the elements in the other statute.","start":46.178,"stop":89.125,"duration":42.95},{"text":"Now, Section 4704 of Title 26 not only makes sale an offense, it makes purchase, sale, dispensing and distributing drugs, except in original stamped packages, a crime and that statute has a presumption which provides that the absence of stamps is prima facie evidence of a violation by the person in whose possession the narcotic drug may be found.","start":89.125,"stop":128.306,"duration":39.18},{"text":"The other statute involved is the import statute which makes it a crime to either import or receive, conceal, buy, sell, or in any manner facilitate the transportation, concealment or sale of narcotic drugs after import knowing that the drugs have been illegally imported.","start":128.306,"stop":152.962,"duration":24.66},{"text":"Again, there is a presumption which provides that possession of the narcotic drugs shall be sufficient evidence to constitute a --

the Government's case, the evidence in the Government's case show that there were two police officers standing on cans peered into windows of an apartment and they saw three

room and this alibi naturally was rejected by the jury.","start":263.781,"stop":276.243,"duration":12.46},{"text":"Now, the instructions are very important in this case and they are set out on -- the pertinent instructions are set out on page 7, 8 and 9 of our brief.","start":276.243,"stop":293.35,"duration":17.11},{"text":"In this particular case, the Court instructed the jury by first reading the statutes involved.","start":293.35,"stop":301.668,"duration":8.32},{"text":"They next instructed the jury by reading the presumptions.","start":301.668,"stop":305.717,"duration":4.05},{"text":"He then read each count of the indictment.","start":305.717,"stop":308.01,"duration":2.29},{"text":"Then the Court immediately after reading each count of the indictment said, “So, the question under each count of this indictment resolves down to whether or not the defendants or either of them did possess this narcotic drug on the 8th day of February, of this year, out there in the room at 4567 McMillan.”","start":308.01,"stop":329.447,"duration":21.44},{"text":"Then the Court stated that under Count 1 that possession was prima facie evidence and significantly, the Court said, this is on page 8 of our brief, “So if you find and believe from all the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants or either of them possessed the narcotics mentioned in Count 1 and that the said narcotics did not bear the required internal revenue tax stamps, then you will find the defendants or either of them guilty as charged in Count 1.”","start":329.447,"stop":364.681,"duration":35.23},{"text":"Then the Court gave a similar instruction under -- for Count 2, the difference being instead of saying that you will find the defendants guilty, the Court said that possession would authorize -- would authorize the conviction of the defendants under Count 2.","start":364.681,"stop":381.731,"duration":17.05},{"text":"Then the Court went on to say that unless you find that the defendants had possession, that you must acquit the defendants.","start":381.731,"stop":392.326,"duration":10.6},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals affirmed on a theory that the single act of possession justified cumulative sentence -- sentences and that the Court instructed the -- trial court instructed the jury as to the necessary elements required for a -- for a conviction.","start":392.326,"stop":416.028,"duration":23.7},{"text":"Now, the first problem involved is, what did the Blockburger and Gore cases hold?","start":416.028,"stop":425.557,"duration":9.53},{"text":"In Blockburger, there was a sale involving -- and Blockburger was charged under the order form statute and the stamp package statute.","start":425.557,"stop":437.917,"duration":12.36},{"text":"The order forms statute doesn't have any presumption, so Blockburger did not have that issue as to whether or not you could get cumulative punishments from this substantially similar presumption.","start":437.917,"stop":452.626,"duration":14.71},{"text":"The Gore case, one count involved the order form, that's not -- that statute isn't involved in this case.","start":452.626,"stop":462.102,"duration":9.48},{"text":"The other two counts in Gore, Gore was charged with the purchase, sale and distribution of narcotic drugs from unstamped package in one of the other counts, and in the last count he was charged with transport -- transporting and concealing illegally imported drugs.","start":462.102,"stop":484.889,"duration":22.79},{"text":"The evidence in the Gore case show that Gore delivered narcotic drugs to a government agent in an unstamped package without any of the use of any order form.","start":484.889,"stop":501.918,"duration":17.03},{"text":"So, the Gore case really didn't involve the question whether or not there was a conviction on both presumptions.","start":501.918,"stop":512.568,"duration":10.65},{"text":"Now, these presumptions have been said to place on the defendant, the duty of going forward with the evidence and their vice consist in the fact that different offenses may be presumed in an essence from the same fact.","start":512.568,"stop":541.597,"duration":29.03},{"text":"In other words should you find -- if the jury finds that the defendant had possession of the drugs, then the burden of furnishing an explanation shifts to the defendant and if he doesn't furnish a satisfactory explanation, he can receive, according to the court below, cumulative sentences.","start":541.597,"stop":569.187,"duration":27.59},{"text":"Now, the Blockburger test which was referred to in the preceding argument, we don't believe, would require the imposition of cumulative sentences.","start":569.187,"stop":583.441,"duration":14.25},{"text":"And under that test, the test is whether each provision requires proofs -- proof of -- of an additional fact which the other does not.","start":583.441,"stop":595.647,"duration":12.21},{"text":"Well, here, Congress itself has said, by these presumption statutes that different proof isn't required.","start":595.647,"stop":606.451,"duration":10.8},{"text":"We don't have a situation where Congress hasn't spoken as to what the proof is, but here Congress in the very
