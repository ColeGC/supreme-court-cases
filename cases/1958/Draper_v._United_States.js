started in Chicago.","start":459.505,"stop":477.07,"duration":17.56},{"text":"And I think I have been somewhat swept away by some of the government's arguments because I noticed in rereading my reply

that a train comes from a place doesn't indicate the person on the train came from the point of origin of the train.","start":494.299,"stop":501.498,"duration":7.2},{"text":"But their argument is the mere fact that he was on a train from Chicago and answered the description justified the inference that while in Chicago he had violated the law.And I say that cannot be

basis of particular facts in the case.","start":525.715,"stop":531.693,"duration":5.98},{"text":"But I think it will be found that the better reason of all the cases go on the basis that the Second Circuit merely in the case last cited in the government -- by the government, at the end of its own brief, namely from where there is information obtained, the agents have a duty to do something and in that particular case after receiving information of pretty much the same kind this was received here, the agents didn't jump in and make an immediate arrest.","start":531.693,"stop":567.272,"duration":35.58},{"text":"They followed the man.","start":567.272,"stop":569.46,"duration":2.19},{"text":"They shadowed him to such a point that the man became aware of the fact that he was being shadowed.","start":569.46,"stop":576.538,"duration":7.08},{"text":"And on a particular occasion when the shadowing continued, made that awareness evident, in other words showed a consciousness of guilt as in for instance in the Husty case decided by this Court also cited by the government.","start":576.538,"stop":594.639,"duration":18.1},{"text":"The element of consciousness of guilt was involved because there, when the agents approached a car, the people in it started to run away.","start":594.639,"stop":606.545,"duration":11.91},{"text":"Now, in such situations where the arresting agents do something to justify an inference that a crime is being committed the arrest maybe a valid one.","start":606.545,"stop":621.032,"duration":14.49},{"text":"But I say that here, where the agents did nothing, you cannot draw any comfort from the circumstances that the individual answered the description, because obviously you never would have an arrest of a person unknown to agents unless somebody was able to give a description, and say at what place he was likely to be.","start":621.032,"stop":644.434,"duration":23.4},{"text":"And if from that mere mechanical fact which has no relation to the commission of crime, whatever, it is proper to draw an inference that a crime has been committed merely because somebody tells an agent that a crime is going to be committed, then I suggest our liberties are pretty far gone.","start":644.434,"stop":663.631,"duration":19.2},{"text":"And it seems to me that this case, without going into the basic question of hearsay, can rest on the proposition, that where information is obtained, it is the duty of the officer to whom the information is given in the first place to ascertain the basis on which the informant gives that information, has that information, and to testify either before a magistrate when seeking a warrant or before a court when the validity of the arrest is in question, to testify with regard to those circumstances.","start":663.631,"stop":706.289,"duration":42.66},{"text":"So, that the magistrate or the court can determine whether that testimony is sufficient, those details are sufficient, to justify an inference in a commission of crime.","start":706.289,"stop":715.463,"duration":9.17},{"text":"And in that respect it seems to me this case is very similar to the Giordenello case decided by this Court in the last term, where information was held insufficient, because conclusory only.","start":715.463,"stop":728.766,"duration":13.3},{"text":"So I say here the probable cause is insufficient, because based only on conclusions, and this case I submit is even stronger than the other one, because in at least in Giordenello, the statement of the complaint was positive that a crime had been committed.","start":728.766,"stop":747.481,"duration":18.72},{"text":"Whereas here this record can be searched in vain for any information given to the arresting officer, that a crime had been committed, all that is claimed is that the informer said he is going to Chicago to buy heroin, and that was several days before he returned.","start":747.481,"stop":766.663,"duration":19.18},{"text":"The agents might have made up to check, they made no efforts.","start":766.663,"stop":771.566,"duration":4.9},{"text":"We submit therefore that the evidence was -- the arrest was illegal, that the arrest is illegal, the evidence was improperly received.","start":771.566,"stop":779.937,"duration":8.37},{"text":"Obviously without that evidence, the procession of the heroin, the conviction could not stand.","start":779.937,"stop":788.093,"duration":8.16}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Then the Giordenello case
