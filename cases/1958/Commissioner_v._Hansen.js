“No.”","start":446.059,"stop":447.838,"duration":1.78},{"text":"This Court said he was required to report the amounts as income in 1920 because keeping accounts and making returns on the accrual

the right becomes fixed, then the right accrues.","start":447.838,"stop":477.651,"duration":29.81},{"text":"And the second controlling principle in these cases, related somewhat to the accrual

annual, as distinguished from a transactional, basis.","start":477.651,"stop":503.679,"duration":26.03},{"text":"In other words, the fact that an income producing transaction such as the sale of an

page 27.","start":583.842,"stop":587.785,"duration":3.94},{"text":"Now, during this taxable period, the Baird's, as I say, assigned their contracts and I want to point this out to that contrary to a

contract.","start":627.212,"stop":631.092,"duration":3.88},{"text":"Now, I will, for purposes of the gravity of time allotted me, refer solely to the details of the Minnehoma agreement for this reason.","start":631.092,"stop":642.891,"duration":11.8},{"text":"The Minnehoma agreement, of the three agreements involved in the Baird case, is the only one that is common to the three cases involving trailer dealers, that is Blaine Johnson in the Fourth Circuit, Texas Trailer-coach in the Fifth and the Baird case.","start":642.891,"stop":657.005,"duration":14.11},{"text":"Therefore, since it's as a common contract, and I'd like -- like to just simply stress that one contract.","start":657.005,"stop":667.029,"duration":10.02},{"text":"And, of course, as I have said that's at record 27 in toto and another reason for referring to that one is that it was entirely in writing.","start":667.029,"stop":676.577,"duration":9.55},{"text":"Now, under that contract, what were, what were the limitations on the Baird's that made their rights to these credited amounts so contingent that we contend they were not accruable in the years of the sales of the trailers?","start":676.577,"stop":692.725,"duration":16.15},{"text":"First, the trailer purchaser must complete a credit form supplied by Minnehoma.","start":692.725,"stop":698.281,"duration":5.56},{"text":"Minnehoma supplied the credit form.","start":698.281,"stop":700.586,"duration":2.31},{"text":"The dealer had to forward this in two copies of either at Dun & Bradstreet or a retail merchant's credit report to Minnehoma.","start":700.586,"stop":707.597,"duration":7.01},{"text":"And Minnehoma had to approve the purchaser's credit before there could be any sale.","start":707.597,"stop":713.435,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Secondly, each trailer contract had to be on a printed form provided by Minnehoma, in which the name, of course, Minnehoma is inserted therein at the appropriate places as will be shown in the record.","start":713.435,"stop":727.284,"duration":13.85},{"text":"Thirdly, the balance owed by the purchaser is payable only at the Minnehoma office in Tulsa and if, by any chance, it should be paid to the dealer, he has to immediately forward these under very stringent conditions on that.","start":727.284,"stop":741.113,"duration":13.83},{"text":"Next, Minnehoma designated the amount of the down payment.","start":741.113,"stop":746.518,"duration":5.4},{"text":"Fifthly, the dealer unconditionally guaranteed Minnehoma against any losses including loss of prospective profits.","start":746.518,"stop":757.153,"duration":10.63},{"text":"That's the wording of the agreement, “prospective profits”.","start":757.153,"stop":760.686,"duration":3.53},{"text":"This guarantee, therefore, covers much more than the 5% holdback.","start":760.686,"stop":766.133,"duration":5.45},{"text":"It covers insurance premiums for the full-term.","start":766.133,"stop":771.51,"duration":5.38},{"text":"If the -- if the purchaser would prepay, still Baird was liable only full-term insurance premium, same way with finance charges.","start":771.51,"stop":780.721,"duration":9.21},{"text":"They guaranteed full-term finance charges, prospective profits.","start":780.721,"stop":785.659,"duration":4.94},{"text":"So you can see that Baird's reserve was subject to being reduced by much more than the 5%, not only that involved but these other factors.","start":785.659,"stop":798.74,"duration":13.08},{"text":"And that, of course, is pointed out in detail at page 19 of the brief.","start":798.74,"stop":803.135,"duration":4.39},{"text":"Now, what does Baird get back?","start":803.135,"stop":806.147,"duration":3.01},{"text":"The contract says this, “An amount to be determined, to be determined by Minnehoma from time to time in its absolute discretion, equal to not more than 5%”.","start":806.147,"stop":819.859,"duration":13.71},{"text":"Not just 5%, equal to not more than 5%.","start":819.859,"stop":823.182,"duration":3.32},{"text":"But the total purchase price would be credited by Minnehoma.","start":823.182,"stop":828.133,"duration":4.95},{"text":"Payments, when do they be made?","start":828.133,"stop":833.021,"duration":4.89},{"text":"They are to be made only from time to time as determined by Minnehoma.","start":833.021,"stop":843.142,"duration":10.12},{"text":"Then in addition to this holdback reserve credit, Minnehoma may, but it doesn't have to, credit the partnership with a portion of the finance charge of matter solely within the discretion of Minnehoma.","start":843.142,"stop":859.614,"duration":16.47},{"text":"And then, of course, if that is done, that credit, of course, becomes subject to the same contingencies governing the hold -- the holdback, as I've already outlined.","start":859.614,"stop":869.335,"duration":9.72},{"text":"I call the Court's attention to a -- to another provision this contract, we think, makes Baird's rights extremely contingent.","start":869.335,"stop":876.72,"duration":7.38},{"text":"Minnehoma's determination as to the possibility of the contingent liability shall be filed and not subject to question by the dealer.","start":876.72,"stop":888.056,"duration":11.34},{"text":"And how could that be written any stronger, I submit?","start":888.056,"stop":893.384,"duration":5.33},{"text":"Thirdly or I should say further, Minnehoma could reassign any contract upon such terms as -- and conditions as Minnehoma should determine and even if they did that without Baird having anything to say about it, they didn't waive their rights against Baird, expressly in the contract and then such as her niece would succeed to all of Minnehoma's rights against Baird.","start":893.384,"stop":922.018,"duration":28.63},{"text":"Now, as I say, these identical facts were before the Fourth Circuit in the Johnson case and they were before the Fifth Circuit in the Texas Trailer-coach case.","start":922.018,"stop":935.54,"duration":13.52},{"text":"In Johnson, there were other contracts also which, as we say, just as we had other contracts, we think that fundamentally, they were of the same general nature but, of course, differed in their precise wording.","start":935.54,"stop":953.073,"duration":17.53},{"text":"In the Seventh Circuit opinion in this case, we feel that the Court made an error in failing to perceive the identical factual situation between the two cases because there is a reference in the opinion of that Court to a possible deviation between the facts where the Court states in the last paragraph of its opinion, “Ignoring some of the factual differences,” the Court said, “we decline to follow if -- all the same rather, “we decline to follow Johnson and Texas Trailer-coach”.","start":953.073,"stop":990.586,"duration":37.51},{"text":"I submit there are no factual differences and that that error caused the opinion of the Seventh Circuit to be contrary to these petitioners.","start":990.586,"stop":1001.983,"duration":11.4},{"text":"The reason, as I say, that I say the facts are the same, it was stipulated in the tax court trial of the Baird case that the entire Blaine Johnson record was received in evidence in the Baird case.","start":1001.983,"stop":1018.604,"duration":16.62},{"text":"How could the facts be different on that stipulation?","start":1018.604,"stop":1023.132,"duration":4.53},{"text":"Secondly, in the -- in the Texas Trailer-coach case, the only finance company involved was Minnehoma.","start":1023.132,"stop":1030.585,"duration":7.45},{"text":"The contract was in evidence, the agreements were in evidence and, of course, they were identical with the agreements in the Baird case because Minnehoma had drawn up a set of agreements and contracts which it used uniformly with trailer dealers.","start":1030.585,"stop":1047.002,"duration":16.42},{"text":"And in any event, they are identical and our comparison shows that.","start":1047.002,"stop":1050.903,"duration":3.9},{"text":"Now, the basic accrual principles coming to those points, as I say I will not dwell at length because I think they have been covered.","start":1050.903,"stop":1061.383,"duration":10.48},{"text":"But I would like to point out to the Court that it has been held on several occasions that a strained construction in administrative efforts to accrue income should be avoided.","start":1061.383,"stop":1079.904,"duration":18.52},{"text":"And we submit that the position here of the respondent is an extremely strained effort to accrue income regardless of what else may be said.","start":1079.904,"stop":1093.951,"duration":14.05},{"text":"I also like to point out that in the Dixie Pine Products case and the Security Flour Mills case of this Court in 1944, Mr. Justice Black said that the right to income -- excuse me, when the right to income has become final and definite in amount, then the income is to be accrued.","start":1093.951,"stop":1124.082,"duration":30.13},{"text":"And I think that in some of the discussions on this point, those cases have been overlooked.","start":1124.082,"stop":1131.519,"duration":7.44},{"text":"And I call the Court's attention to those cases which, of course, cited in the brief.","start":1131.519,"stop":1136.335,"duration":4.82},{"text":"We feel that we have shown that substantial contingencies govern the petitioner's rights to the amounts credited.","start":1136.335,"stop":1143.883,"duration":7.55},{"text":"They were, of course, clearly unavailable to the petitioner's in any sense during the tax years involved whether they would ever be available was uncertain during the taxable years because of this wide control of the finance companies over the credited amounts.","start":1143.883,"stop":1163.061,"duration":19.18},{"text":"And as I have already pointed out, the respondent has never challenged the similarity in effect of the three finance companies that we have involved in this case.","start":1163.061,"stop":1176.863,"duration":13.8},{"text":"So, of course, as time won't permit, I won't go into the others except to say that they are substantially similar.","start":1176.863,"stop":1181.721,"duration":4.86},{"text":"Now, with respect to this one or two transactions hypothesis, of course, we say under the decided cases of that there simply was one transaction here.","start":1181.721,"stop":1195.858,"duration":14.14},{"text":"The -- that was so held expressly in those words in Johnson and expressly in Texas Trailer-coach, and our facts are identical.","start":1195.858,"stop":1203.95,"duration":8.09},{"text":"And we say that only that result can obtain here.","start":1203.95,"stop":1207.892,"duration":3.94},{"text":"We say that further in its brief, the respondent states on pages 40 and 41 that regardless of whether this Court holds a one or two transaction hypothesis, the tax result must be the same.","start":1207.892,"stop":1230.089,"duration":22.2},{"text":"So curiously enough, we find respondent arguing in this Court that there are two transactions and it's saying the brief that it makes no difference.","start":1230.089,"stop":1241.263,"duration":11.17},{"text":"Now, quickly as to the finance company being a party, we think in treat and in fact it was a
