time, boxing on a national scale had been largely dominated for some years by a tax record and later, from 1937 to 1948 or 1949 by Mike Jacobs who had a lease on the Madison Square Garden.","start":136.901,"stop":157.39,"duration":20.49},{"text":"In 1948 or 1949, Jacobs held had failed and the he was completely enacted.","start":157.39,"stop":164.683,"duration":7.29},{"text":"A smaller boxing organization, the Tournament of Champions had started early in 1948, had declined almost to the vanishing point, was seeking to get out of business and salvage something.","start":164.683,"stop":181.703,"duration":17.02},{"text":"Joe Louis, who had held the center of the stage for a long time was quitting his heavyweight crown and trying to arrange a series

only 6% of the Garden business and involved just a smaller amount of its personnel, yet it did provide income normally necessary for the Garden to operate with profit.","start":211.853,"stop":229.406,"duration":17.55},{"text":"The garden had a large investment.","start":229.406,"stop":232.168,"duration":2.76},{"text":"Its expenses were in one sense, enormous and it was necessary for it to schedule and present popular events covering a great majority of the time it had opened.","start":232.168,"stop":248.422,"duration":16.25},{"text":"They want it and badly needed the boxing events to continue.","start":248.422,"stop":255.176,"duration":6.75},{"text":"Now, in 1949 and since 1937, Mrs.Wirtz and Norris held a substantial block of Madison Square

was an afterthought designed to -- at that particular period of the boxing history to get the Stadium into the -- on the block side a ledger and to help the Garden from losing to the margin that it had.","start":333.434,"stop":353.153,"duration":19.72},{"text":"A settlement was made, an agreement was made with Joe Louis.","start":353.153,"stop":358.838,"duration":5.69},{"text":"The I.B.C. is to organize as promoting organizations.","start":358.838,"stop":364.784,"duration":5.95},{"text":"The surrender of Mike Jacobs' lease was purchased and the Tournament of Champions was acquired.","start":364.784,"stop":374.92,"duration":10.14},{"text":"The two I.B.C.'s promoted professional fights, championship and nonchampionship.","start":374.92,"stop":381.156,"duration":6.24},{"text":"There was a Friday night series and then a Wednesday night series which I think it's -- everybody has pretty common knowledge.","start":381.156,"stop":388.928,"duration":7.77},{"text":"As a result of this, there was a revival in the professional boxing in the Garden and in the United States as a whole and with other promoters.","start":388.928,"stop":402.784,"duration":13.86},{"text":"But the Stadium continued to lose money.","start":402.784,"stop":406.188,"duration":3.4},{"text":"Now, these aren't to show under the facts which led to the agreements that are under attack in this case.","start":406.188,"stop":414.636,"duration":8.45},{"text":"I want to mention that those agreements were made with layman, lawyers, and judges, were almost unanimously to the opinion that sports arrangements of this kind did not violate the law under the (Inaudible) case.","start":414.636,"stop":437.617,"duration":22.98},{"text":"The contracts made with other arenas by the defendants were historically typical and nothing unusual.","start":437.617,"stop":446.392,"duration":8.77},{"text":"The same was true as the well-established return bout agreements and three year exclusive contracts with boxers.","start":446.392,"stop":457.08,"duration":10.69},{"text":"Our position on this matter is more fully covered in the brief.","start":457.08,"stop":462.3,"duration":5.22},{"text":"We say here briefly that the agreements were made by the defendants because necessary to say for declining industry which industry in turn was necessary to the continued operation of there to expansive buildings.","start":462.3,"stop":483.884,"duration":21.58},{"text":"No conducts of the defendants caused the death for the Tournament of Champions.","start":483.884,"stop":489.732,"duration":5.85},{"text":"They were seeking and unable to find anyone to salvage their operation.","start":489.732,"stop":495.66,"duration":5.93},{"text":"The same is true of the St.Louis arrangement and the Jacob's contract.","start":495.66,"stop":500.785,"duration":5.13},{"text":"Those people, Louis and Jacobs with the movements because they were at the end of their road.","start":500.785,"stop":510.572,"duration":9.79},{"text":"There was no previous boxing competition between the Madison Square Garden on the one hand, Stadium on the other or between any of the various defendants.","start":510.572,"stop":525.901,"duration":15.33},{"text":"And hence there was no competition to lesson in this case because none existed.","start":525.901,"stop":532.127,"duration":6.23},{"text":"The exclusive contacts with the boxers were for a reasonable period and they were necessary for the continuity required for the continuous operation of a Stadium or an arena.","start":532.127,"stop":550.179,"duration":18.05},{"text":"These agreements in turn protected the boxers themselves.","start":550.179,"stop":555.556,"duration":5.38},{"text":"There is nothing in the record, not one single word to show that the defendants excluded from boxing any boxer, that they excluded a single promoter, or that any -- or excluded any other Stadium, or any television arrangement, or any radio or moving picture company.","start":555.556,"stop":583.29,"duration":27.73},{"text":"The defendants did not own TV or other TV time.","start":583.29,"stop":589.051,"duration":5.76},{"text":"At the date of the decree, they were negotiating, that is they did not own over a period of time.","start":589.051,"stop":595.864,"duration":6.81},{"text":"They were negotiating for a contract which covered a reasonable continuity on this.","start":595.864,"stop":602.778,"duration":6.91},{"text":"There was no monopoly of championship boxing unless it can arise solely from percentages.","start":602.778,"stop":612.405,"duration":9.63},{"text":"They did have a large percent of it.","start":612.405,"stop":616.776,"duration":4.37},{"text":"Before the decree, the Garden and the Stadium were losing their position, have lost all their heavyweight bouts.","start":616.776,"stop":627.484,"duration":10.71},{"text":"Nor was there any monopoly on television.","start":627.484,"stop":631.234,"duration":3.75},{"text":"Indecently, the sponsors and the advertisers of television are much more powerful than either these corporations of any of these defendants could be.","start":631.234,"stop":645.023,"duration":13.79},{"text":"As to the Stadium, the defendants at the time with the decree control only one of the several suitable stadium in New York and only two out of hundreds suitable stadiums in the United States.","start":645.023,"stop":662.39,"duration":17.37},{"text":"And those two that they control so to speak belonged to them.","start":662.39,"stop":668.216,"duration":5.83},{"text":"Under these conditions, there is not and could not be any possible control of price.","start":668.216,"stop":679.31,"duration":11.09},{"text":"Now, that price element was lamely brought into this case in the brief in this Court and never found below.","start":679.31,"stop":690.501,"duration":11.19},{"text":"The prices as a matter of fact, boxing must be reported to the respective boxing commissioners for their consideration.","start":690.501,"stop":702.803,"duration":12.3},{"text":"Defendants have not restricted or restrained the boxing industry.","start":702.803,"stop":707.59,"duration":4.79},{"text":"On the contrary, the result of their action, they have expanded the number of good boxing contests with other promoters, have decreased the admission prices, have provided television for millions of viewers, and it helped the boxers financially, and helped the viewing public.","start":707.59,"stop":730.82,"duration":23.23},{"text":"There is no semblance of monopoly in -- of professional boxing as a whole.","start":730.82,"stop":740.031,"duration":9.21},{"text":"There are 2000 professional boxing programs in the United States each year involving almost 20,000 boxers because they have several bouts.","start":740.031,"stop":755.451,"duration":15.42},{"text":"The championship -- the non -- the -- all the -- all the boxing contests promoted by all the defendants at the maximum between 80 and 90 a year.","start":755.451,"stop":773.406,"duration":17.95},{"text":"In the championship field, it is six to eight a year.","start":773.406,"stop":781.959,"duration":8.55},{"text":"Now, there in our opinion, there is no violation even if the profitable market is a championship boxing market.","start":781.959,"stop":793.312,"duration":11.35},{"text":"But they have sought the -- the Government has sought to post its case to make it stronger by picking out what we say as an artificial market that is confining it to championship boxing and not to all boxing.","start":793.312,"stop":816.538,"duration":23.23},{"text":"We say that is wrong.","start":816.538,"stop":820.221,"duration":3.68},{"text":"The District Court itself conceded that a violation was dependent on that market and that there would be no violation in any event if the market included professional boxing.","start":820.221,"stop":841.101,"duration":20.88},{"text":"The only distinction between the two, we urge upon you, is a difference of quantity and not of kind.","start":841.101,"stop":851.477,"duration":10.38},{"text":"Within any market, there are differences in cost, differences in price, and quality, and acceptance, and demand.","start":851.477,"stop":865.368,"duration":13.89},{"text":"If these factors did not exist then there would be no competition possible in that market.","start":865.368,"stop":875.721,"duration":10.35},{"text":"It takes those differences to make competition conversely.","start":875.721,"stop":880.392,"duration":4.67},{"text":"If the existence of these differences define a market then conceivably each product in the market could be -- each product in the business could be a market because if every factor were identical on the theory -- on the theory proposed then there would be a monopoly in one product.","start":880.392,"stop":907.72,"duration":27.33},{"text":"We say that the Court, the District Court cannot select and define its market just to create a situation where they can argue that there's a violation of law.","start":907.72,"stop":923.631,"duration":15.91},{"text":"This would rather be a bootstrap operation.","start":923.631,"stop":927.593,"duration":3.96},{"text":"And the cases they have said starting with Columbia Steel that it's first necessary to delimit the market.","start":927.593,"stop":935.671,"duration":8.08},{"text":"It is true and the facts we think are immaterial.","start":935.671,"stop":940.835,"duration":5.16},{"text":"It is true that on the average, championship bouts have a higher prestige in publicity, a greater public demand on the average, a larger number of viewers, they bring in more dollars on gate receipts or television.","start":940.835,"stop":963.01,"duration":22.17},{"text":"But that's just the average.","start":963.01,"stop":965.733,"duration":2.72},{"text":"Both championship and nonchampionship fights, either classification, they're maybe poor, they're maybe -- fail, or they're maybe good and there are differences in amount depending on that.","start":965.733,"stop":980.441,"duration":14.71},{"text":"And there are some better championship fights that are larger in every way than some nonchampionship fights which often occurs based on the popularity of the participants in which outlays the rating, technical rating of championship.","start":980.441,"stop":1003.956,"duration":23.51},{"text":"Now that's -- that situation is applicable to similar products of the same business of others in the same field.","start":1003.956,"stop":1015.031,"duration":11.07},{"text":"There is nothing for a -- in our case, there's nothing to show even one that there is a substantial audience for championship fights as distinguished from audience for nonchampionship fights.","start":1015.031,"stop":1032.996,"duration":17.97},{"text":"There maybe more a number.","start":1032.996,"stop":1035.741,"duration":2.74},{"text":"But the natural presumption is and there is evidence in the record which states it, that is undenied.","start":1035.741,"stop":1045.588,"duration":9.85},{"text":"That all who view championship fights, all or maybe at one time or another viewers of nonchampionship fights, some nonchampionship fights.","start":1045.588,"stop":1056.875,"duration":11.29},{"text":"In other words, the audience may be more accumulated when it's a championship fight but it's the same people.","start":1056.875,"stop":1066.253,"duration":9.38},{"text":"Individual boxers start as novices.","start":1066.253,"stop":1070.634,"duration":4.38},{"text":"They go up the scale.","start":1070.634,"stop":1072.391,"duration":1.76},{"text":"Some of them become champions.","start":1072.391,"stop":1074.605,"duration":2.21},{"text":"Some of the champions move downward and some of those that move downward move up again.","start":1074.605,"stop":1082.128,"duration":7.52},{"text":"And this testimony was given by witness which was not challenged or denied at all or contradicted.","start":1082.128,"stop":1091.377,"duration":9.25},{"text":"He said, \"This is a sport where boys are fighting for the championships.\"","start":1091.377,"stop":1096.881,"duration":5.5},{"text":"That starts with the novice.","start":1096.881,"stop":1099.703,"duration":2.82},{"text":"\"We are showing them each week that we can show champions, why we want to do so.\"","start":1099.703,"stop":1108.265,"duration":8.56},{"text":"And that shows that the boxing -- professional boxing is all one market.","start":1108.265,"stop":1118.605,"duration":10.34},{"text":"Both of them timed with a weekly series, it is Wednesday and Friday night and some other promoters have other night series.","start":1118.605,"stop":1128.772,"duration":10.17},{"text":"When there was a championship fight in the series, it's the main attraction.","start":1128.772,"stop":1133.55,"duration":4.78},{"text":"But when there is not a championship fight in the series then some nonchampionship fight is the main attraction.","start":1133.55,"stop":1143.13,"duration":9.58},{"text":"In either case, the prestige of the championship fight or the nonchampionship fight contributes to the success of the weekly series and makes its continuation possible.","start":1143.13,"stop":1162.816,"duration":19.69},{"text":"The sponsored -- the sponsors who really should know (Inaudible) of about this matter, testified unanimously that all professional boxing as far as they was concerned was one market.","start":1162.816,"stop":1182.773,"duration":19.96},{"text":"We believe that the championship and nonchampionship fights are to a large degree inter changing.","start":1182.773,"stop":1191.467,"duration":8.69},{"text":"And under the Cellophane case, the market could not be split artificially into -- Cellophane as you gentlemen will remember cost two or three times more than the other products.","start":1191.467,"stop":1206.913,"duration":15.45},{"text":"And the average -- dollar averages go higher.","start":1206.913,"stop":1210.456,"duration":3.54},{"text":"But those facts did not justify a dollar division of the market.","start":1210.456,"stop":1218.969,"duration":8.51},{"text":"The Times-Picayune case was a different -- even different readers read the morning and the evening papers, yet this Court found that they could not split that market in the morning and afternoon that it was a relevant market.","start":1218.969,"stop":1243.457,"duration":24.49},{"text":"I suppose the General Motors du Pont case which confined the matter to paint products sold the motor companies was one of the most restrictive of the market decisions.","start":1243.457,"stop":1260.375,"duration":16.92},{"text":"But there, there was no narrowing on the market on the basis of quantity of dollars or relative figures.","start":1260.375,"stop":1269.384,"duration":9.01},{"text":"As a matter of fact, the basis in -- by inference ignored that distinction and made it only on the different customers which does not arise in this case and from that case.","start":1269.384,"stop":1284.678,"duration":15.29},{"text":"This case is clearly a distinction.","start":1284.678,"stop":1288.241,"duration":3.56},{"text":"And it is rather amusing in a way that the plaintiff itself in writing his brief in this case could not refrain from disclosing the fact that in -- at least involuntarily.","start":1288.241,"stop":1306.101,"duration":17.86},{"text":"They thought it was a single market.","start":1306.101,"stop":1308.873,"duration":2.77},{"text":"In page five of their brief, the language is, \"Professional boxing including championship boxing.\"","start":1308.873,"stop":1317.266,"duration":8.39},{"text":"And on 35, they said the championship fights are included within the classification of good fights which of course includes the great men in nonchampionship.","start":1317.266,"stop":1330.259,"duration":12.99},{"text":"Now, we respectfully submit that the professional boxing market is a criterion and was used.","start":1330.259,"stop":1343.936,"duration":13.68},{"text":"If so, admittedly by the Court and by the counsel for the plaintiff in their briefs, this case would have to be dismissed because

industry.","start":1343.936,"stop":1375.459,"duration":31.52},{"text":"Now, the -- if it should happen and we of course being passed and do not see, it could
