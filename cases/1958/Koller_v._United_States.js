War.","start":41.672,"stop":48.138,"duration":6.47},{"text":"The statutory objective included fair distribution of goods, avoidance of dislocation of the economy, discouragement of speculation, and

only to that of the federal government.","start":65.391,"stop":71.114,"duration":5.72},{"text":"And in addition to that, the veterans were given the exclusive right to acquire certain specific types and quantities of property which was set aside for them.","start":71.114,"stop":81.032,"duration":9.92},{"text":"These -- a lot of types and quantities and property could be acquired by veterans who

Koller and Silverbrook were veterans who applied for and obtained these priority certificates.","start":91.823,"stop":98.019,"duration":6.2},{"text":"They -- instead of using them for the purposes to which were intended and which were certified in their application, they sold them to a third party.","start":98.019,"stop":106.173,"duration":8.15},{"text":"Koller executed two fraudulent applications and this -- his certificates were used by the third party to purchase two trucks and one car.","start":106.173,"stop":115.377,"duration":9.2},{"text":"Silverbrook's certificate was used to purchase six busses and three trucks.","start":115.377,"stop":120.854,"duration":5.48},{"text":"Both petitioners were indicted to these fraudulent acts.","start":120.854,"stop":123.569,"duration":2.72},{"text":"They pleaded guilty, and they each paid small fines.","start":123.569,"stop":128.491,"duration":4.92},{"text":"In the present case as Mr. Malis stated the third day, the Government has to enforce civil remedies provided by this Act, the Surplus Property Act of 1944.","start":128.491,"stop":137.786,"duration":9.29},{"text":"Section 26 (b) sets forth three alternative measures of recovery and the first one was the one used here, $2000 for each fraudulent act and double

$2000.","start":148.287,"stop":153.858,"duration":5.57},{"text":"The petitioners' only defense was that the suit was barred by statute of limitations because it is not been brought within five years of the acts complained of.","start":153.858,"stop":163.398,"duration":9.54},{"text":"There's no statute of limitations in the Surplus Property Act itself, the -- one rely to parties, one contained in Title 28, Section 2462 imposing a five-year limitation upon suits for a civil fine, penalty or forfeiture.","start":163.398,"stop":180.229,"duration":16.83},{"text":"The courts below -- both courts below relied upon the decision of this Court only three years ago, Rex Trailer Company versus United States and held that the recovery sought by the Government and obtained by the Government was not such as civil fine, penalty or forfeiture.","start":180.229,"stop":196.104,"duration":15.88},{"text":"Now, the petitioners do not dispute that damage to the Government could be anticipated from violations of this Act.","start":196.104,"stop":202.614,"duration":6.51},{"text":"There's none for that matter that damage was actually sustained here.","start":202.614,"stop":205.827,"duration":3.21},{"text":"And I think the problem can be put in a perspective by examining the elements of damage which the Court set forth in Rex Trailer Company versus United States.","start":205.827,"stop":216.07,"duration":10.24},{"text":"First, the policy of the Congress concerning disposal of this property were frustrated.","start":216.07,"stop":223.293,"duration":7.22},{"text":"The fraud diverted the vehicles, these 12 vehicles from veterans or other priority claimants who were entitled to them.","start":223.293,"stop":232.035,"duration":8.74},{"text":"Second, Mr. Justice Clark in Rex Trailer Company pointed out that there was a pecuniary loss suffered by the United States.","start":232.035,"stop":241.019,"duration":8.98},{"text":"The sale on these priority certificates was at a much lower price than petitioners or anyone else could have paid -- could have paid for these vehicles on the open market.","start":241.019,"stop":251.123,"duration":10.1},{"text":"So, the Government sold these vehicles for a price lower than their market value.","start":251.123,"stop":256.149,"duration":5.03},{"text":"In addition, since the fraud decreased the number of vehicles available to government agencies, it may very well be -- it could be reasonably anticipated that a -- federal agencies would have to go out and buy the same vehicles because they have been obtained fraudulently by impeachment.","start":256.149,"stop":274.958,"duration":18.81},{"text":"Third is the element of the unjust enrichment to the perpetuators of the fraud themselves.","start":274.958,"stop":280.236,"duration":5.28},{"text":"Mr. -- Mr. Justice Clark indicated these elements in the Rex Trailer case but the record there was not adequate to show its existence.","start":280.236,"stop":288.004,"duration":7.77},{"text":"Here on the other hand, we have the admitted fact that the petitioners sold their certificates to this third party for a consideration, a consideration which undoubtedly reflected the difference between the market value of these vehicles and the price which the Government was wiling to take from veterans and veterans alone.","start":288.004,"stop":305.249,"duration":17.25},{"text":"Fourth element, not mentioned by the Court in Rex Trailer but pointed out by the Third Circuit in this case.","start":305.249,"stop":311.184,"duration":5.94},{"text":"It's the element of the cause of investigation and litigation which Congress might have had in mind in setting up this measure of recovery in the Act.","start":311.184,"stop":320.461,"duration":9.28},{"text":"Now, once these items of damage -- anticipated damage are set forth then it becomes clear that what we have here in 26 (b) (1) of the Surplus Property Act is a common legislative device.","start":320.461,"stop":333.534,"duration":13.07},{"text":"To use the language in the Rex Trailer case is the fixing of a lump sum in damages in a situation where the actual damage maybe difficult or impossible to ascertain.","start":333.534,"stop":343.654,"duration":10.12},{"text":"Now, the Court also said, it is the function of liquidated damages to provide a measure of recovery and just of circumstances.","start":343.654,"stop":350.177,"duration":6.52},{"text":"The judgment for $2000 for each fraudulent act which was the one upheld in that case was held comparable to recovery under liquidated damage provisions.","start":350.177,"stop":359.375,"duration":9.2},{"text":"In the same way in Marcus versus Hess of 317 U.S., the almost identical civil remedy of the False Claims Act was involved.","start":359.375,"stop":367.975,"duration":8.6},{"text":"And the Court held there that the purpose and effect of this kind of recovery was to provide indemnity or restitution to the Government for -- for the fraud against it.","start":367.975,"stop":377.941,"duration":9.97},{"text":"The device of double damages plus specific sum was chosen, the Court said, to assure that the Government would be made completely whole.","start":377.941,"stop":385.852,"duration":7.91},{"text":"And the choice of such a sum, the discretion in fixing this kind of recovery to assure that the Government would be is whole the choice was up to Congress.","start":385.852,"stop":399.07,"duration":13.22}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Could you give an you give an example of what you see would be a civil penalty under the

penalty.","start":436.05,"stop":445.66,"duration":9.61},{"text":"A few others, a ship owner who requires a seaman to work more than eight hours a day, pay a sentence of -- is subject for the payment of a certain sum.","start":445.66,"stop":454.675,"duration":9.01},{"text":"This kind of penalty goes way back.","start":454.675,"stop":456.427,"duration":1.75},{"text":"One of the earliest ones we have is a participation in a slave trade which could result in a forfeiture of vessel and the payment of certain sum.","start":456.427,"stop":464.312,"duration":7.88},{"text":"I think the key to all these cases and each one of these situations, there was no transaction of the Government.","start":464.312,"stop":469.943,"duration":5.63},{"text":"There was no possible foreseeable liability to the Government under any contract towards principles.","start":469.943,"stop":475.966,"duration":6.02},{"text":"And so what we have in those situations, the Government is seeking to vindicate either a general public policy or the interest of a specific protected class like seaman or another situation, Indians.","start":475.966,"stop":490.731,"duration":14.76},{"text":"The statutes state that a person who surveyed Indian land illegally is subject to a penalty of $1000 which the Government can collect.","start":490.731,"stop":500.129,"duration":9.4},{"text":"Now, this line has been indeed drawn under 2462.","start":500.129,"stop":504.623,"duration":4.49},{"text":"The cases under 2462 recognize that a legislature -- the Congress or legislature of the states can establish measures of
