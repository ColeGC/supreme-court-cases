deny certain expenses that a factual determination should be made under Section 24 logically prior to a determination under Section 23 for if a factual determination is made, that expense is personal.","start":285.47,"stop":308.875,"duration":23.4},{"text":"Section 24 strikes it down immediately.","start":308.875,"stop":311.836,"duration":2.96},{"text":"There is no necessity to refer to Section 23 in any way because Section 24 says, “No deduction shall be allowed for a personal expenditure.”","start":311.836,"stop":323.758,"duration":11.92},{"text":"Now, in the proceedings below, in the Tax Court, the criteria by which this matter was resolved and which has been used in other cases stated in brief on rare occasions, but has never been fully implemented was that an inquiry should be made to determine whether or not under the all of the factual circumstances is reasonable to expect demand to move his home to his place of employment.","start":323.758,"stop":353.135,"duration":29.38},{"text":"Now, if under that criteria, which was -- which was developed in the Tax Court's decisions and which was reviewed by the entire court, Your Honor, they determined that it was unreasonable to expect our petitioners to move their homes to construction sites under these factual circumstances.","start":353.135,"stop":376.19,"duration":23.06},{"text":"With that factual determination before the Court, then the question of the personal nature of these expenses were disposed of and the same thing is true of all of these travel expenses, the commuting situation which has complicated this issue ever since the Barnhill case.","start":376.19,"stop":396.653,"duration":20.46},{"text":"Unfortunately, the Barnhill case realized that commuting in a sense, forces travel to get to work.","start":396.653,"stop":405.929,"duration":9.28},{"text":"And they said, “We cannot reach the conclusion that a man's home is where he lives because of the commuting analogy.”","start":405.929,"stop":415.076,"duration":9.15},{"text":"But there are two rebuttals to that, Your Honor.","start":415.076,"stop":417.319,"duration":2.24},{"text":"The first is that commuting expense and travel expense must be separate and distinct types of expenses because the statute specifically permits the deduction of travel expense, but it does not permit the deduction of commuting expense.","start":417.319,"stop":433.607,"duration":16.29},{"text":"The only thing necessary to clarify that particular phase of the problem is for the Court to make a preliminary determination if this is, is or not commuting expense and no one is arguing that commuting expenses should be deductible.","start":433.607,"stop":448.24,"duration":14.63},{"text":"They have never been treated as an ordinary and necessary business expense.","start":448.24,"stop":452.92,"duration":4.68},{"text":"They have been labeled personal and it's to pointed out in brief, I think, that this was an unfortunate and a fact to which contributes to the confusion here because by classifying commuting expense of this person and then analogizing commuting to travel expense, you get this word “personal” brought back in to the picture improperly.","start":452.92,"stop":476.45,"duration":23.53},{"text":"It then obscures the element of choice, which, I think, is the fundamental issue in all of these cases whether or not these expenses result from the personal choice of a taxpayer or required by the needs of his business.","start":476.45,"stop":492.758,"duration":16.31},{"text":"Our people have homes.","start":492.758,"stop":496.821,"duration":4.06},{"text":"They're -- they tried to -- to stabilize their families, they have their children in school, all of these factors, and there are away from home in every sense of the word.","start":496.821,"stop":510.135,"duration":13.31},{"text":"And on that point, one further thing, Section 24 requires an ascertainment of the difference between a personal expense and a business expense.","start":510.135,"stop":526.403,"duration":16.27},{"text":"It does not require an ascertainment of the difference between a -- a deductible travel expense and a nondeductible one.","start":526.403,"stop":535.054,"duration":8.65},{"text":"This is a matter which order in the Section -- the purview of Section 23.","start":535.054,"stop":540.325,"duration":5.27},{"text":"Section 23 says expenses that are ordinary and necessary are deductible.","start":540.325,"stop":545.645,"duration":5.32},{"text":"It does not permit all business expenses as deduction.","start":545.645,"stop":549.812,"duration":4.17},{"text":"So the theory of 24 is to distinguish between business and personal expenses.","start":549.812,"stop":557.912,"duration":8.1},{"text":"The function of 23 is to decide whether or not a particular travel expense is or is not deductible by meeting the three requirements which this Court has established.","start":557.912,"stop":571.285,"duration":13.37},{"text":"Now, under this rationale of stating that an expense is personal because it is already been decided to be nondeductible, Section 24 is then emasculated and becomes nonfunctional because the result has already been previously determined under 23 so by this one theory, one principle of saying home is where you work, 23 is in the sense rendered nonfunctional and 24, both, are rendered non-functional.","start":571.285,"stop":608.762,"duration":37.48},{"text":"At that point, then the so-called exception comes into the picture and the entire legal controversy revolves around what is temporary and what is indefinite and it is our position, Your Honor, that at this stage of the game, they -- that theory is completely out from -- on the both statutes.","start":608.762,"stop":630.045,"duration":21.28},{"text":"It's running free.","start":630.045,"stop":631.322,"duration":1.28},{"text":"It's fabricating
