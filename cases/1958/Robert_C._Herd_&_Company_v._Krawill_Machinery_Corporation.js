Herd & Company, a contracting stevedore doing business in Baltimore, Maryland.","start":26.255,"stop":33.577,"duration":7.32},{"text":"The respondents were shippers of certain cases or packages of the machinery parts from Baltimore to Valencia, Spain.","start":33.577,"stop":43.095,"duration":9.52},{"text":"The facts are substantially as follows.Pursuant to contracts of carriage, the evidence by bills of lading which were prepared by representatives of the Krawill Machinery Corporation and Associates which were accepted by the master and the general agents of the Steamship Castillo Ampudia, whereby, the owners of the Castillo Ampudia agree to carry certain packages or cases of machinery parts from Baltimore to Valencia on its steamship, Castillo Ampudia.","start":43.095,"stop":76.803,"duration":33.71},{"text":"The general agents of the steamship company employed the petitioner to load the shipment.","start":76.803,"stop":83.395,"duration":6.59},{"text":"It was determined that the equipment of the -- loading equipment of the vessel was too late to lift these cases.","start":83.395,"stop":90.414,"duration":7.02},{"text":"So, the petitioner employed a floating derrick from the Bethlehem Steel Company for that purpose.","start":90.414,"stop":97.987,"duration":7.57},{"text":"And on April the 14th, 1954, while loading was in progress, one of these cases slipped from the slings as it was being hoisted and fell into the water which caused considerable damage to its contents.","start":97.987,"stop":114.188,"duration":16.2},{"text":"Now the shippers, instead of filing a libel against the vessel or proceeding against the owner in admiralty as was usual in such cases, filed an action at law, at common law in the District Court for the District of Maryland against the Bethlehem Steel Company as owner of the derrick, and petitioner as the contracting stevedore.","start":114.188,"stop":136.701,"duration":22.51},{"text":"And at the trial without a jury, Judge Thompson of the District Court held Bethlehem Steel Company free of fault.","start":136.701,"stop":144.438,"duration":7.74},{"text":"The petitioner is solely at fault.","start":144.438,"stop":147.104,"duration":2.67},{"text":"And it refused to allow the petitioner to benefit from the limitation-of-liability provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act or by the provisions of the contracts of carriage as evidenced by the bills of lading.","start":147.104,"stop":165.269,"duration":18.16},{"text":"The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.","start":165.269,"stop":168.817,"duration":3.55},{"text":"The Fourth Circuit affirmed.","start":168.817,"stop":170.29,"duration":1.47},{"text":"Then, both courts, the District and the Court of Appeals held, that because neither the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act nor the contracts of carriage as evidenced by the bills of lading mentioned stevedores, that stevedores were strangers to the contract of carry -- contracts of carriage and that therefore, they could obtain no rights either under the terms of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act or under the terms of the contracts of carriages evidenced by the bills of lading.","start":170.29,"stop":206.091,"duration":35.8},{"text":"Now, let us look for a minute at the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.","start":206.091,"stop":211.244,"duration":5.15},{"text":"The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act was passed by Congress in 1936 to regulate the Carriage of Goods by Sea from and to American ports in foreign trade.","start":211.244,"stop":227.313,"duration":16.07},{"text":"It provided among other things that a carrier should include an owner and the charter of the steamship or of a vessel.","start":227.313,"stop":237.337,"duration":10.02},{"text":"It provided further that the term carriage of contract applies only to contracts of carriage covered by a bill of lading or any similar document of title and so forth as such document relates to the Carriage of Goods by Sea.","start":237.337,"stop":253.355,"duration":16.02},{"text":"It then provided that the term “carriage of goods” covers the time from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the vessel.","start":253.355,"stop":263.993,"duration":10.64},{"text":"And then it put the burden upon the shipowner to load, stall, care for, and discharge the goods' care.","start":263.993,"stop":270.72,"duration":6.73}]},{"speakerName":"Charles E.

goods are loaded on until the time when they are discharged from the ship.","start":276.9,"stop":286.864,"duration":9.96},{"text":"Now, as to that provision however, the American courts at least have very generally held that the Carriage of Goods Act comes into play when the tackle of the ship or it's a substitute for the ship, hooks on to the cargo in preparation of the loading or after they hook on while the loading -- the lift is being hoisted and remain so until the tackle let's go of the cargo after this is discharged.","start":286.864,"stop":318.766,"duration":31.9},{"text":"But aside from that the -- as I've just stated, the Act puts burden upon the carrier to load, properly load and carefully load, handle, store, care, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried.","start":318.766,"stop":333.769,"duration":15},{"text":"And then in Section 4, I think, of the Act 1304, it is provided that the carrier is only liable not exceeding the sum of $500 per package in case of loss or damage.","start":333.769,"stop":354.159,"duration":20.39},{"text":"Unless there are some circumstances of which we are not concerned here.","start":354.159,"stop":359.517,"duration":5.36},{"text":"And then it also provides that the carrier might agree or stipulate that during the time before loading takes place or before the time the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act takes effect and after the time loading is discharged while the goods are still in the carrier's custody that the carrier might stipulate and agree as to what his liability will be during those times before and after the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act is effective.","start":359.517,"stop":396.976,"duration":37.46},{"text":"Now, in this particular case, the contracts of carriage as evidenced by the bills of lading also prescribed that if there was fault, if there was damage or liability, the carrier's liability should not exceed $500 per package.","start":396.976,"stop":413.433,"duration":16.46},{"text":"So, we have practically the same limitation provision into Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and in the bills of lading.","start":413.433,"stop":423.002,"duration":9.57},{"text":"Now, the facts of this case and only by stating what they are, yes I did, this Act had fallen -- fallen.","start":423.002,"stop":433.32,"duration":10.32},{"text":"Now, this old question if Your Honor please in these cases whether or not that contract in stevedore, an expert stevedore has the right to benefit from these limitation provisions in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and also in contracts of carriage as evidenced from bills of lading.","start":433.32,"stop":453.688,"duration":20.37},{"text":"Now, certainly when the Act was passed in 1936, it was well-known that the crew of the vessel which in former times, loaded and discharged cargos could not do that anymore.","start":453.688,"stop":473.037,"duration":19.35},{"text":"It was well-known it was impossible for them to do it and it was well-known that they did not do it.","start":473.037,"stop":479.63,"duration":6.59},{"text":"And this Court in the -- in the Seas Shipping Company versus Sieracki has recognized that the shipowner has the right to conduct his business by securing the advantages of specialization in labor and skill brought about by modern divisions of labors such as employing stevedores.","start":479.63,"stop":502.635,"duration":23},{"text":"So therefore, we contend if Your Honor please, that when this Act was passed, the real purpose of it was to say to a carrier, “Now here, these are the things you must do.","start":502.635,"stop":515.015,"duration":12.38},{"text":"You will be liable for certain things.","start":515.015,"stop":517.674,"duration":2.66},{"text":"You will be liable for $500 per package unless there are particular circumstances which we are not concerned here now.","start":517.674,"stop":524.514,"duration":6.84},{"text":"Now, we know -- we know that you must employ agents to do a great deal of this work such as loading and discharging.","start":524.514,"stop":533.323,"duration":8.81},{"text":"But it is up to you, you will be held responsible.”","start":533.323,"stop":537.124,"duration":3.8},{"text":"Now therefore, we maintain, if Your Honor, please, that when the petitioner was loading this cargo of this ship, he was doing it.","start":537.124,"stop":545.329,"duration":8.2},{"text":"It was doing it in furtherance of the terms of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and in furtherance of the terms of the contracts of carriage as evidenced by the bills of lading.","start":545.329,"stop":557.771,"duration":12.44},{"text":"And we believe therefore, that they should be allowed to benefit by the terms of the Act and by the terms of the contract.","start":557.771,"stop":564.94,"duration":7.17},{"text":"Now, if they're not so allowed, it does occur to us that the shippers certainly will be getting something they did not bargain for.","start":564.94,"stop":573.935,"duration":8.99},{"text":"In other words, they would be obtaining a windfall.","start":573.935,"stop":577.344,"duration":3.41},{"text":"And they didn't bargain for it.","start":577.344,"stop":578.741,"duration":1.4},{"text":"They're getting -- they were -- they -- they represented, the cargo was worth $500 per package.","start":578.741,"stop":586.515,"duration":7.77},{"text":"They've paid freight on it and they're getting -- if they get more than $500 per package, they're getting more than they bargained for, more than the statute authorized, and more than the statute contemplated.","start":586.515,"stop":600.632,"duration":14.12},{"text":"Now this case was up by in the Circuit Court of Appeals -- a similar case was up in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 1952.","start":600.632,"stop":610.126,"duration":9.49},{"text":"Certiorari was denied in that case.","start":610.126,"stop":612.076,"duration":1.95},{"text":"That's a case of A.M. Collins & Company and Panama Railroad Company.","start":612.076,"stop":615.891,"duration":3.81},{"text":"In that case, the Steamship Company employed the Panama Railroad Company as a stevedore to discharge some freezer units and discharged with them -- one them was dropped and damaged.","start":615.891,"stop":629.975,"duration":14.08},{"text":"The Panama Railroad Company was sued by the owner of the freezer unit and claimed, of course, that the -- the Panama Railroad Company could not benefit either from the -- by the limitation provisions either from the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act or the provision -- the similar provision in the bill of lading which controlled that shipment.","start":629.975,"stop":652.374,"duration":22.4},{"text":"But the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held otherwise.","start":652.374,"stop":656.946,"duration":4.57},{"text":"It was by a divided court.","start":656.946,"stop":659.21,"duration":2.26},{"text":"But Circuit Judge Rives wrote a very good opinion in which he pointed out that it was known -- it must have been known when this Act was passed, that this loading and discharging was done by expert stevedores and while they were not strictly parties to it, they were parties to this extent that they were doing what the owner was compelled to do and doing what the owner -- and -- and doing what was necessary in furtherance of -- in furtherance of carrying out the terms of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and the contracts of carriers.","start":659.21,"stop":697.158,"duration":37.95},{"text":"Now, that case has been followed and approved by the Second Circuit and by many lower courts and stood including this -- including federal and state, including the Court of Appeals for the State of New York.","start":697.158,"stop":714.191,"duration":17.03},{"text":"The only United States Court, as I know of, and only one I can find out that refused to follow the Collins decision was the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the case of International Milling Company versus Nicholson Transit Company.","start":714.191,"stop":731.591,"duration":17.4},{"text":"In that case, it seems like the master of the steamship was sued for some damage which occurred in the collision and the master set up as a defense, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.","start":731.591,"stop":743.85,"duration":12.26},{"text":"And the -- that Court -- the Michigan Court held that he was a stranger to the terms of the Act.","start":743.85,"stop":750.22,"duration":6.37},{"text":"He had no rights under it and in so deciding, it cited Judge Thompson's opinion, in the District Court and -- and the -- the dissenting opinion of Circuit Judge Holmes in the Collins case.","start":750.22,"stop":765.261,"duration":15.04},{"text":"That's all the authority he had for it.","start":765.261,"stop":767.863,"duration":2.6}]},{"speakerName":"Charles E.

Collins case.","start":777.799,"stop":795.871,"duration":18.07},{"text":"Well, as I say this Collins decision has been approved and followed by the Second Circuit and by many other cases and the only

the High Court of Australia.","start":810.768,"stop":837.163,"duration":26.39},{"text":"Now there were two dissenting opinions in that case.","start":837.163,"stop":841.938,"duration":4.77},{"text":"That case, the Court of New South Wales was reversed in that Wilson case by the High Court of Australia by three votes to two.","start":841.938,"stop":852.515,"duration":10.58},{"text":"The two -- there were two very good dissenting opinions but went -- went right along with the reasoning of Judge Rives in the Collins

case.","start":861.232,"stop":869.206,"duration":7.97},{"text":"We believe therefore that those dissenting opinions are more in accord with what the law is and what it ought to be than the majority opinion because the majority opinions take right up and are based or solely on the proposition that the stevedores could not possibly have any rights because they were strangers to the contract and it didn't make any difference to them whether there was a contract or not, or if there was a contract with the contract provided for.","start":869.206,"stop":902.102,"duration":32.9},{"text":"We believe therefore, Your Honors please, that the dissenting opinions in this Wilson case is certainly are more reasonable than the majority opinion because certainly, the petitioner in this case was not any stranger to this contract.","start":902.102,"stop":915.505,"duration":13.4},{"text":"As a matter of fact, the petitioner in this case signed the bills of lading itself, pursuant to the authority and instructions of the master of the vessel.","start":915.505,"stop":925.458,"duration":9.95},{"text":"So, when he was working, the petitioner was working pursuant to the bills of lading.","start":925.458,"stop":933.413,"duration":7.96},{"text":"Now, there is one case where the other side and also Judge Holmes in his dissenting opinion relied upon.","start":933.413,"stop":940.098,"duration":6.68},{"text":"And that was the decision of this Court rendered in 1916, Reid versus the American Express Company.","start":940.098,"stop":948.453,"duration":8.36},{"text":"Now, in that case, Judge -- Judge Rives and his majority opinion in the Collins case dealt with it and he pointed out that it is true that in the Reid case, of course, it was decided long before there was a Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.","start":948.453,"stop":966.503,"duration":18.05},{"text":"But further than that, the -- the stevedore in the Reid case never claimed there was a limitation of liability in the bill of lading.","start":966.503,"stop":977.025,"duration":10.52},{"text":"The stevedore, the expert or contracting stevedore whom the shipowner had employed to do the loading or discharging never claimed that he was entitled to the limitation.","start":977.025,"stop":986.722,"duration":9.7},{"text":"So, the
