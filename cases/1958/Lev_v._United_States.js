before the Court recessed, I had alluded to the fact that the state of the record, one of the first that went up on appeal, was that there had been a prior statement given by the witness Carlin, concerning the events to which he had testified upon the trial, and I submit, of course, at this point that on that state of the record, at that particular time in view of the fact that the Jencks case followed shortly thereafter, in the Court of Appeals, a reversal would have been required, probably with a remand.","start":12.614,"stop":47.423,"duration":34.81},{"text":"Undoubtedly, the Government was aware of that particular circumstance because, as I also said a short time ago, about a year later, they filed this memorandum to which I have made reference and a -- an affidavit in support of the memorandum.","start":47.423,"stop":68.378,"duration":20.96},{"text":"That memorandum, among other things, established -- it believed the following, that Belavan and Pool, the Senate investigators, had had an interview with Carlin in March of 1955, some three years prior.","start":68.378,"stop":86.936,"duration":18.56},{"text":"That, according to Belavan, this was the only interview that he quote “recalls”.","start":86.936,"stop":95.874,"duration":8.94},{"text":"He then stated that, on information and belief, he did not believe that Mr. Pool had -- had any other interview with Carlin but that he did not know Pool's whereabouts at this particular time.","start":95.874,"stop":110.174,"duration":14.3},{"text":"Of course, 3500, Title 18 U.S.C. 3500 had come down prior -- and had been passed by Congress prior to the time that this particular affidavit was filed.","start":110.174,"stop":123.504,"duration":13.33},{"text":"So, Mr. Belavan, in preparing his affidavit, then, said in the words of the statute that he had summarized generally what Carlin had told him during the course of this interview, that this was not signed or adopted by Mr. Carlin but that he had prepared it purely for Chief Counsel Kennedy of the Committee, before whom Carlin was subsequently, some six months after the signing of the statement or the giving of the statement, before which Committee he testified.","start":123.504,"stop":160.426,"duration":36.92},{"text":"He then said, also in the words of the statute, according to his affidavit, that the memoranda was not a substantially verbatim recital.","start":160.426,"stop":171.392,"duration":10.97},{"text":"So, I say this are the words of the statute adopted in the affidavit and, undoubtedly, with an eye on the statute.","start":171.392,"stop":177.973,"duration":6.58},{"text":"Of course, I point out to the Court immediately that these are merely conclusions of the witness or the affiant in this particular case as to what the memoranda showed.","start":177.973,"stop":191.773,"duration":13.8},{"text":"Now, when the Government filed that particular memoranda supported by this affidavit, a number of questions of fact, as we view it, arose in the Court of Appeals, one, there was certainly an issue as to whether or not there was a signed statement.","start":191.773,"stop":208.384,"duration":16.61},{"text":"And, according to Carlin, there was.","start":208.384,"stop":210.947,"duration":2.56},{"text":"Two, even if there had not been a signed statement had there been a statement which had been adopted or accepted in any fashion by Mr Carlin.","start":210.947,"stop":223.577,"duration":12.63},{"text":"And, thirdly, was it a substantially verbatim recital of what -- of an oral statement of the witness.","start":223.577,"stop":230.443,"duration":6.87},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, this we are most critical, decided, one, that there was no other statement and it did that purely by reference to the ex parte affidavit of Belavan without any cross-examination or inquiry being permitted into the matter whatsoever, by petitioner or any of the other defendants.","start":230.443,"stop":253.41,"duration":22.97},{"text":"It also decided that the statement had never been adopted in any fashion by Mr. Carlin and, I submit most respectfully to this Court that the only way that the court below could have reached that conclusion would be by a full and complete 100% reliance upon what Mr. Belavan said in his ex parte affidavit, again, without having it tested by cross-examination of anyone.","start":253.41,"stop":280.401,"duration":26.99}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Then -- was there

document.","start":330.358,"stop":343.239,"duration":12.88},{"text":"That seemed to be the rule in virtually every other Circuit, except the Second Circuit, at that particular time.","start":343.239,"stop":348.856,"duration":5.62},{"text":"Now, the third question which was before the Court was whether or not this was a substantially verbatim recital of the oral statement given by Carlin.","start":348.856,"stop":357.513,"duration":8.66},{"text":"And, the Court decided that, since Mr. Belavan had so characterized it, it was.","start":357.513,"stop":364.238,"duration":6.73},{"text":"But, it went on in this particular instance to say that it had examined the internal evidence, which I put in quotes, “Itself and that internal evidence tended to bare out the statement of Mr. Belavan that it was not a substantially verbatim recital.”","start":364.238,"stop":385.514,"duration":21.28},{"text":"Now, we submit again, I say to the Court, most respectfully, that with these three questions of fact at large that it was most improper for the Court of Appeals to decide this case purely on the ex parte affidavits of Mr. Belavan.","start":385.514,"stop":404.2,"duration":18.69},{"text":"And, it did decide it in this fashion, against petitioners.","start":404.2,"stop":407.474,"duration":3.27},{"text":"It stated that, while it was true that under Jencks it was error for the trial court to deny the petitioners the Carlin statement.","start":407.474,"stop":419.81,"duration":12.34},{"text":"Nevertheless, Congress had seen fit to pass, 18 U.S.C. 3500, sometimes referred to as the Jencks Act, and that had a very narrow definition as to what statements were, that a summa -- a general summary of what a witness had told a government agent was obviously not within the -- within the purview of the statute and, therefore, in the event of a new trial, it would not be open to the petitioners and, therefore, he affirmed the conviction.","start":419.81,"stop":454.06,"duration":34.25}]},{"speakerName":"Charles E.

gentleman who opened up the cross-examination as to Carlin.","start":473.492,"stop":488.94,"duration":15.45},{"text":"He was the very first.","start":488.94,"stop":490.914,"duration":1.97},{"text":"He

under the Court's instructions, the familiar, usual, basic instructions are always given in conspiracy cases, he was tied to Rubin.","start":521.501,"stop":538.936,"duration":17.44},{"text":"And, Rubin was largely, very, very largely implicated in the statement of Carlin.","start":538.936,"stop":547.04,"duration":8.1},{"text":"But, I say there was no point at that time in petitioner's

to be content to take Judge Kaufman's ruling at the time.","start":564.553,"stop":568.855,"duration":4.3},{"text":"And, if you ever get a chance to examine the trial record here, you will understand why, because the Judge is very short with counsel and had been short with them all the way during the trial and, although I was not in the trial, I've examined the record and it appears to me that counsel was somewhat intimidated, particularly, in view of the fact that the Court had already announced what his ruling would be on this type of thing.","start":568.855,"stop":592.167,"duration":23.31},{"text":"No one again ever made any such objection and, of course, I point out to the Court that Jencks had not come down and there was some authority at the particular time with some courts, not the majority view but the minority view, that a foundation of inconsistency had to be laid before there could be any production even to the Court in the very first instance.","start":592.167,"stop":613.028,"duration":20.86},{"text":"In any event, the record makes clear that no one again made any objection.","start":613.028,"stop":619.975,"duration":6.95},{"text":"As I said before, may it please the Court, the -- we regard this error as a most serious error and we think, apart form the question as to whether or not this was a substantially verbatim recital, that the denial of the cross-examination alone to show whether or not there was not another written statement or that this statement had not been adopted or signed was most serious.","start":619.975,"stop":643.943,"duration":23.97},{"text":"I point out again to Your Honors that, in adopting or signing a statement, it is not necessary, really, that a person sign it.","start":643.943,"stop":652.051,"duration":8.11},{"text":"He might conceivably be in a room when his statement is read to him and, if he remained silent under such circumstances, as a reasonable man would speak out, that might, in itself, be an acknowledgement.","start":652.051,"stop":664.683,"duration":12.63},{"text":"Nobody was given the right,

point to the language of the Court in which it finds that this was a substantially -- it was not a substantially verbatim recital.","start":675.954,"stop":684.639,"duration":8.69},{"text":"There is no positive language there whatsoever.","start":684.639,"stop":687.362,"duration":2.72},{"text":"The Court seem to, and that is the court below, seem to equivocate when it said that this internal evidence tends to bear this out, that this was not a substantially verbatim statement.","start":687.362,"stop":699.734,"duration":12.37},{"text":"I think, had we been given the right to cross-examine,

Quartermaster Corps Office in New York for the purpose of inducing them to disclose confidential information prior to the awarding of any contract by the Quartermaster Corps to corruptly grant

favors.","start":324.076,"stop":344.331,"duration":20.25},{"text":"He also said that, due to his acquaintanceship with these people and the fact that he would be turning over such money to them, that

work under that contract.","start":344.331,"stop":366.909,"duration":22.58},{"text":"At the conclusion of his testimony, Mr. Sullivan, who will appear here before you on cross-examination, was able to
