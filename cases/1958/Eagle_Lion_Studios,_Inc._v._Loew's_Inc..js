three-judge court in the Paramount case had found that RKO and Loew's circuits in New York had monopolized the first neighborhood run in that city and had divided that market so that there was no competition between them in obtaining pictures for their theaters.","start":13.973,"stop":36.84,"duration":22.87},{"text":"We had also noted that that finding as to New York was not made in installation but rather in the context of the findings as to the overall nationwide monopolization found in the Paramount case.","start":36.84,"stop":51.161,"duration":14.32},{"text":"In other words, the Court in the Paramount case found an interdependency between the respective defendants.","start":51.161,"stop":59.94,"duration":8.78},{"text":"So that you had in a sense a back-scratching situation created.","start":59.94,"stop":65.107,"duration":5.17},{"text":"In other words, RKO and Loew happen to have the theater monopolization in New York.","start":65.107,"stop":70.793,"duration":5.69},{"text":"But Paramount had it in Chicago and Fox had it on the West Coast.","start":70.793,"stop":75.193,"duration":4.4},{"text":"And quite clearly, if RKO and Loew wished to get reciprocal preferential treatment in Chicago and in Los Angeles, they had an obligation in New York where they control the circuit theaters to take care of their co-conspirator defendants.","start":75.193,"stop":92.113,"duration":16.92},{"text":"We had concluded on Monday as the Court may recall by noting that the main issue or one of the main issues in this case was as the Court of Appeals pointed out in the record at page 692, one of the issues set up in the pretrial order was, \"Did the defendants combine and conspire in violation of the antitrust laws of the United States to exclude the plaintiffs from the opportunity of licensing on a competitive basis their feature motion pictures to Loew and RKO theaters which exhibit feature motion pictures in the New York Metropolitan area on runs subsequent to first Broadway?\"","start":92.113,"stop":132.48,"duration":40.37},{"text":"In other words, the primary and first issue in the case was whether or not the two defendants here had conspired to deny independent distributors like Eagle Lion the opportunity of licensing on a competitive basis their feature motion pictures.","start":132.48,"stop":149.998,"duration":17.52},{"text":"And we ended on Monday by noting as far as the petitions are concerned that in our judgment, there's a fundamental inconsistency between a finding such as you have in the Paramount case that RKO and Loew monopolized the first neighborhood run in New York and a finding that the independent such as ourselves were still free to license our product to those two circuits on a competitive basis.","start":149.998,"stop":179.868,"duration":29.87},{"text":"Now, we suggest further, if the Court please, that any possible doubt about the invidious impact of that kind of a monopolization upon an independent like ourselves is resolved when we stop to consider the manner in which the two monopolist undertook to implement their monopoly power.","start":179.868,"stop":201.417,"duration":21.55},{"text":"In other words, when we stop to consider the mechanics whereby they operated these two circuits.","start":201.417,"stop":208.823,"duration":7.41},{"text":"The fact is that during the four years involved here, the two circuits pursue a playing policy in the administration of their monopoly power that necessarily had the effect of curtailing that market, that tremendously important first neighborhood market in New York.","start":208.823,"stop":225.682,"duration":16.86},{"text":"So that it not only could not accommodate pictures by independents like ourselves, but there wasn't even enough preferential playing time to accommodate the pictures of their own assigned co-conspirators.","start":225.682,"stop":241.692,"duration":16.01},{"text":"Now, that situation resulted from the fact that the two circuits had broken the week down into an arbitrary long half composed of five or six days as they saw fit and a so-called short half composed of one or two days.","start":241.692,"stop":257.555,"duration":15.86},{"text":"The long half, as the Court will appreciate, was really the line share of the long half, five or six days.","start":257.555,"stop":265.404,"duration":7.85},{"text":"They played a double bill on both half, the long half and the short half.","start":265.404,"stop":270.736,"duration":5.33},{"text":"But only the so-called top feature picture on the long half of the week was allowed to earn a percentage of gross rental.","start":270.736,"stop":279.045,"duration":8.31},{"text":"And this was really the only desirable rental position on the entire circuit play.","start":279.045,"stop":284.384,"duration":5.34},{"text":"That top feature on the long half was granted a percentage of gross as its rental.","start":284.384,"stop":290.419,"duration":6.03},{"text":"The second feature on the long half and these two features over on the short half were all paid an arbitrary flat rental which was much less desirable as both courts below found.","start":290.419,"stop":303.879,"duration":13.46},{"text":"So that, you had a situation, if the Court please, where the 100 or more theaters comprising the two circuits plus the 600 theaters in the subsequent runs have played off these two circuits.","start":303.879,"stop":316.58,"duration":12.7},{"text":"All of those theaters were confined to utilizing only 52 pictures in each circuit in that top feature position, on the preferential rental term, only 52 feature pictures per year.","start":316.58,"stop":330.932,"duration":14.35},{"text":"In other words, the two circuits taken together could only consume a 104 pictures per year.","start":330.932,"stop":337.444,"duration":6.51},{"text":"And this during a period of time when their own assigned co-conspiring distributors were producing 250 pictures per year.","start":337.444,"stop":347.204,"duration":9.76},{"text":"Even if you took both of these positions on the -- on the long half, the top feature and the second feature, the flat rental picture, you still only had a 104 pictures there, a 104 pictures on the other circuit, 208 is the total.","start":347.204,"stop":361.67,"duration":14.47},{"text":"And again, during a period of time when the co-conspiring distributors were themselves producing 250 pictures per year.","start":361.67,"stop":371.31,"duration":9.64},{"text":"Now, we suggest that -- that sort of a playing policy tends to make graphically explicit, what we think is perfectly explicit on the face of the Paramount judgement anyway and that is that the circuits did not have enough time to accommodate properly their own codefendants much less have anytime left over for independence like ourselves.","start":371.31,"stop":395.79,"duration":24.48},{"text":"At best, it seems to us perfectly obvious that the most that remain for an independent distributor like Eagle Lion was the marginable playing time if any that worked out in the course of the year.","start":395.79,"stop":407.475,"duration":11.69},{"text":"In other words, we got the crumbs that fell from the board if any there were and we didn't get many crumbs.","start":407.475,"stop":416.548,"duration":9.07},{"text":"Indeed, in the four years involved here, we succeeded in placing only eight of our -- 196 pictures in either one of those top feature positions on either the Loew or the RKO circuit.","start":416.548,"stop":430.544,"duration":14},{"text":"So, we contend that quite apart from the Paramount case itself that the playing policy pursued by these two circuits to implement the monopoly power that is implicit on the face of the Paramount decision necessarily resulted in such as a narrowly, a severely narrowed market for independents like ourselves that you have not only liability on the antitrust laws but you have clearly the fact of injury to ourselves because we have compelled to sell not only in a noncompetitive market, but we were compelled to sell in a market that was deliberately and so arbitrarily narrowed that from the operation of the conspiracy itself.","start":430.544,"stop":472.209,"duration":41.67},{"text":"It was clear that there was little of any playing time for the independents.","start":472.209,"stop":478.761,"duration":6.55},{"text":"Now, that being the case, if the Court please, we come to the question of how appropriately to measure the impact on us, an independent distributor of that conspiracy.","start":478.761,"stop":492.968,"duration":14.21},{"text":"In the Bigelow case, Bigelow versus RKO, 327 U.S., this Court many years ago restated the wrongdoer rule.","start":492.968,"stop":503.013,"duration":10.04},{"text":"That is the principle that once an antitrust violation is established, the risk and the jeopardy of determining with certainty or uncertainty as the case maybe the impact of that conspiracy upon the victim of the conspiracy, the risk in jeopardy of trying to evaluate that impact is cast not upon the victim, but upon the wrongdoer.","start":503.013,"stop":529.649,"duration":26.64},{"text":"This Court speaking to Mr. Chief Justice Stone who wrote the majority opinion there said, and I quote from page 265, “The wrongdoer may not object to the plaintiff's reasonable estimate of the cause of injury and of its amount because it's not based on more accurate data which the wrongdoer's misconduct has rendered unavailable”.","start":529.649,"stop":557.842,"duration":28.19},{"text":"Of course, it is perfectly obvious I think to all of us that after a monopolization, it is never possible to go back and

the Chief -- the former Chief Justice of this Court indicated in the Bigelow case and that is, undertake in the area of the violation in the market allegedly monopolized, undertake to compare the
