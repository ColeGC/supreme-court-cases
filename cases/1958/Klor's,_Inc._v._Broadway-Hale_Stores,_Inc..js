Honor.","start":422.396,"stop":427.377,"duration":4.98},{"text":"The judgment rendered by the District Court was both on the -- based upon the lack of cause of action and was based upon the lack of facts to show issues between the parties under the antitrust laws.","start":427.377,"stop":445.315,"duration":17.94},{"text":"As a matter of fact, this affidavit in summary judgments showed the courts below that there was indeed a group refusal to deal.","start":445.315,"stop":453.71,"duration":8.39},{"text":"The affidavit showed two things.","start":453.71,"stop":455.554,"duration":1.84},{"text":"Number one, that there were a number of other competitors in the San Francisco area.","start":455.554,"stop":460.849,"duration":5.3},{"text":"They were merely names set forth on a piece of paper.","start":460.849,"stop":464.812,"duration":3.96},{"text":"They showed that there are a lot of these competitors in the San Francisco Bay area.","start":464.812,"stop":468.715,"duration":3.9},{"text":"And number two, they showed that there were other brand names available to the petitioner here other than the respondents named in the complaint.","start":468.715,"stop":477.318,"duration":8.6},{"text":"But they also showed as you go through the record as to each affidavit filed by each respondent that there was no delivery of their merchandise to Klor in the supposedly competitive market.","start":477.318,"stop":491.105,"duration":13.79},{"text":"There was no explanation

16.","start":502.012,"stop":510.593,"duration":8.58},{"text":"In short, all that's we have are these hybrid affidavit in summary judgment.","start":510.593,"stop":514.755,"duration":4.16},{"text":"Based upon this record showing this group refusal to deal, this uncontested allegations of monopolistic chain buying power.","start":514.755,"stop":522.376,"duration":7.62},{"text":"The lower court said, “There was no substantiality either in law or in substance to exercise the Court's jurisdiction to protect the single trader.”","start":522.376,"stop":534.66,"duration":12.28},{"text":"And this was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that there was no showing of public injury.","start":534.66,"stop":543.627,"duration":8.97},{"text":"And by this, I take it to mean that the antitrust laws are limited in their purpose and scope to showing conduct which has a direct injurious effect on the public such as price fixing and some other type of conduct upon which there's a direct effect on the consumer or the public.","start":543.627,"stop":568.751,"duration":25.12},{"text":"This decision was made after this Court had ruled in the Radovich case that the doctrine of public injury as used by the court below

public.","start":584.288,"stop":600.25,"duration":15.96},{"text":"The writ involved this question of public injury.","start":600.25,"stop":602.936,"duration":2.69},{"text":"And this Court specifically met the problem and stated in the opinion that when Congress passes an act, the violation of that act itself creates a public wrong and that the antitrust laws protect the victims of forbidden conduct as well as the public.","start":602.936,"stop":620.153,"duration":17.22},{"text":"The decision below is clearly erroneous for three reasons.","start":620.153,"stop":624.909,"duration":4.76},{"text":"Number one, it is an improper interpretation of the scope and the purposes and the objectives of the antitrust laws.","start":624.909,"stop":632.336,"duration":7.43},{"text":"Number two, it refused to apply the rule of this Court that group boycotts to or group refusal to deal are illegal per se.","start":632.336,"stop":640.563,"duration":8.23},{"text":"And that the mere entry into this agreement is forbidden conduct.","start":640.563,"stop":645.177,"duration":4.61},{"text":"And third, to refuse to give to an antitrust complaint and an antitrust litigant the most elementary rules of Federal Civil Procedure, construction of a complaint in favor of the private litigant, construction of the complaint to see what maybe offered to prove the allegations in the complaint.","start":645.177,"stop":663.43,"duration":18.25},{"text":"Now, as to the first contention of error, the antitrust laws of course protect the public from predatory conduct or from conduct which is designed to gouge them of -- of a dollar.","start":663.43,"stop":675.227,"duration":11.8},{"text":"But clearly, this is not the only purpose and objective of the Congress in -- in enacting the antirust laws and as interpreted by this Court, we may pickup the Attorney General's National Committee to study the antitrust laws and turn to the very first page of this report and see the heading, “A policy against undo limitations or competitive conditions.”","start":675.227,"stop":698.236,"duration":23.01},{"text":"And -- and read the statement, “The general objective of the antitrust law does promotion of competition in open

long recognized that opportunity for market access and fostering of market rivalry are basic tenants of our faith and compettion as a form of economical organization.”","start":711.308,"stop":726.328,"duration":15.02},{"text":"Someone is -- that the antitrust law has act to prohibit conduct which unduly limits competitive opportunity.","start":726.328,"stop":733.981,"duration":7.65},{"text":"And this is regardless of any effect on the public any direct effect.","start":733.981,"stop":737.331,"duration":3.35},{"text":"The public is protected by having every trader that wants to get into the market place compete for that consumer by special -- by using his ingenuity, his ability and his skills in the market place.","start":737.331,"stop":751.569,"duration":14.24},{"text":"And I think when we're talking in terms of substance, we have to get down to the very core of the antitrust laws.","start":751.569,"stop":758.114,"duration":6.55},{"text":"And that very core is that every man in this country has an opportunity to go upon the market, and to obtain profits, and to obtain the right to let his abilities and ingenuities and skills determine whether or not he shall succeed or fail.","start":758.114,"stop":776.538,"duration":18.42},{"text":"The proper proposition is set forth, vest by Senator Sherman when he discussed the enactment of the Sherman Act.","start":776.538,"stop":784.794,"duration":8.26},{"text":"It is the right of every man to work labor and produce in any lawful vocation, and to transport his production on equal terms and conditions under a like circumstances.","start":784.794,"stop":797.049,"duration":12.25},{"text":"This is industrial liberty and lies at the foundation of the equality of all rights and privileges.","start":797.049,"stop":803.275,"duration":6.23},{"text":"I submit that when Congress passed the antitrust laws, it enacted this policy as far as the constitutional power over interstate commerce could go.","start":803.275,"stop":814.177,"duration":10.9},{"text":"That every man should be free of conspiracies in the use of monopoly power when he enters into a free and open

free of predatory conduct directed at suppressing and eliminating his competition.","start":822.298,"stop":836.507,"duration":14.21},{"text":"Secondly, the Court erred because it did not apply the per se rule of group refusal to deal.","start":836.507,"stop":844.198,"duration":7.69},{"text":"This course -- this Court has stated many times that a group refusal to deal is in -- is illegal per
