merit.","start":626.364,"stop":633.646,"duration":7.28},{"text":"Then having open the door or carved out an area that they could review the Board's award, they walked through it and said, “Let's

disobedience justified and was the holding of the hearing in his absence a violation of the agreement?","start":653.908,"stop":666.578,"duration":12.67},{"text":"They concluded that the question as to Price's disobedience being justified was the merit of the case.","start":666.578,"stop":676.416,"duration":9.84},{"text":"And they said that the Board has misunderstood the case.","start":676.416,"stop":679.656,"duration":3.24},{"text":"The Board has misconstrued Price's submission.","start":679.656,"stop":682.689,"duration":3.03},{"text":"They even went so far as to try

opinion.","start":687.937,"stop":690.769,"duration":2.83},{"text":"They held that since the Board did not pass upon what they determine to be the merit, that the award was not final and binding.","start":690.769,"stop":699.1,"duration":8.33},{"text":"Now, it is significant to know that the court below is very, very candid.","start":699.1,"stop":704.288,"duration":5.19},{"text":"They said that this question was simply a dispute over the grounds relied upon by the Board in reaching its denial award which all parties could see to have been unambiguous.","start":704.288,"stop":719.383,"duration":15.1},{"text":"Now, I just submit that in its quest for the merit, its unnecessarily search for the merit, the court below confused arguments advanced by the respondent, Price, in support of his claim with the ultimate question which he presented to the Board.","start":719.383,"stop":737.194,"duration":17.81},{"text":"And the ultimate question was, “Could Price be reinstated with pay?”","start":737.194,"stop":741.2,"duration":4.01},{"text":"And the Board said, “No.”","start":741.2,"stop":743.824,"duration":2.62},{"text":"Now, anyone of the arguments that were advanced by Price, have they been accepted by the Board?","start":743.824,"stop":749.656,"duration":5.83},{"text":"An award sustaining his claim for back pay and reinstatement would have been an issue.","start":749.656,"stop":757.133,"duration":7.48},{"text":"Justice Brennan has brought up this question of the interpretation subsequent to the Court of Appeals
