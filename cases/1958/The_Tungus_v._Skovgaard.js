but in number three hatch, she has two deep tanks which are used apparently for carrying of oil or for dry cargo.","start":43.497,"stop":54.393,"duration":10.9},{"text":"To that in the Philippine

cargo.","start":70.923,"stop":77.921,"duration":7},{"text":"By the same token, the consignee in this country had the same obligation, namely, to supervise the unloading of the cargo.","start":77.921,"stop":87.286,"duration":9.36},{"text":"Now, when the vessel came to New York -- I might say too that that contract was incorporated in the bill of lading so that became part of the contract of carriage.","start":87.286,"stop":97.37,"duration":10.08},{"text":"When the vessel arrived in New York, she discharged general cargo in Brooklyn.","start":97.37,"stop":102.043,"duration":4.67},{"text":"And while there, she received order to proceed to the El Dorado Oil Plant in Bayonne, New

people who had received this contract from the owners of the oil not only to discharge it but to store it, have made arrangements for Mr. Skovgaard, the decedent, to examine and prepare an electric pump for the discharge of this oil.","start":111.935,"stop":129.655,"duration":17.72},{"text":"Under his guidance, one of the repairman placed this oil on a pallet or skid and took it down for the string piece on the dock.","start":129.655,"stop":138.716,"duration":9.06},{"text":"After the vessel's arrival, a Mr. Sexton, an El Dorado supervisor, came aboard the vessel, examined the oil, took samples, and not being satisfied that the oil was pure, ordered the discharge to commence.","start":138.716,"stop":153.315,"duration":14.6},{"text":"Now, after the vessel tied up the crew as customary after 5 o'clock were on the shore with the exception of two men and an officer, were always on guard on the vessel to watch the lines on tidal waters.","start":153.315,"stop":167.323,"duration":14.01},{"text":"El Dorado didn't have anybody to run the winches so the two crewman ran the winches.","start":167.323,"stop":172.695,"duration":5.37},{"text":"Before doing that, they went down, that is the El Dorado people, went down in this tank.","start":172.695,"stop":178.363,"duration":5.67},{"text":"It's about nine feet long and about three feet wide.","start":178.363,"stop":181.59,"duration":3.23},{"text":"And they took the lid off that tank and turned it at a 90-degree angle leaving about one-third of the tank open.","start":181.59,"stop":189.539,"duration":7.95},{"text":"They then brought on the electric pump and placed it on the tank lid with the suction part towards this hole.","start":189.539,"stop":197.602,"duration":8.06},{"text":"Now, every part of this pump, the hoses, the air injection lines, every part of it belong to El Dorado.","start":197.602,"stop":205.331,"duration":7.73},{"text":"They supplied electricity from the shore to run the pump, and they had a man there sets just where he wanted the pump placed.","start":205.331,"stop":213.594,"duration":8.26},{"text":"The pump was placed in that position and an answer to interrogatory, it was admitted that this pump was such and it required a man alongside the pump at all times.","start":213.594,"stop":223.822,"duration":10.23},{"text":"About 9 o'clock that night, the officer on watch checking his lines and walking around the deck looked down and saw that the pump was smoking.","start":223.822,"stop":232.026,"duration":8.2},{"text":"Not knowing anything about the pump, it was necessary for him to run ashore, which he did, brought an El

man who came aboard.","start":241.063,"stop":247.37,"duration":6.31},{"text":"About 12:15, just after midnight, the third officer was taken over.","start":247.37,"stop":253.376,"duration":6.01},{"text":"They watched, looked down and saw that this pump was leaking.","start":253.376,"stop":257.676,"duration":4.3},{"text":"And then they say at this point, it was leaking to what they call a nipple.","start":257.676,"stop":261.916,"duration":4.24},{"text":"And that simply means sort of an attachment on the pump where they attached an air hose to get suction.","start":261.916,"stop":267.943,"duration":6.03},{"text":"And this nipple was an ethical part of the pump.","start":267.943,"stop":270.721,"duration":2.78},{"text":"It was created by El Dorado people from their own shop.","start":270.721,"stop":278.25,"duration":7.53},{"text":"Now, again, the crew was in a situation.","start":278.25,"stop":281.254,"duration":3},{"text":"And not knowing anything about this pump not even knowing how to turn it off.","start":281.254,"stop":285.337,"duration":4.08},{"text":"Again, we had a rundown to get somebody from the dock.","start":285.337,"stop":288.235,"duration":2.9},{"text":"And by the time he came back, there were several tons of oils went into -- between the deck.","start":288.235,"stop":293.454,"duration":5.22},{"text":"Well, the officer came out, they went down, they found that this oil had leaked down on other cargo.","start":293.454,"stop":299.372,"duration":5.92},{"text":"And that resulted in an argument to dismiss the suction because we asked them to admit and it is his responsibility and he refused to sign any papers stating that the (Inaudible) and he couldn't see.","start":299.372,"stop":311.093,"duration":11.72},{"text":"On the mean time, El Dorado had sent two people down to repair this pump.","start":311.093,"stop":316.448,"duration":5.35},{"text":"They came to shore with the loose nipple, they sit down and they tried to get suction, they couldn't get suction.","start":316.448,"stop":322.137,"duration":5.69},{"text":"They then called up the decedent who was at his home, told him of what happened and he came aboard while there was an argument going on on the deck between the chief officer and Mr. Sexton.","start":322.137,"stop":332.836,"duration":10.7},{"text":"The chief officer offered Mr. Sexton who had made an entry in the log to that effect.","start":332.836,"stop":338.004,"duration":5.17},{"text":"That you can sawdust or sand if you wanted to put on this oil.","start":338.004,"stop":342.294,"duration":4.29},{"text":"Mr. Sexton said that conversation wasn't solved but his testimony was that he was in complete charge of this oil, he looked down after the tank he intended to salvage the oil.","start":342.294,"stop":353.011,"duration":10.72},{"text":"And he looked into the tank and for what he could see, his men who were down there repairing the pump by cleaning the sufficient area.","start":353.011,"stop":360.381,"duration":7.37},{"text":"So that it was unnecessary to sufficiently clean as he saw it.","start":360.381,"stop":363.946,"duration":3.57},{"text":"And of course, the oil could not be salvaged if it were contaminated in any way by the sand or anything else that might have been put on it.","start":363.946,"stop":374.931,"duration":10.98},{"text":"And Mr. Skovgaard came aboard, stood up on the deck, looked down into the hall, and gave orders to these two men who were working on the hatch.","start":374.931,"stop":382.546,"duration":7.62},{"text":"He walked around up above and eventually he went down into the hatch.","start":382.546,"stop":386.823,"duration":4.28},{"text":"He stood up, went into the -- the pump, walked around through this oil it was spread all over and up and tried to step on the tank cover and in so doing slipped and fell to his death.","start":386.823,"stop":398.66,"duration":11.84},{"text":"I may say at this point that this particular pump, the ship knew nothing about it.","start":398.66,"stop":403.345,"duration":4.69},{"text":"We had no part of it.","start":403.345,"stop":404.355,"duration":1.01},{"text":"We knew nothing about it and the only man who seems to know anything about that pump was a Mr. Blaney.","start":404.355,"stop":409.964,"duration":5.61},{"text":"Mr. Blaney was chief superintendent.","start":409.964,"stop":411.971,"duration":2.01},{"text":"He came aboard immediately after the accident and then all he had to do is lower the pump and the pump worked and discharge continued the next morning.","start":411.971,"stop":421.184,"duration":9.21},{"text":"Now, fortunately, the law in this case we had the situation of having all the witnesses live and testify.","start":421.184,"stop":428.95,"duration":7.77},{"text":"And Judge Modarelli had to take the advantage of their testimony as well as watching them verbally testify in Court.","start":428.95,"stop":436.401,"duration":7.45},{"text":"And on all the evidence he held, that there was no duty here on the part of the ship to this man and dismissed -- dismissed the libel.","start":436.401,"stop":445.781,"duration":9.38},{"text":"In part, he relied on a decision of the New Jersey court that is the Workmen's Compensation Bureau, who went through this hearings.","start":445.781,"stop":455.761,"duration":9.98},{"text":"And they decided that this man was entitled to his compensation under the New Jersey Act because he was in the twilight zone and was really not working for the ship, rather was working for the people at shore.","start":455.761,"stop":469.23,"duration":13.47},{"text":"Now, in that connection I might say, sir that we have two causes of action on this case under the New Jersey Death Act one for negligence and one for unseaworthiness, and two causes of action under the survival statute.","start":469.23,"stop":489.201,"duration":19.97},{"text":"I submit sir at the very time that this libel was filed.","start":489.201,"stop":492.824,"duration":3.62},{"text":"The -- the appellant had in mind that there was no such thing as recovering except under the survival statute.","start":492.824,"stop":500.052,"duration":7.23},{"text":"But on the trial as I explained the death of this man, there was nothing left under the survival statute.","start":500.052,"stop":505.995,"duration":5.94},{"text":"He was practically dead when he fell into the tank.","start":505.995,"stop":509.182,"duration":3.19},{"text":"The effect cause has been abandoned and then we went to the Jersey Death Act.","start":509.182,"stop":513.904,"duration":4.72},{"text":"Now, in their brief, they tried to give the impression as not only a death statute -- statute, it's survival statute.","start":513.904,"stop":521.294,"duration":7.39},{"text":"And I submit it is not the -- Congress didn't intend it to be such because when Congress passed, the Death on the High Seas Act, they specifically said -- I refer to page 17 of my main brief, \"After giving a cause of action, a death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default occurring on the high seas beyond a marine league from shore.\"","start":521.294,"stop":547.959,"duration":26.66},{"text":"Now, the second provision was, the provisons of any State giving or regulating rights of action for remedy for death shall not be affected by this statute.","start":547.959,"stop":557.375,"duration":9.42},{"text":"Now, the statute of New Jersey that is a similar statute, the statutes of New Jersey has never been interpreted for the maritime law.","start":557.375,"stop":564.82,"duration":7.45},{"text":"But in similar statutes, they've always held that rather it was a limitng statute.","start":564.82,"stop":570.302,"duration":5.48},{"text":"In other words, you come up to the point if the man had a cause of action himself.","start":570.302,"stop":575.039,"duration":4.74},{"text":"But that's the Jersey legislature didn't intend that that be a survival statute or to give any more than the Jersey law gave.","start":575.039,"stop":582.618,"duration":7.58},{"text":"They then filled in the gap by giving a right of action to a -- to a survivor.","start":582.618,"stop":587.71,"duration":5.09},{"text":"That is that that cause of action which he haven't solved for pain and suffering, medical expenses and other expenses in that line.","start":587.71,"stop":595.386,"duration":7.68},{"text":"I'd also submit, sir, there's two that if we look at this statute, suppose that there were two men, left the El Dorado plant.","start":595.386,"stop":604.235,"duration":8.85},{"text":"Two men went down because the holes would leak where the oil went in to the tank on shore and the other man sent aboard the ship.","start":604.235,"stop":612.143,"duration":7.91},{"text":"I don't think it can be said that the New Jersey legislature intended in 1846 that there'd be two separate causes of action for its citizen, because I don't think there's any question about the fact the man would fall into the tank, he would only have -- have his rights that this man had them under the state act, he would have recovered his compensation.","start":612.143,"stop":633.105,"duration":20.96},{"text":"Now, on the other hand, this other man, he goes on the ship and he derives his right under the decisions of this Court from a seaman.","start":633.105,"stop":642.507,"duration":9.4},{"text":"He is a seaman.","start":642.507,"stop":644.007,"duration":1.5},{"text":"But if he were a true seaman, he would have no cause of action in this case for unseaworthiness.","start":644.007,"stop":650.429,"duration":6.42},{"text":"His -- his cause of action for unseaworthiness would die with his death.","start":650.429,"stop":654.279,"duration":3.85},{"text":"And yet, this man stands in his shoes and his right claiming under the law.","start":654.279,"stop":664.168,"duration":9.89},{"text":"Now, Mr. Baker and I assumed it will be followed up.","start":664.168,"stop":668.69,"duration":4.52},{"text":"Makes more to the fact about the case being brought in admiralty.","start":668.69,"stop":672.517,"duration":3.83},{"text":"But I think cases in this Court are uniform in holding that admiralty, and I cite them at page 20 of my brief, Western Fuel versus Garcia and Just versus Chambers.","start":672.517,"stop":685.401,"duration":12.88},{"text":"In one, Western Fuel case we say, \"Admiralty courts move in to obtain a libel in personam for damages sustained.\"","start":685.401,"stop":693.692,"duration":8.29},{"text":"And the others they say, they won't force a wrongful death act.","start":693.692,"stop":697.692,"duration":4},{"text":"And admiralty does no more and provide the forum, it doesn't provide any rights under the admiralty law.","start":697.692,"stop":704.795,"duration":7.1},{"text":"It's just the forum that admiralty law provides.","start":704.795,"stop":712.725,"duration":7.93},{"text":"Now, in the -- in the courts below, we might say it was agreed, all eight judges agreed that New Jersey's death statute was the only statute involved in this case.","start":712.725,"stop":730.005,"duration":17.28},{"text":"And under that statute, of course, Judge Modarelli held no duty with respect toward conditions growing out of the nature of the work that the man was doing at the
