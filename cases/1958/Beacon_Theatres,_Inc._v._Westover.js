standing alone were as follows.","start":109.117,"stop":117.587,"duration":8.47},{"text":"The first, that the Seventh Amendment guarantees a jury trial as to actions of law, actions of common law.","start":117.587,"stop":126.131,"duration":8.54},{"text":"This was an action for declaratory relief which is not an action at common law nor is it an action traditionally known as an action in equity.","start":126.131,"stop":135.721,"duration":9.59},{"text":"That the right to trial by jury and an action for declaratory relief turns upon the basic nature of the case and turns upon the -- the kind of the case for which the declaratory action is a substitute.","start":135.721,"stop":151.511,"duration":15.79},{"text":"That in this action, it was apparent from the face of the complaint, from the allegations contained therein that it was a substitute for an antitrust damage suit and that its basic issues were those issues.","start":151.511,"stop":168.331,"duration":16.82},{"text":"And that since under well-established rules, in antitrust damage suits, a -- the plaintiff and defendant are both entitled to a jury trial that therefore plaintiff or defendant -- petitioner here was entitled to a jury trial.","start":168.331,"stop":183.314,"duration":14.98},{"text":"The complaint to make this point was not a very lengthy one.","start":183.314,"stop":191.107,"duration":7.79},{"text":"It

page 10, the complaint appears in our record.","start":216.378,"stop":220.899,"duration":4.52},{"text":"It alleged, first, that it was brought under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act.","start":220.899,"stop":225.547,"duration":4.65},{"text":"It was entitled, “Complaint for Declaratory Judgment”.","start":225.547,"stop":228.634,"duration":3.09},{"text":"But in the second paragraph of the complaint after the first, as one sentence, there was alleged that there was a controversy in excess of $3000.","start":228.634,"stop":238.066,"duration":9.43},{"text":"And that the matter in controversy arises under the law of the United States to which Sections 1 and 2 of the Act of Congress of July 2nd entitled, “An Act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies”, commonly known as the Sherman Act and the Section 4 of the Act of October 15, 1914, the amendatory thereof commonly known as the Clayton Act.","start":238.066,"stop":260.065,"duration":22},{"text":"That Section -- Section 4 of the Clayton Act is the statute which gives private persons who are injured, by violations of the antitrust

individuals.","start":273.901,"stop":279.773,"duration":5.87},{"text":"So that in paragraph 2, there is a rather straightforward statement that the complaint arises under the antitrust laws and under the section of the Clayton Act which gives a private right to damages.","start":279.773,"stop":294.357,"duration":14.58},{"text":"The complaint then alleged that described the parties, the plaintiff, Fox West Coast Theatres Corporation as a company organized in -- operates in the neighborhood of 150 motion picture theatres primarily on the West Coast.","start":294.357,"stop":309.264,"duration":14.91},{"text":"The defendant, Beacon operated the theatre -- opened the theatre, a drive-in theatre just outside of San Bernardino, California where Fox West Coast had for many years, operated a conventional theater as a theater with four walls and a ceiling.","start":309.264,"stop":324.614,"duration":15.35},{"text":"The complaint alleged, then, that there were eight major companies in the United States that produced films.","start":324.614,"stop":330.806,"duration":6.19},{"text":"And these were these -- and the complaint expressly stated that they constituted in the aggregate, this is at page 13 of the record, constant in the aggregate, the major distributors of motion pictures in the United States.","start":330.806,"stop":345.966,"duration":15.16},{"text":"Thereafter, the complaint alleged that there had been a prior antitrust case between the Government and these major suppliers of motion pictures.","start":345.966,"stop":353.988,"duration":8.02},{"text":"It was the case known as United States against Paramount which -- which started with the District Court, came to this Court, went back to the District Court openly affirmed.","start":353.988,"stop":363.746,"duration":9.76},{"text":"It was then alleged that there was a dispute between the parties.","start":363.746,"stop":368.227,"duration":4.48},{"text":"The complaint alleged that the plaintiff, Fox West Coast Theatres Corporation had for many years operated a theatre in San Bernardino on what was known as a first-run in clearance basis.","start":368.227,"stop":380.585,"duration":12.36},{"text":"That is, Fox West Coast had for many years licensed from this major distributors, the privilege or whatever you will call it, or at least there was a practice at that time to license to it a first-run.","start":380.585,"stop":394.375,"duration":13.79},{"text":"This Court has reviewed that problem often.","start":394.375,"stop":397.301,"duration":2.93},{"text":"First-run is the right to exhibit a picture exclusively first and that license clearance.","start":397.301,"stop":405.645,"duration":8.34},{"text":"The clearance is an agreement that you'll find in the cases and recognize in the industry as an agreement between a distributor of motion pictures and the exhibitor.","start":405.645,"stop":414.722,"duration":9.08},{"text":"The two parties agree that during the time that that exhibitor will exhibit the motion picture, that no other theatre will be permitted to exhibit that picture for a given period.","start":414.722,"stop":424.579,"duration":9.86},{"text":"It's in the nature, it's been called, analogized to the common law agreements on not to compete.","start":424.579,"stop":431.869,"duration":7.29},{"text":"That is analogized to those cases where a seller of a business selling goodwill agreed with the buyer that he would not compete for a given period of time.","start":431.869,"stop":441.228,"duration":9.36},{"text":"The Court will recall those -- those agreements were held finally to be unlawful if unreasonable.","start":441.228,"stop":450.241,"duration":9.01},{"text":"That is, if extended it too far, too greater area or extended into a length of time.","start":450.241,"stop":457.987,"duration":7.75},{"text":"They were analogized -- they have been analogized by this Court to those common law, unreasonable restraints of trade.","start":457.987,"stop":465.341,"duration":7.35},{"text":"And the -- the courts have held, in the motion picture industry, this Court among them, that such clearances were lawful if reasonable, unlawful if unreasonable.","start":465.341,"stop":475.103,"duration":9.76},{"text":"One aspect of unreasonability, the courts have held, is whether the clearance is granted between theatres that are not substantially competitive.","start":475.103,"stop":483.124,"duration":8.02},{"text":"Again, analogizing it to the common law rules.","start":483.124,"stop":487.244,"duration":4.12},{"text":"For if an agreement by a seller of a business as to goodwill, that if there was an agreement that he would not compete within an area broader than it was -- than was necessary, such agreements were not enforced because they were unnecessary and because they were basically restraints of competition.","start":487.244,"stop":506.859,"duration":19.61},{"text":"And since they were unnecessary, they would not be enforced by the courts.","start":506.859,"stop":511.348,"duration":4.49},{"text":"For that they would then be unreasonable.","start":511.348,"stop":515.207,"duration":3.86},{"text":"That rule of law, namely, that the clearances between theatres which are not substantially competitive is an-- is an unreasonable restraint of trade as a proposition of law which I understand neither party to contest here based upon this Court's decisions on the recognized decisions in other courts.","start":515.207,"stop":531.663,"duration":16.46},{"text":"And so the complaint alleged that for many years, Fox West Coast had operated the -- its theatre on this basis, an exclusive running clearance over theatres in the area.","start":531.663,"stop":541.977,"duration":10.31},{"text":"And it -- it was alleged that a controversy had arisen because of the -- of the opening -- because a theatre -- a new theatre was about to come into existence, namely, petitioner's theatre here, a drive-in theater located some 11 miles from downtown San Bernardino.","start":541.977,"stop":559.42,"duration":17.44},{"text":"The allegation was that the petitioner, Beacon Theatres made this contention.","start":559.42,"stop":566.276,"duration":6.86},{"text":"It contended that its drive-in theater was not and would not be substantially competitive with the downtown San Bernardino theatre.","start":566.276,"stop":575.099,"duration":8.82},{"text":"And that it contended, therefore, that if any distributor granted clearance, entered into a restrictive agreement that I've described, such a -- such an agreement would be unlawful under the antitrust laws.","start":575.099,"stop":588.415,"duration":13.32},{"text":"The complaint alleged that Fox, on the other hand, took a contrary position.","start":588.415,"stop":592.49,"duration":4.08},{"text":"That it contended those two theatres were not or were substantially competitive.","start":592.49,"stop":597.811,"duration":5.32},{"text":"And that, therefore, if either of them licensed, they first run and either of them obtained an agreement, a clearance agreement, that such an agreement would not be unlawful within the meaning of the law.","start":597.811,"stop":611.923,"duration":14.11},{"text":"The complaint there, then alleged that in -- restated this proposition in terms of rights, that is to say, it stated that -- that the plaintiff, Fox West Coast, contends that it had an equal right with Beacon to negotiate with each distributor independently for that prior running for a clearances between the two theatres.","start":611.923,"stop":636.736,"duration":24.81},{"text":"The -- this was the end of this -- after the completion of this paragraph, there then was alleged a paragraph XII, which became of some importance to the Court of Appeals which is what I mentioned.","start":636.736,"stop":650.437,"duration":13.7},{"text":"It was alleged in this -- in the next paragraph that petitioner, Beacon Theatres had threatened Fox West Coast and had told Fox that it -- that it had threatened the distributors.","start":650.437,"stop":665.446,"duration":15.01},{"text":"That if any distributor granted clearance between these two theatres, that the petitioner, Beacon, would file an antitrust case, a damage antitrust case against -- against any distributor who so did.","start":665.446,"stop":680.744,"duration":15.3},{"text":"While its not alleged, if you will recall, that in the prior paragraph, it is alleged, but not in this paragraph that the -- the difference of opinion was as to whether these theatres were competitive such a clearance will be unlawful.","start":680.744,"stop":691.323,"duration":10.58},{"text":"And so it was alleged that petitioner told Fox and told Fox that it had told the distributors, that if any such contract was entered into, it would file a damage suit under the antitrust laws.","start":691.323,"stop":703.994,"duration":12.67},{"text":"It was then alleged that these threats which it has alleged in the complaint were made to Fox and Fox had been informed that we had threatened the distributor.","start":703.994,"stop":713.771,"duration":9.78},{"text":"It was alleged that these threats exercise a coercion upon the distributors and resulted in the fact -- and resulted in depriving Fox from obtaining first-run and clearance in that area.","start":713.771,"stop":736.701,"duration":22.93},{"text":"A complaint, then alleged, to follow.","start":736.701,"stop":738.698,"duration":2},{"text":"The plaintiff was without any speedy or adequate remedy at law and will be irreparably harmed unless and I'm quoting, “Defendants and its officers, agents and employees are restrained and enjoined from instituting any action under the antitrust laws against the plaintiff and said distributors or any of them based upon the facts hereinabove alleged, during the pendency of this action and until such time as the Court shall determine whether or not the plaintiff and defendant have an equal and correlative right to license a prior run with clearance on behalf of their respective theatres.\"","start":738.698,"stop":770.744,"duration":32.05},{"text":"This is the body of the complaint in which the allegation was made that -- that unless the plaintiff -- the petitioner here, Beacon, is restrained from suing for damages under the antitrust laws, during the pendency of the case that there will be irreparable injury.","start":770.744,"stop":788.397,"duration":17.65},{"text":"Thereafter, the complaint set forth its prayer, the prayer is a fairly simple.","start":788.397,"stop":793.629,"duration":5.23},{"text":"The first one, asked the Court, the word is used to decree that a grant of clearance between a first-run theatre in San Bernardino between the Fox Theatre and the petitioner's theatre is not a violation of the antitrust laws and is not a violation of the decree in the Paramount case.","start":793.629,"stop":811.604,"duration":17.98},{"text":"Secondly, that it be decreed that the distributors are each them entitled to negotiate with the plaintiff and defendant and other operators of theaters in the competitive area equally for a prior run in the said area.","start":811.604,"stop":823.273,"duration":11.67},{"text":"Third, that the Court declares such, otherwise, for that pending file decision of the Court herein defendant Beacon and its theatres and its officers, agents and employees be restrained and enjoined again from commencing any action under the antitrust laws against plaintiff and the distributors hereinabove named arising out of the facts or controversies.","start":823.273,"stop":845.291,"duration":22.02},{"text":"This was the complaint.","start":845.291,"stop":847.294,"duration":2},{"text":"And the petitioner here, Beacon, when it made its demand for jury trial, in the trial court, as to the complaint took a very simple position and stated that -- that this was a complaint for declaratory relief, and a complaint for declaratory -- in a complaint for declaratory relief if the action is a substitute, for a suit at law, namely, a suit for damages under the antitrust laws that the petitioner is entitled to a -- that the defendant, either side was entitled to a jury trial and that this was on the face of the complaint an action for declaratory relief brought under the section of the antitrust laws relating to private damages and was not -- and that therefore, we were entitled to a -- to a jury trial.","start":847.294,"stop":891.061,"duration":43.77},{"text":"I might point out that it may not be an important point.","start":891.061,"stop":894.49,"duration":3.43},{"text":"The complaint I might say was not verified.","start":894.49,"stop":897.429,"duration":2.94},{"text":"This maybe of some significance because Rule 65 of the Federal Rules provide that if you want a preliminary restraining order, you've got to verify or you've got to put in an affidavit that during the entire pendency of these proceedings, all the time the matter was in the trial court, no application was made for injunction to restrain us from filing the antitrust case or any other type and no pleading, no papers were filed which will sustain such a -- such a request.","start":897.429,"stop":929.309,"duration":31.88},{"text":"The argument that we're entitled to a jury trial on this -- on the complaints standing -- standing alone was based not only upon the

West Coast that these problems of -- of restraints of trade by clearances have long been litigated in damage cases.","start":929.309,"stop":959.4,"duration":30.09},{"text":"That is as a fairly common
