because all the Montana-Dakota case held was that a complaint to a federal District Court that a rate charged by a regulated power company was unreasonable in the past, states no cause of action under the Federal Power Act, therefore, said the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court dismissed the complaint there being no diversity of citizenship between the parties.","start":53.935,"stop":88.702,"duration":34.77},{"text":"We submit that the Court's holding is far broader than that.","start":88.702,"stop":92.096,"duration":3.39},{"text":"It did not, we

reasonable rate is the right to the rate that's filed and effective with the Commission.","start":110.547,"stop":118.093,"duration":7.55},{"text":"No court can authorize any other rate, so no court can entertain a cause of action claiming a right to another rate.","start":118.093,"stop":126.36,"duration":8.27},{"text":"The Commission cannot authorize any other rate as a judicial matter respecting any period in the past.","start":126.36,"stop":134.86,"duration":8.5},{"text":"The Commission's authority is the legislative authority to fix rates for the future.","start":134.86,"stop":139.574,"duration":4.71},{"text":"Therefore, to hold that a cause of action existed, would be to say that the Court can entertain a cause of action in which it can decide no issue, then the Commission can entertain a complaint which the statute does not permit it to entertain namely, a complaint directed to the past rates, then the Commission can make a finding and then the Court can go ahead and render a judgment.","start":139.574,"stop":162.967,"duration":23.39},{"text":"In other words, it would be saying, we submit, to read the Montana case as the court below read it that the absence of power in the courts, coupled with the absence of power in the Commission, can somehow create power in both of them together.","start":162.967,"stop":179.031,"duration":16.06},{"text":"The Government's argument and shippers arguments generally, they go into the Court, they file their suit and the Court said, \"We

the past, but the shipper says, \"Oh, the Court has a cause of action pending.\"","start":197.102,"stop":208.685,"duration":11.58},{"text":"You therefore, as a collaborative instrument of justice, to use Justice Frankfurter's phrase in the Montana-Dakota case, can rend, make a finding.","start":208.685,"stop":217.209,"duration":8.52},{"text":"Well, as the majority held and as Justice Frankfurter speaking for the majority -- speaking for the minority agreed, where you have properly filed rates, no allegation of fraudulent filing, such as was present in Montana-Dakota and is not present here, the whole theory of rate regulation is premised on the proposition that errors in rates, unreasonable rates, will be corrected by prospective action by the Commission in the proscription of other rates for the future.","start":217.209,"stop":252.95,"duration":35.74},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals and respondent here, then go over and argue after all, there is a cause of action against a

common carrier by motor and they make two arguments.","start":275.455,"stop":282.194,"duration":6.74},{"text":"They say first, the declaration in the Act, that rates shall be just and reasonable, creates a right, creates a cause of action in a shipper.","start":282.194,"stop":297.55,"duration":15.36},{"text":"They admit that the Act provides no method for its enforcement, but they say we can improvise the method namely, suit by the shipper in a common-law court or in a -- in a common-law court followed by reference of the issue of reasonableness to the Commission.","start":297.55,"stop":319.949,"duration":22.4},{"text":"But we submit that Part I, regulating rail carriers and its specific provisions go far toward negativing any intention on the part

payment.","start":371.744,"stop":386.35,"duration":14.61},{"text":"Section 16 (2), provides that if the railroad fails to obey the Commission's order and make payment within the time specified in the

past.","start":404.986,"stop":418.753,"duration":13.77},{"text":"None of those provisions are found in Part II of the Act relating to motor carriers, not a single comparable provision.","start":418.753,"stop":428.083,"duration":9.33},{"text":"The only reference to any private redress for alleged violations of the Act in Part II, is the provision that suits for overcharges

of Oregon examined the legislative history of the Act at great length.","start":506.258,"stop":515.039,"duration":8.78},{"text":"And it pointed out that the original proposed act did provide that in the event of a violation of any of the provisions, any person injured or the Commission had a cause of action to enforce the Act.","start":515.039,"stop":536.2,"duration":21.16},{"text":"When the Act was enacted in the following year, that provision for private redress by individuals, persons injured was stricken and the Supreme Court of Oregon goes on to discuss the thinking of the Congress that they were taking under regulation, some 10,000 motor carriers in a completely chaotic state in 1935, when the whole problem, as the Government says in its brief, was to raise their rates from the --

Part II in 1935.","start":610.22,"stop":623.03,"duration":12.81},{"text":"If it had intended to give shippers by motor carriers, the same rights to damages that it had earlier given shippers by railroad, it's inconceivable that it would have conferred that cause of action by the simple declaration that unjust rates are unlawful, unjust and unreasonable rates are unlawful, when it had before it and at the very time it amend, it past the Motor Carrier Act, amended Part I, it had before it all of those elaborate provisions for damages against rail

from the Wabash case, forward that there is no state authority who'll regulate rates and the existence of a common-law right which requires state action for the implementation -- for the determination of the reasonable rate, in our view, would be to give the states power that they don't have under the Constitution, namely, the right to fix rates for interstate commerce.","start":835.488,"stop":870.072,"duration":34.58},{"text":"The Government's principal reliance, in its brief, is on this Court's recent decision in Western Pacific, the Western Pacific case

aerial bombs were not proper because the items transported were not bombs at all, they were napalm gel.","start":892.165,"stop":915.079,"duration":22.91},{"text":"The carrier brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amounts deducted by the General Accounting Office.","start":915.079,"stop":924.129,"duration":9.05},{"text":"The Government alleged that the rates were inapplicable and if in -- if applicable, unreasonable.","start":924.129,"stop":937.475,"duration":13.35},{"text":"The Court of Claims disallowed the defense on the ground that it could not determine whether the rates were reasonable and that the statute of limitations in Section 16 of the Act which provides for the filing of complaints for damages with the Commission, had run, was applicable to the Government and barred the Commission from considering the matter of the reasonableness of the rates.","start":937.475,"stop":967.907,"duration":30.43},{"text":"This Court reversed and remanded the case to the Court of Claims with directions to refer the issue to the Commission, but this Court's position was that in that case, there was no distinction in practicality between the allegation that the rates were inapplicable and the allegation that the rates were unreasonable.","start":967.907,"stop":997.288,"duration":29.38},{"text":"It took the view that the Government's position was that the rates were inapplicable and that one reason the Government maintain that they were inapplicable is that --- that because their use would produce an unreasonable result.","start":997.288,"stop":1011.711,"duration":14.42},{"text":"Now, we think that all that case holds is that where a tariff is ambiguous, you can resort to parole evidence namely, you can

rate.","start":1032.584,"stop":1056.475,"duration":23.89},{"text":"So there was no question whatever raised at any point, but that the Interstate Commerce Commission had fundamental jurisdiction bestowed on it by Part I to ascertain whether or not, that rate charged in that past period was reasonable and that the shipper had bestowed upon him by Part I, a right to recover damages if he had been charged an unreasonable rate, but to cite or to rely as the Government does on that case here, is to beg the question.","start":1056.475,"stop":1090.822,"duration":34.35},{"text":"It is to assume the answer to the very question.","start":1090.822,"stop":1093.88,"duration":3.06},{"text":"It is to assume that there is a justiciable legal right to some rate other than the filed and effective

rate regulatory authority of the Commission to the fixing of rates for the future on the assumption as Justice Frankfurter pointed out in the Montana case that if rates filed initially by the carrier
