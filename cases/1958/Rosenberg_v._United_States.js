trials.","start":51.622,"stop":57.307,"duration":5.69},{"text":"The first trial was reversed by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.","start":57.307,"stop":68.509,"duration":11.2},{"text":"The first trial was before the Jencks decision and before the so-called Jencks Act.","start":68.509,"stop":79.043,"duration":10.53},{"text":"The reversal by the Court of Appeals was based upon the fact that he was not given FBI material or statements reports, and was not provided with the grand jury minutes concerning two principal witnesses, one Meierdiercks and one Ms. Vossler, Ms. Vossler being the victim of the fraud.","start":79.043,"stop":106.193,"duration":27.15},{"text":"The Jencks Act had not been passed.","start":106.193,"stop":111.435,"duration":5.24},{"text":"Then, he was tried again before the same judge after the Jencks Act was passed.","start":111.435,"stop":119.593,"duration":8.16},{"text":"And during the trial, he was deprived of the material of which we now complain, FBI reports and some statements.","start":119.593,"stop":129.975,"duration":10.38},{"text":"And the Court of -- and the judge, I'll go into this much more fully later, claimed he was acting both under the Jencks Act and under the Jencks decision.","start":129.975,"stop":147.184,"duration":17.21},{"text":"The Court of Appeals confirmed the conviction and they acted under the Jencks Act and the Jencks decision, although they don't say so.","start":147.184,"stop":162.213,"duration":15.03},{"text":"The District Attorney or United States Attorney adheres strictly in his contentions to the Jencks Act.","start":162.213,"stop":170.983,"duration":8.77},{"text":"This Court granted certiorari on the grounds, first, whether the rule on the Jencks case was a rule of mere procedure or did it involve the defendant's constitutional rights.","start":170.983,"stop":189.062,"duration":18.08},{"text":"Then, again, whether or not a clear violation of the rule was harmless error, whether the conceded error of the trial court and the Court of Appeals found that there was -- there was error, error in withholding from counsel prior statements of a principal government witness could be excused by the Court of Appeals because it found that the defense was not hampered in cross-examination of those witnesses concerning material that's in a sealed envelope that's never been seen by the petitioner.","start":189.062,"stop":222.647,"duration":33.58},{"text":"And, another part of the certiorari is that it is proper for a Court of Appeals to determine what use defense counsel might have made of the statements erroneously withheld.","start":222.647,"stop":235.029,"duration":12.38},{"text":"The -- the case, when it came up for trial again and prior thereto, the defendant made two motions.","start":235.029,"stop":252.709,"duration":17.68},{"text":"The third one, which is not too important for a continuance, the two motions were that he be allowed to inspect before trial the statements of Meierdiercks, who was the principal witness and Vossler, who was also a principal witness and who the judge knew, all the judges knew, had to be material witnesses or the Government had no case.","start":252.709,"stop":283.259,"duration":30.55},{"text":"It was first presented to the assignment judge whose ruling was that, because of the Jencks Act, he could not allow the motions at that time.","start":283.259,"stop":298.897,"duration":15.64},{"text":"The preposition being stated to him that it would delay the trial and interrupt the trial, and so forth, and a -- the judge said no.","start":298.897,"stop":310.313,"duration":11.42},{"text":"He was bound to wait until the witness testified, although he knew and everybody else knew that those witnesses were bound to testify.","start":310.313,"stop":320.033,"duration":9.72},{"text":"However, he put a loophole in his ruling to this extent.","start":320.033,"stop":325,"duration":4.97},{"text":"He said “you may renew this request again to the trial judge.”","start":325,"stop":329.527,"duration":4.53},{"text":"And, the request was renewed to the trial judge who, as I say, was the same judge who tried the case first, and his remarks in the record show that he knows just what the Government needs because he said the Government cannot prove this case, unless Mr. Meierdiercks testifies.","start":329.527,"stop":349.425,"duration":19.9},{"text":"They might leave out Ms. Vossler but I don't see how they could do it.","start":349.425,"stop":354.133,"duration":4.71},{"text":"However, he denied the motion again not as a matter of discretion, as I read the record, but as a matter that he was bound to wait until the witness testified.","start":354.133,"stop":370.892,"duration":16.76},{"text":"Now, at the trial, Mr. Meierdiercks was not only the main witness, but the only witness who implicates the defendant.","start":370.892,"stop":383.162,"duration":12.27},{"text":"And, Mr. Meierdiercks, who himself was a confessed criminal in not only this particular activity but running many, many years with a long criminal career, had made statements to the FBI.","start":383.162,"stop":405.059,"duration":21.9},{"text":"The first statement that he made was that he was in no way implicated in any wrong doing.","start":405.059,"stop":415.987,"duration":10.93},{"text":"He then made another statement in which he again denied that he had done anything wrong or that he knew the petitioner Rosenberg.","start":415.987,"stop":428.234,"duration":12.25},{"text":"Now, there were two interviews with Mr. Meierdiercks before he made a written statement.","start":428.234,"stop":439.395,"duration":11.16},{"text":"Those two appear at the bottom of page 46 and they were not given to the defendant.","start":439.395,"stop":446.66,"duration":7.27},{"text":"I might say, at this point, that never did the Government asked the judge to edit any reports or material in its possession, although I believe that the Government's brief says that the judge could edit what had to be submitted to the defendant.","start":446.66,"stop":468.021,"duration":21.36},{"text":"I don't believe that Mr. Bechtle's objections were based upon anything except the fact that 3500 did not permit these papers to be given to the because they were not signed by Mr. Meierdiercks, they were not approved by him, they were not adopted by him, nor were they verbatim.","start":468.021,"stop":491.768,"duration":23.75},{"text":"He rested on 3500.","start":491.768,"stop":494.705,"duration":2.94},{"text":"Now, these two reports to the FBI agents are interviews with Mr. Meierdiercks but they were not given to the defendant.","start":494.705,"stop":506.127,"duration":11.42},{"text":"I believe they are in the sealed envelope.","start":506.127,"stop":509.148,"duration":3.02},{"text":"This -- most of the material that I can tell you about appears in the Court of Appeals opinion at page 94.","start":509.148,"stop":526.106,"duration":16.96},{"text":"Judge Hasty has, there, revealed the contents of these papers.","start":526.106,"stop":534.156,"duration":8.05},{"text":"Now, what the judge did, he examined them himself.","start":534.156,"stop":540.269,"duration":6.11},{"text":"He took charge and he examined them in camera.","start":540.269,"stop":546.982,"duration":6.71},{"text":"He never allowed the defendant to know any of the contents and, in connection with Exhibits 5 and 6, he gave part of those exhibits, pages 2 and 4, I believe, of Exhibit 6 and certain parts of Exhibit 5.","start":546.982,"stop":563.921,"duration":16.94},{"text":"That's C5 and C6, his own exhibit, the Court's exhibit, but he wouldn't show the rest and the rest, I believe, is also contained in the sealed envelope.","start":563.921,"stop":576.152,"duration":12.23},{"text":"There are also two office memoranda of the FBI concerning the progress and procedure of a then-pending prosecution against Meierdiercks.","start":576.152,"stop":585.459,"duration":9.31},{"text":"That's also page 95 of the record.","start":585.459,"stop":593.862,"duration":8.4},{"text":"There's another paper which contains the detailed physical description and summary and personal history of Meierdiercks.","start":593.862,"stop":600.721,"duration":6.86},{"text":"Still, another is a record of an unsuccessful search for certain names on hotel registers on or about the time of the crime.","start":600.721,"stop":610.287,"duration":9.57},{"text":"The -- then, he says “these and other miscellaneous items from the prosecution's files were obviously not germane to the request of the defendant.”","start":610.287,"stop":619.126,"duration":8.84},{"text":"Why the Prosecution produced them is not clear.","start":619.126,"stop":622.666,"duration":3.54},{"text":"Their surrender could not have been responsive to the defense's request or to any proper request for whatever records the Government had, in verbatim text or otherwise, of prior statements of certain witnesses.","start":622.666,"stop":634.963,"duration":12.3},{"text":"These were given to the judge.","start":634.963,"stop":638.678,"duration":3.72},{"text":"And then, he says there -- in addition, there was a minute or office notation, stating of fact that, on the first questioning, Meierdiercks had denied any involvement and any alleged wrong doing.","start":638.678,"stop":650.578,"duration":11.9},{"text":"Then, there was a typewritten copy of a detailed statement of Meierdiercks about the crime.","start":650.578,"stop":656.385,"duration":5.81},{"text":"The Court of Appeals says there that the handwritten copy was the original.","start":656.385,"stop":661.71,"duration":5.33},{"text":"How do we know that it was the original?","start":661.71,"stop":664.924,"duration":3.21},{"text":"It is a -- it is Exhibit

12-page handwritten statement which Meierdiercks testified -- it's C2, Court Exhibit 2.","start":674.296,"stop":686.932,"duration":12.64},{"text":"Meierdiercks testified that, upon questioning by the FBI agent, the FBI agent wrote a lot of things and he was hesitant about it.","start":686.932,"stop":700.672,"duration":13.74},{"text":"He wasn't cooperative, and then, he became cooperative, and the statement was finally presented to him and he signed it.","start":700.672,"stop":708.24,"duration":7.57},{"text":"And, I saw it this morning in the Clerk's Office and is witnessed by two special

we -- there is one sentence of it that I think summarizes what that whole history said, and that is that the object of the statute was simple to substitute judgment for automatic application of rules, to preserve review as a check upon arbitrary action and essential unfairness in trial but, at the same time, to make the process perform that function without giving men, fairly convicted, the multiplicity of loopholes which any highly rigid and minutely detailed scheme of errors, especially in relation to procedure, will engender and reflect in a printed record.","start":2703.421,"stop":2756.07,"duration":52.65},{"text":"Now, this, as the Court went on to the say in Kotteakos, is easier to say than to

judgment.","start":2762.459,"stop":2793.617,"duration":31.16},{"text":"And, in this case, as it happens, we don't even have to speculate about what the defense would have
