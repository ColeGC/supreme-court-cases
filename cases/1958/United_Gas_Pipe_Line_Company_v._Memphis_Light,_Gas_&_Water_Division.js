first.”","start":649.27,"stop":658.585,"duration":9.32},{"text":"Now, if the two utility companies can get together on a rate increase, if the pipeline can convince its costumer that it's entitled to

rate is too high, then you agree upon a lower rate.","start":677.328,"stop":687.529,"duration":10.2},{"text":"And the lower rate goes into effect under Section 4 in the quicker

been talking about all the other rates up till now.","start":719.735,"stop":735.398,"duration":15.66},{"text":"Now, let's see what sense that makes in terms of the Congressional intent.","start":735.398,"stop":742.808,"duration":7.41},{"text":"Here you have a situation where you have two public utilities dealing with each other, the pipeline and the distributor.","start":742.808,"stop":750.28,"duration":7.47},{"text":"Now, Congress says that if these two public utilities can get together and agree upon a rate which they as between themselves

reasonable?","start":750.28,"stop":773.466,"duration":23.19},{"text":"And therefore, isn't it appropriate to allow the new rate to go into effect under barn so it's in effect while the Commission

should.","start":773.466,"stop":795.936,"duration":22.47},{"text":"On the other hand, suppose the two utility companies, the parties directly involved in the rate have not been able to get together on what they consider is a reasonable rate then isn't it reasonable that the new rates sought -- whether the higher rates sought by the pipeline or the lower rate sought by the costumer, the distributor, isn't it reasonable that the new rate should have to prove itself as it were in the course of the Commission proceedings before the Commission order makes it effective?","start":795.936,"stop":832.471,"duration":36.53},{"text":"The whole Act begins to take form and shape and all we're asking, I repeat once more, is an even break for the distributor and the pipeline.","start":832.471,"stop":846.682,"duration":14.21},{"text":"The distributor under this theory has the same rights to a decrease as -- as the pipeline does to an increase and this gives him

Court said.","start":871.538,"stop":899.149,"duration":27.61},{"text":"The Court was saying in Section, it was discussing in Section 4, the fact that the Natural Gas Act did not change the contractual powers of Natural Gas Companies, did not interfere with or changed the rate making or rate changing powers of Natural Gas Companies and it followed that up by this sentence which is found in page 343 of the opinion.","start":899.149,"stop":924.63,"duration":25.48},{"text":"The obvious implication is that except as specifically limited by the Act, the rate making powers of Natural Gas Companies would be no different from those they would possess in the absence of the Act, it's in the (Inaudible), to establish ex parte and change at will rates offered to prospective customers or to fix by contract and change only by mutual agreement the rate agreed upon with a particular customer.","start":924.63,"stop":966.357,"duration":41.73},{"text":"Now, which one of those alternatives do we fall under in this Court?","start":966.357,"stop":972.893,"duration":6.54},{"text":"May it please the Court there is not a single prospective customer in the picture in this case.","start":972.893,"stop":980.365,"duration":7.47},{"text":"Every single customer is a long-term contract customer of United.","start":980.365,"stop":987.253,"duration":6.89},{"text":"Therefore,

these particular customers.","start":987.253,"stop":1012.974,"duration":25.72},{"text":"The Court also said, oh, and -- and let me pause there to say that it seemed to appear from the argument of opposing counsel that what we were trying to do was to demolish the Commission's regulations.","start":1012.974,"stop":1032.233,"duration":19.26},{"text":"Now, I grant that I said what Mr. Carson

Rankin.","start":1047.671,"stop":1056.661,"duration":8.99},{"text":"Now, we do have quarrel with the message there set forth in the briefs but if you will recall, General Rankin said that the only purpose of the regulations was to take these sheets of contracts and he showed how thick it was, a lot of different complicated contracts which United had with all its customers and reduced it down to this much contract to put all of the contractual arrangements between the parties into a uniform format prescribed by the Commission and that was the only purpose of the regulation.","start":1056.661,"stop":1097.3,"duration":40.64},{"text":"And that was the purpose that the Commission said at the time that promulgated the regulations as their only purpose and we quote

in promulgating Order Number 144, which of course promulgated these regulations, was precisely as it stated in its explanatory opinion therewith that the proposed amendment of the general rules and

of Natural Gas in Interstate Commerce.","start":1115.817,"stop":1145.198,"duration":29.38},{"text":"It was solely a matter of form, and as a matter of form, we have no quarrel with it at

this case is this.","start":1180.828,"stop":1188.619,"duration":7.79},{"text":"In the Mobile case, the Commission came to the Court saying United has a right to file this unilateral change in its contract because the Natural Gas Act, Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act by providing a rate changing procedure confers upon at that right.","start":1188.619,"stop":1209.36,"duration":20.74},{"text":"That was the Commission's argument in Mobile.","start":1209.36,"stop":1211.781,"duration":2.42},{"text":"And this Court said, \"No,

only one way.","start":1342.186,"stop":1344.646,"duration":2.46},{"text":"United has got to find somewhere, somehow an agreement on the part of its co-contractor to pay the substitute
