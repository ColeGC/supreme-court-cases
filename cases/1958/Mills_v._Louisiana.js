collaboration between state and federal authorities would vitiate such testimony.","start":4143.611,"stop":4171.97,"duration":28.36},{"text":"Now the question we're confronted with it seems to me is this, there are two phases to it; one assuming that there was such collaboration and I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter described it as illicit acquisition, I think the collaboration or cooperation would

prosecution.","start":4219.117,"stop":4224.699,"duration":5.58},{"text":"The question before the Court today is, if this testimony, which the defendants Mills and so on declined to give under the

that, that testimony possibly might not be used in a subsequent federal prosecution.","start":4224.699,"stop":4253.629,"duration":28.93},{"text":"Now reviewing the facts on the basis of that

these.","start":4253.629,"stop":4280.286,"duration":26.66},{"text":"One there were conferences admitted between the Federal District Attorney and the State District Attorney with reference not to

tax assessments by the federal revenue department.","start":4304.454,"stop":4326.678,"duration":22.22},{"text":"Now I'll go in sort of reverse order, take the waiver that was pointed out by

there is not that kind of cooperation, somebody is not doing his duty.","start":4423.433,"stop":4427.969,"duration":4.54},{"text":"Now the federal government is naturally interested in income tax problems, I mean that's a concern with all of us.","start":4427.969,"stop":4434.105,"duration":6.14},{"text":"In this particular type of case the men or the people that they were after were the

federal government had in the thing, so that the extent of the cooperation and collaboration in-between the district attorney and the federal district attorney could not amount to illicit acquisition

testimony elicited under state immunity statute.","start":4476.195,"stop":4508.559,"duration":32.36},{"text":"Now the third thing the indictment of the policeman which had taken place prior to this, I
