excluded or pursuant to an application for discharge made by him on the ground that he is an alien.","start":167.586,"stop":196.241,"duration":28.66},{"text":"Now, that seemed to be the thinking of

lawful.","start":289.749,"stop":304.075,"duration":14.33},{"text":"And when you find the House reacting to the suggestion of an Attorney General in this particular nature while lawful admission as an immigrant or a non-immigrant is held to be a prerequisite to naturalization, the Committee is of the opinion that the technicalities involved in connection with the continuance of such status at the time of entering the Armed Forces would place an unwarranted burden on servicemen and practically nullify the purpose of the legislation.","start":304.075,"stop":337.094,"duration":33.02},{"text":"And
