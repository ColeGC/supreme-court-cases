argument.","start":432.642,"stop":435.664,"duration":3.02},{"text":"The first, that the term “immoral” as defined by the legislature is so vague as to permit the suppression of speech which is protected by the constitution and, for that reason, it offends against the Due Process Clause.","start":435.664,"stop":454.662,"duration":19},{"text":"And, the second prong for that point or argument

speech.","start":454.662,"stop":475.04,"duration":20.38},{"text":"Now, if that relief is also denied, we seek an order reversing the ban of this particular film on the ground that it is not of a type

film.","start":475.04,"stop":510.675,"duration":35.63},{"text":"Now, with respect to the first point, that the entire licensing law is

picture.","start":531.175,"stop":553.681,"duration":22.51}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I -- I -- my only thought was that you might -- you might argue your broad

question.","start":574.354,"stop":583.074,"duration":8.72},{"text":"Now, the brief submitted by the Regents says, in effect, in -- in discussing this question that -- well, there they go again raising that same old First Amendment issue, which has been presented before and I don't think we need to apologize for resorting to our fundamental rights and the sources of those rights, when the fundamental right of free speech has been denied.","start":583.074,"stop":615.274,"duration":32.2},{"text":"The question was deliberately left open in the case of Burstyn against Wilson.","start":615.274,"stop":623.892,"duration":8.62},{"text":"In that case, the Court characterized the very law that's under consideration here as unbridled censorship, as a form of prior restraint to be especially condemned, and stated that the State of New York is under a heavy burden to demonstrate the necessity for allowing any such censorship.","start":623.892,"stop":662.592,"duration":38.7},{"text":"The Regents have interpreted that decision to mean that this Court has countenanced and sustained the validity of prior censorship laws.","start":662.592,"stop":682.658,"duration":20.07},{"text":"The opinion of Judge Conway in the court below seems to have read that the -- I mean, in the opinion, Judge Conway seems to have read the Court's opinion in the Burstyn case in precisely the same way.","start":682.658,"stop":699.152,"duration":16.49},{"text":"I submit, Your Honor, that there is no language in the opinion that would justify that conclusion.","start":699.152,"stop":705.857,"duration":6.7},{"text":"And, in fact, every case involving moving -- moving picture licensing laws that has come before the Court since that time, and there have been five, in every case, the Court has reversed the determination suppressing the particular film.","start":705.857,"stop":735.145,"duration":29.29},{"text":"The reason that we find the law -- the licensing law particularly offensive is it one must, in order to exercise his right of communication, and this Court has recognized the right to show a film or has recognized films as a mean of communication, is that one must come hand in hand in order to secure permission to exercise his right of expression and the public may not be allowed to see a picture or to receive a communication until it has been -- it has been certified as fit for approval by this censorship body.","start":735.145,"stop":782.751,"duration":47.61},{"text":"Under the law of New York, as it is -- now exists, there is very little right of review of a decision of the Administrative Board in the respect that its determination of the facts cannot be reversed unless its determination is clearly unreasonable.","start":782.751,"stop":815.337,"duration":32.59},{"text":"The burden is placed on whoever owns the rights to the picture to show that this determination of the -- of the Regents or the Administrative Board was unreasonable, and it's an impossible burden to sustain.","start":815.337,"stop":835.857,"duration":20.52},{"text":"And, I believe, in the history of the State of New York, it has been sustained only once and the question of fact.","start":835.857,"stop":842.529,"duration":6.67},{"text":"This law has been, in effect, I believe, since about 1911 in various forms.","start":842.529,"stop":846.639,"duration":4.11},{"text":"I may not be sure that -- I may not be correct about the date, but it has been in effect for a very long time and only once was there a reversal on the facts.","start":846.639,"stop":855.5,"duration":8.86},{"text":"There had been several reversals based on the finding that the law was, in part, unconstitutional.","start":855.5,"stop":863.688,"duration":8.19},{"text":"But, now, with respect to this burden that is placed on the one who would show his picture, I think it's best illustrated by this particular case.","start":863.688,"stop":875.244,"duration":11.56},{"text":"We have here a finding that the film is immoral and, according to the Court, the determination of whether or not it's immoral must be made in accordance with the mores and standards of the community.","start":875.244,"stop":895.902,"duration":20.66},{"text":"The distributor of the picture must, to convince the Court that the determination of the Regents of the Censorship Board was improper and unreasonable, show that the community standings are different that the -- that the picture is not really immoral in accordance with the community standards.","start":895.902,"stop":923.869,"duration":27.97},{"text":"In short, he must prove the community standards or reaction to a picture which he cannot show to the public or to the community.","start":923.869,"stop":934.46,"duration":10.59},{"text":"Even if he were permitted to show the picture to the community, how is one to prove what the community standards
