bargaining representative of the company's employees.","start":64.009,"stop":73.479,"duration":9.47},{"text":"Thereafter, between August of that year and November of the following year, representatives of the union and of the company engaged in a series of 20 almost -- about 20 conferences for the purposes of arriving a collective bargaining agreement but they were unable to do so.","start":73.479,"stop":91.246,"duration":17.77},{"text":"Among the principle obstacles that prevented agreement were the company's insistence upon a contract which would give it the unilateral

company.","start":146.903,"stop":155.185,"duration":8.28},{"text":"The atmosphere of these negotiations was not enhanced when, in April of 1954, the company made certain individual wage adjustments

effect.","start":155.185,"stop":176.97,"duration":21.78},{"text":"In May of 1954, the union filed a charge with the Board and this charge alleged that the company had engaged and was engaging in

negotiate.","start":231.383,"stop":238.305,"duration":6.92},{"text":"And then October of 1954, the company unilaterally without prior notice or consultation with the union put into effect a -- a general wage increase for all of the employers and after having done so, notified the union.","start":238.305,"stop":253.708,"duration":15.4},{"text":"In fact, the union discovered it quite

Director.","start":301.269,"stop":321.144,"duration":19.88},{"text":"And -- and shortly thereafter, the Regional Director issued a complaint against the

record, the page upon top, 119, the Board said, \"We have no difficulty in determining the respondent's bad faith throughout these protracted negotiations particularly in view of the respondent's unilateral effectuation of a general wage increase early in October 1954 while the negotiations were still in progress but without consultation with or even notice to the union,\" and then skipping over to page 128 in order to fill out this, at -- on page 126 rather at the bottom of that page, the Board in conclusionary term said, \"We find rather that the giving of this general increase while

union.”","start":462.336,"stop":515.058,"duration":52.72},{"text":"It clearly shows that after November 21st, 1953, the cutoff date determined by the General Counsel pursuant provisions of Section 10 (b), respondent was merely going through the motions of collective bargaining without a genuine intention of trying to negotiate an agreement over the union.","start":515.058,"stop":532.045,"duration":16.99},{"text":"Now, the court below read the Board's decision to mean and parenthetically, I may say that we think it was an error, the court below read the Board's decision to mean that a part from the unilateral wage increase of October 1954, the record of the negotiations between the company and the union would not support, would not support a finding that the company had bargained in bad faith during these negotiations.","start":532.045,"stop":557.18,"duration":25.13},{"text":"Accordingly, accordingly, the critical question for the court below became whether the Board's complaint could take cognizance of the unilateral wage increase which occurred after the filing of the union's charge.","start":557.18,"stop":572.806,"duration":15.63},{"text":"The answer which the court below gave is this, “The principal opinion of the court below said that the Board's complaint must be

charge.”","start":572.806,"stop":592.051,"duration":19.25},{"text":"The concurring opinion by Judge Hutcheson took the position that the unilateral wage increase of October was a completely new and

dissented on both counts.","start":592.051,"stop":614.099,"duration":22.05},{"text":"It is our position that the Board may take cognizance, the Board may take cognizance of the events which occur after the filing of the charge which are either related to the subject matter of the -- which are either grow out of or are related to the subject matter of the charge pending the Board's investigation of the charge and secondly that the unilateral wage increase which took place here after the filing of charge is related to the subject matter of the charge which was filed in -- in May of 1954.","start":614.099,"stop":650.918,"duration":36.82},{"text":"Now, let me address myself first to the second, what I regard as the subsidiary question, namely, whether the unilateral wage increase, which occurred after the filing of the charge, was related to the subject matter of the union's charge.","start":650.918,"stop":667.886,"duration":16.97},{"text":"The charge, in effect, called upon the Board to investigate the bargaining relationship between the company and the union.","start":667.886,"stop":677.109,"duration":9.22},{"text":"This unilateral wage increase took place in the course of that bargaining relationship.","start":677.109,"stop":682.018,"duration":4.91},{"text":"Indeed, it went to the very heart of that relationship for as this Court has set such action of that kind on the part of an employer constitutes the very antithesis of collective bargaining and a negation, and a negation of the union's representative status.","start":682.018,"stop":698.427,"duration":16.41},{"text":"More than that, the unilateral wage increase was a further reflection, a further manifestation and further continuation, if you will, of the company's persistent attitude throughout the negotiations on the base which lead to the charge of the company's persistent attitude of maintaining a completely freehand with respect, with respect to the terms and the conditions of employment.","start":698.427,"stop":722.973,"duration":24.55},{"text":"We think that in every meaningful, in any meaningful sense, it must be said that the unilateral wage increase of October is -- directly bears upon the bargaining relationship which the Board was called upon to investigate and is directly related to us.","start":722.973,"stop":738.493,"duration":15.52},{"text":"The argument is made, however, that since the Board did not find that there was an unfair labor practice on the basis of the pre-charge conduct, that the post-charge unilateral wage increase is not related, is not related to the pre-charge conduct.","start":738.493,"stop":756.681,"duration":18.19},{"text":"Apart from the fact that this argument misreads initially, it misreads initially the Board's -- the Board's decision in this case because, as I said a moment ago and this is the one with the reasons why I read the Board's decision, the Board found that the company, throughout the course of these negotiations, had manifested at bad faith.","start":756.681,"stop":774.84,"duration":18.16},{"text":"The argument is made that they say on this reading of the Board's -- on this reading of the Board's decision that there was no unfair labor practice on -- during -- committed during the time preceding the charge.","start":774.84,"stop":786.227,"duration":11.39},{"text":"The argument is made that the post-charge unilateral wage increase is not related to any unfair labor practice which is a subject of the -- of the charge.","start":786.227,"stop":795.402,"duration":9.18},{"text":"As I say, this does not only misreads the Board's decision but it doesn't hold any -- doesn't -- the argument doesn't have any merit because the critical factor is whether, for our purposes of relationship, for determining relationship in this context, the critical factors whether the post-charge events or matters have immaterial and logical connection with the subject matter, with the subject matter of the charge.","start":795.402,"stop":819.535,"duration":24.13},{"text":"Now, that connection exist or does not exist, it seems to us, without regard to what the Board's ultimate conclusions may be as to the legality or illegality of the conduct in question.","start":819.535,"stop":832.214,"duration":12.68},{"text":"Now, let me turn now to what we believe is the principle question, the more important question in this case, namely, whether the Board may take cognizance of events or matters which occur after the filing of a charge but which are grow out of, as we or are -- as in this case, or are related to the subject matter of the charge.","start":832.214,"stop":857.58,"duration":25.37},{"text":"The principal opinion below, as I have indicated, took the positions that the complaint of the Board must be confined, must be confined to the subject -- to the -- the allegations of the charge and that the Board may -- may not look or take cognizance of the events which occur after the filing of the charge.","start":857.58,"stop":876.994,"duration":19.41},{"text":"We believe that this view rest upon a mistaken conception of what a charge is, what a complaint is, and what the Board's role is in the investigation on the prosecution of charges.","start":876.994,"stop":891.497,"duration":14.5},{"text":"The statute provides, as I briefly alluded to a moment ago, the statute provides that when -- whenever a charge is filed alleging that a person is engaging or has engaged in unfair labor practices, the Board is empowered to issue a complaint stating the charges in that respect.","start":891.497,"stop":911.025,"duration":19.53},{"text":"The statute also provides that the Board shall not issue a complaint with respect to unfair labor practice that occur -- that have occurred more than six months prior to the filing of the charge.","start":911.025,"stop":923.522,"duration":12.5},{"text":"Now, a charge under the statute may be filed by anyone.","start":923.522,"stop":927.558,"duration":4.04},{"text":"It is all compiled by people who, in the nature of things, have limited perception, understanding of the conducts to which they are complaining, its ramifications and its legal significance.","start":927.558,"stop":939.295,"duration":11.74},{"text":"A charge is not a pleading.","start":939.295,"stop":941.176,"duration":1.88},{"text":"All that the charge does is merely set the Board's machinery in the motion.","start":941.176,"stop":946.546,"duration":5.37},{"text":"Now, once the -- the charge has been filed and the Board's machinery has been set in motion, then the -- the burden, the responsibility for investigating the charge rest with the Board.","start":946.546,"stop":958.376,"duration":11.83},{"text":"And if the Board determines on the basis of its investigation that a complaint should issue, like the complaint issues and the statute also expressly provides that the Board may amend that complaint at anytime prior to the issuance of a final order.","start":958.376,"stop":974.377,"duration":16},{"text":"The statutory scheme, it seems to us, suggest that it is the Board's obligation to frame the issues between itself and the party charged and the complaint serves this purpose.","start":974.377,"stop":986.508,"duration":12.13},{"text":"It has often been said that the case between the Board and the particular respondent starts not with the charge really but actually -- but rather with the complaint.","start":986.508,"stop":995.412,"duration":8.9},{"text":"And this, we think, is in keeping with the underlying purposes of the statute, namely, that the Board's function is to vindicate public rights and not private rights.","start":995.412,"stop":1004.993,"duration":9.58},{"text":"Now, if the court below is right that the Board must stick closely, must stick closely to the allegations of the charge and be oblivious, and be oblivious to related conduct whether it occurs before the filing of the charge or after, that, it seems to us, that the result is, the result is that the vindication of the public rights which the statute has in mind rest largely, upon the necessarily and often limited perception, judgement and certainly, inadequate investigation of a private party rather upon the informed judgement of the Board after a full investigation.","start":1004.993,"stop":1042.276,"duration":37.28},{"text":"More than that, I think that such an artificial restriction upon the Board's power would often hamper the Board in addressing itself in a comprehensive and meaningful manner of fashion to the picture which its investigation has disclosed.","start":1042.276,"stop":1057.245,"duration":14.97},{"text":"And I think the instant case here illustrates that point.","start":1057.245,"stop":1061.59,"duration":4.35},{"text":"Here, the charge, in effect, called upon the Board to investigate the bargaining relationship between the company -- company and the union.","start":1061.59,"stop":1070.695,"duration":9.11},{"text":"That relationship was a continuing one.","start":1070.695,"stop":1073.054,"duration":2.36},{"text":"It did not end with a filing of the charge but continued thereafter.","start":1073.054,"stop":1077.176,"duration":4.12},{"text":"And yet, the court below would say to the Board, that the Board must stop in its investigation of a
