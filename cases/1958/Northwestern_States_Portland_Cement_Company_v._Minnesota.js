taxable by Minnesota.","start":197.252,"stop":204.738,"duration":7.49},{"text":"Upon Northwestern's refusal to file returns, the Commissioner of Taxation for the State of Minnesota prepared the

factor formula equally weighted, that is the ratio of the taxpayer's shipments into Minnesota, to its shipment replace or sales, the ratio of the taxpayer's property in Minnesota to its property everywhere, and the ratio of its wages paid in Minnesota to its wages everywhere.","start":236.651,"stop":262.222,"duration":25.57},{"text":"Now the income taxes, interest and penalties which were

Supreme Court of Minnesota in a five to two divided opinion upheld the action of the trial court.","start":277.783,"stop":286.092,"duration":8.31},{"text":"Now the Minnesota income tax is what is sometime known as a second structured tax, there is two sections to it.","start":286.092,"stop":293.452,"duration":7.36},{"text":"The first section provides that an excise tax shall be laid up on the

exactly the same manner.","start":359.015,"stop":363.547,"duration":4.53},{"text":"The Minnesota Supreme Court held that the tax was not an excise tax, it was not a franchise tax, it was a not a

Maun","textObjs":[{"text":"It's in six states, I would say that again you get into Your Honor of whether or not you have the same deduction and that sort of thing, based on what the Minnesota law is, it wouldn't be true, and now Wisconsin we get into there and they don't permit a federal deduction, so we get into different concepts of what constitutes income, but based on the Minnesota formula Iowa does not.","start":457.411,"stop":480.558,"duration":23.15},{"text":"Now first of all, as we probably know that due process may have a threefold impact on taxes of this nature.","start":480.558,"stop":488.992,"duration":8.43},{"text":"First we get into the question of what we might call procedural due process of whether there can be in personam jurisdiction over this taxpayer.","start":488.992,"stop":500.353,"duration":11.36},{"text":"Now -- and then we get into the question of legislative jurisdiction over the subject matter of the tax and thirdly assuming those two aspects ever are satisfied, the question of whether there is due process in the apportionment factor.","start":500.353,"stop":516.042,"duration":15.69},{"text":"Now we believe that in this case that Minnesota does have jurisdiction in personam over this taxpayer and that's not the issue before this Court, I think based on the International Shoe Company case against Washington where it provided that they needed only such notice as will satisfy the requirements of substantial justice, bearing fair play that there is jurisdiction as far as procedural jurisdiction over this taxpayer.","start":516.042,"stop":545.034,"duration":28.99},{"text":"We contend, however, if Minnesota does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter, so as to able it to impose a tax upon the income of this company, it would seem that if Minnesota does have jurisdiction over the subject matter, then probably we would never reach the question of whether this tax violates the Commerce Clause.","start":545.034,"stop":568.343,"duration":23.31},{"text":"Although this Court has observed in some of it's prior decisions that the conceptions of due process in Commerce Clause is they related to validity of tax statutes, sometimes overlap, they are still not identical and we should sharply distinguish them.","start":568.343,"stop":583.914,"duration":15.57},{"text":"It would certainly appear that Minnesota has any jurisdiction at all to tax here then it must be, because it can subject interstate commerce itself to income tax because that is the only subject matter within the boundaries of the State of Minnesota.","start":583.914,"stop":599.665,"duration":15.75},{"text":"Here the trial court itself followed that the only activities of this company carried on within the State of Minnesota were an integral part of interstate commerce and all of its revenues were produced from interstate commerce.","start":599.665,"stop":616.381,"duration":16.72},{"text":"Now time and time again, this Court has said that the solicitation of orders, together with such acts as maybe in furtherance thereof does not provide the local incidence of operation, which ables a state to tax a foreign corporation, but should in all other respects stays at home.","start":616.381,"stop":635.815,"duration":19.43},{"text":"The reason for this of course is that solicitation, is an essential ingredient of interstate commerce itself, and this fundamental concept of course was first pronounced by this Court in early case of Robbins against Shelby County Taxing District.","start":635.815,"stop":652.104,"duration":16.29},{"text":"In more recent cases this question of due process of a state with relation to other kinds of taxes has risen many times.","start":652.104,"stop":660.602,"duration":8.5},{"text":"In Miller Bros., the Court will remember against the State of Maryland, this Court stuck down the Maryland excise tax on the use, storage of consumptions of articles of commerce insofar as Maryland attempted to impose the responsibility of perfection.","start":660.602,"stop":677.238,"duration":16.64},{"text":"It was in – and there the solicitation part took (Inaudible) of radio and newspaper advertising and this Court there pointed out that although its decisions were not always clear, and to the reason for the invalidity of these taxes, the principle remained that due process always required some definite link, some minimum connection between the state, the person, the property and the business, which it sought to impose a tax upon.","start":677.238,"stop":707.893,"duration":30.65},{"text":"So we may ask ourselves here, what local incidents are taxable events in Minnesota?","start":707.893,"stop":716.52,"duration":8.63},{"text":"This company ships 48% of its product into Minnesota and certainly if that fact is to become a basis or a subject matter of a tax, then a totally new concept would have been annunciated.","start":716.52,"stop":731.384,"duration":14.86},{"text":"The theory of the Minnesota Supreme Court was that the volume of shipments was so substantial that such commerce in fact became localized, and thus separated from the free flow of commerce.","start":731.384,"stop":743.459,"duration":12.07},{"text":"No attempt was made by that court to define the precise buy-in necessary to affect this localization.","start":743.459,"stop":751.71,"duration":8.25},{"text":"In other words, under the theory, the Minnesota Supreme Court, the quantity of the shipment is critical.","start":751.71,"stop":758.75,"duration":7.04},{"text":"However, this Court will notice as a matter of contrast, that in a case immediately to follow this one, the Georgia case, the State of Georgia argues that it's the quality of the connection between the state and the foreign corporation that is important.","start":758.75,"stop":775.039,"duration":16.29},{"text":"And of course the reason the State of Georgia argues that is because in their case, less than 1% of that company's business was shipped in the state of Georgia.","start":775.039,"stop":784.647,"duration":9.61},{"text":"Now it would seem that neither quality nor quantity, nor regularity, could really turn interstate commerce into something that it actually is not.","start":784.647,"stop":796.639,"duration":11.99},{"text":"Now under the decisions of this Court, had this taxpayer been engaged in some intrastate activity, then such activity in and of itself might have been used as a springboard upon which to base the tax.","start":796.639,"stop":810.931,"duration":14.29},{"text":"For instance, if this taxpayer had a plant in Minnesota there would be no problem of jurisdictional due process.","start":810.931,"stop":818.503,"duration":7.57},{"text":"That was the situation in which this Court upheld levy in the Wisconsin income tax, in the case of the United States Glue Company.","start":818.503,"stop":826.659,"duration":8.16},{"text":"There the taxpayer was a domiciliary of Wisconsin and it had a manufacturing plant there, and it did a large intrastate business.","start":826.659,"stop":835.383,"duration":8.72},{"text":"The only question there was whether the statute violated the Commerce Clause, not the Due Process Clause because the substantive due process was well satisfied, and that is found in many of the cases of this Court, such as International Harvester against Evatt, Ford Motor Company against Beauchamp, West Publishing Company against McColgan, and Butler Brothers against the same Commissioner, but none of those cases was jurisdictional due process involved were there were local events.","start":835.383,"stop":866.454,"duration":31.07},{"text":"Such cases are no different.","start":866.454,"stop":869.686,"duration":3.23},{"text":"In those situations where this Court has time and time again upheld ad valorem property taxes, even though the property was used exclusively in interstate commerce.","start":869.686,"stop":881.31,"duration":11.62},{"text":"In every such instance, however, intrastate activities did exist.","start":881.31,"stop":885.941,"duration":4.63},{"text":"Similar are those cases where gross earnings taxes upheld in lieu of an ad valorem property tax.","start":885.941,"stop":893.932,"duration":7.99},{"text":"Now in Shaffer against Carter, the right of the State of Oklahoma to tax the income of a non-resident from business carried on in Oklahoma was upheld.","start":893.932,"stop":905.77,"duration":11.84},{"text":"In doing so this Court reaffirmed the doctrine, first pronounced by Justice Brewster in the Michigan Central Railroad Company case, that the only possible subjects of any tense, are persons, property and business.","start":905.77,"stop":920.607,"duration":14.84},{"text":"In the Miller Bros. case this Court again reaffirmed that principal and necessarily then the power of taxation, from a substantive jurisdictional standpoint is limited to those three subject matters, persons, property and business.","start":920.607,"stop":939.103,"duration":18.5},{"text":"The Oklahoma tax upon a non-resident was upheld because the business was in Oklahoma.","start":939.103,"stop":945.068,"duration":5.97},{"text":"Under on the same theory this Court has upheld tax levied on rental income received from real estate by a New York resident, even though the real estate was located with -- out of the state of New York.","start":945.068,"stop":958.674,"duration":13.61},{"text":"There again the subject matter was the privilege or domiciled residents of the person.","start":958.674,"stop":963.69,"duration":5.02},{"text":"It was not upon the real estate located outside of the State of New York.","start":963.69,"stop":968.459,"duration":4.77},{"text":"So too in (Inaudible) against the State of Mississippi, this Court held, and I think properly so, that Mississippi could impose an income tax, upon all of the earnings of a resident, wherever those earning were earned.","start":968.459,"stop":984.276,"duration":15.82},{"text":"The reason for it is that the subject matter of the tax was within the State of Mississippi, and in answer to Chief Justice's question, Iowa under that case could impose a tax because it's a domiciliary state upon 100% of income of this company.","start":984.276,"stop":1002.487,"duration":18.21},{"text":"But the tax in those cases is not upon income as the subject matter, it is upon the subject matter and it is measured by the income.","start":1002.487,"stop":1014.139,"duration":11.65},{"text":"In all of those instances, you will find that the state has put some benefits, it has given some protection, it's afforded some privileges, not arising out of the federal constitution itself.","start":1014.139,"stop":1028.351,"duration":14.21},{"text":"Now if we try to analyze what tax is we find that it has three matters -- sorry three elements.","start":1028.351,"stop":1036.584,"duration":8.23},{"text":"First it has a subject matter, secondly it has a measure and third it has a rate.","start":1036.584,"stop":1044.182,"duration":7.6},{"text":"Now in the Shaffer case the subject matter was said to persons, property and business.","start":1044.182,"stop":1050.684,"duration":6.5},{"text":"Legislative requirement of jurisdiction of due process applies only to the subject matter of a tax.","start":1050.684,"stop":1057.652,"duration":6.97},{"text":"Once they have satisfied that, the measure and the rate become unimportant.","start":1057.652,"stop":1062.438,"duration":4.79},{"text":"Where the subject matter is clearly defined, we have no -- we do not have much trouble with the application of due process from a substantive point of view.","start":1062.438,"stop":1071.983,"duration":9.54},{"text":"But we must recognize that modern day taxes have become so refined that it is often difficult to differentiate

the Philippine Islands, that was of the language of the taxing statute, and a Philippine concern that their business very much like Stockham, it was located in the Philippines, it has its factory there, it manufactured its goods there, and send abroad into the United States, salesmen negotiated orders and took them and sent them back for acceptance, the goods were then sent to the United

that aside immediately and said of course nobody could seriously contain that income was earned in the United States under those circumstances and that's exactly what from a due process, the states up to here is an argument that they are earning income, because one man spends one-third of his time in Georgia, and they have just a sales office there for convenience, to say that they really are earning income from Georgia, within the due process concept.","start":2981.042,"stop":3019.046,"duration":38},{"text":"I think that border concept is all the more important, when you consider the all
