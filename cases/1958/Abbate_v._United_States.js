case.","start":169.342,"stop":175.639,"duration":6.3},{"text":"The indictments arise out of activities of some men in connection with a -- with a strike of the Southern Bell Telephone Company.","start":175.639,"stop":188.183,"duration":12.54},{"text":"A man by the name of Shelby, who was an international representative of the -- of the union, came to Chicago and communicated with a man by the name of (Inaudible)","start":188.183,"stop":198.613,"duration":10.43},{"text":"Apparently, he was seeking somebody to help him destroy the communications on the properties of the Southern Bell Telephone Company for the purpose of expediting the settlement of the strike.","start":198.613,"stop":212.143,"duration":13.53},{"text":"This man, (Inaudible), that is the record, communicated

also from Mississippi and lived at the time in Maryland and a man by the name of Perry, who was the -- the president of the local in Jackson, Mississippi where the act of violence had taken place.","start":223.52,"stop":241.933,"duration":18.41},{"text":"And so, we find that Shelby contacts Mr. Abbate and there is a meeting between Abbate, Falcone and a man by the name of McLeod who was not indicted in this case and Shelby.","start":241.933,"stop":255.291,"duration":13.36},{"text":"Shelby has with him the plans for the destruction of the -- of the various installations marked.","start":255.291,"stop":262.326,"duration":7.04},{"text":"Shelby had worked for the Southern Bell Telephone Company.","start":262.326,"stop":265.282,"duration":2.96},{"text":"He knew the whereabouts of the various installations.","start":265.282,"stop":268.654,"duration":3.37},{"text":"So, on the plans, they were located at various spots where he thought they ought to destroy.","start":268.654,"stop":275.29,"duration":6.64},{"text":"He gave Abbate $500 as a down payment and said that if they carried out their job, there would be more money afforded.","start":275.29,"stop":285.914,"duration":10.62},{"text":"There is an effort made by Falcone to get some dynamite, I think it was a pretext.","start":285.914,"stop":293.11,"duration":7.2},{"text":"I don't think Falcone, for the record, could ever get an indictment.","start":293.11,"stop":298.467,"duration":5.36},{"text":"The next day -- the next day, the petitioners, Abbate and Falcone, tell McLeod.","start":298.467,"stop":304.276,"duration":5.81},{"text":"McLeod was a man who is on parole from Oklahoma for having committed a robbery.","start":304.276,"stop":311.04,"duration":6.76},{"text":"They told McLeod that they wanted no part of this deal and that they could make more money by conveying this information to the telephone company.","start":311.04,"stop":320.729,"duration":9.69},{"text":"They gave him part of the $500 and McLeod insisted on going down to Jackson, Mississippi.","start":320.729,"stop":327.879,"duration":7.15},{"text":"McLeod, when he gets to Jackson, Mississippi meets Perry who was the president of the local down there and he also meets Shelby.","start":327.879,"stop":336.65,"duration":8.77},{"text":"One of the men connected with the union took McLeod around and showed him where the various locations where they were located.","start":336.65,"stop":346.491,"duration":9.84},{"text":"We expect to show from the record that both Perry and Shelby began to have misgivings about McLeod.","start":346.491,"stop":354.365,"duration":7.87},{"text":"And so, they took him forcibly.","start":354.365,"stop":356.511,"duration":2.15},{"text":"He protested.","start":356.511,"stop":357.276,"duration":0.76},{"text":"He wanted to stay there and blow up the installation.","start":357.276,"stop":360.135,"duration":2.86},{"text":"But they took him forcibly to a railroad station and sent him back to Chicago.","start":360.135,"stop":365.551,"duration":5.42},{"text":"In the meantime -- in the meantime Abbate and McLeod almost the next day the record shows -- almost the next day after meeting Shelby, communicated with the telephone company and told them that they had information in reference to plans for the destruction of these installations.","start":365.551,"stop":386.124,"duration":20.57},{"text":"We expect to show at the most perhaps four or five days later there are conversations between Abbate and the officials for the telephone company.","start":386.124,"stop":396.447,"duration":10.32},{"text":"There was a meeting arranged between the -- the telephone officials who is an investigator and a policeman acting as -- as a member of the -- of the telephone company.","start":396.447,"stop":406.322,"duration":9.88},{"text":"They meet with Abbate and Falcone at which time the two petitioners are arrested.","start":406.322,"stop":414.508,"duration":8.19},{"text":"They gave him the plans that Shelby had given them, gave him all the information and reference to this plan with the scheme to destroy this communication.","start":414.508,"stop":424.336,"duration":9.83},{"text":"And as part -- and -- and they didn't give him the reward.","start":424.336,"stop":427.257,"duration":2.92},{"text":"Instead of giving him a reward, they -- they indicted, and charged him with a conspiracy to destroy the property of Southern Bell Telephone Company.","start":427.257,"stop":435.335,"duration":8.08},{"text":"Now, the -- the judge who heard this case in the criminal courts of Cook County, I suppose, took into consideration the fact that these men have almost immediately abandoned the enterprise.","start":435.335,"stop":448.658,"duration":13.32},{"text":"I had raised the question on the Court of Appeals that there was abandonment but the Court of Appeals removed otherwise.","start":448.658,"stop":456.688,"duration":8.03},{"text":"And in -- and in Illinois there is no need of an (Inaudible) act -- the mere -- the mere agreement between the parties, a decision to constitute a conspiracy whereas in the federal court, there must be some covered act.","start":456.688,"stop":469.448,"duration":12.76},{"text":"But the judge took into consideration that these men had come clean.","start":469.448,"stop":473.593,"duration":4.15},{"text":"They had conveyed all the information, had told it to the telephone company, had informed the police and the State's Attorney, and so the -- why judge gave them not more than 90 days to both defendants.","start":473.593,"stop":488.361,"duration":14.77},{"text":"After the defendants had served their time, the petitioners had served their time, an attorney for the Southern Bell Telephone Company came to visit McLeod who has been taken back to Oklahoma prison.","start":488.361,"stop":502.84,"duration":14.48},{"text":"And this is important because it's in the record and in some ways those -- and refers or to the -- to the other case that Mr. Fisher had, the Bartkus case.","start":502.84,"stop":516.081,"duration":13.24},{"text":"The attorney for the telephone company came to McLeod and said, \"I want your help.","start":516.081,"stop":522.077,"duration":6},{"text":"The telephone company wants your help.","start":522.077,"stop":524.75,"duration":2.67},{"text":"Now, you can help the telephone company by testifying for the Government.\" And so -- and so the deal was made.","start":524.75,"stop":533.615,"duration":8.87},{"text":"McLeod was never indicted.","start":533.615,"stop":535.829,"duration":2.21},{"text":"And I think in my petition for rehearing before the Court of Appeals, I -- I think I stated that there was a news item that appeared in the -- in the Southern Newspapers that McLeod had been given a parole at the instance of the telephone company and had been given a reward of $7500 for his aid of the telephone company.","start":535.829,"stop":557.446,"duration":21.62},{"text":"But McLeod agrees to testify for the -- the Government and there is this trial and there is this -- this conviction in this case.","start":557.446,"stop":569.143,"duration":11.7},{"text":"Now, it's important to know just what properties the telephone -- the Government had which they claim was the subject of this conspiracy.","start":569.143,"stop":582.77,"duration":13.63},{"text":"The evidence shows that it was directed at coaxial -- at a coaxial cable and the evidence showed that the coaxial cable was capable of transmitting 2400 conversations.","start":582.77,"stop":598.418,"duration":15.65},{"text":"Out of these, the Government had leased, owned, or operate -- or controlled rather, not owned, leased, operated, and controlled 20 circuits of the 2400 circuits of the coaxial cable.","start":598.418,"stop":612.644,"duration":14.23},{"text":"And so we find that the state prosecution was directed at all the properties of the Southern Bell Telephone Company.","start":612.644,"stop":621.372,"duration":8.73},{"text":"The Government takes only 20 circuits out of the 2400 circuits in that coaxial cable and says, \"That belongs to me.","start":621.372,"stop":629.144,"duration":7.77},{"text":"We'll indict you on that,\" as that's -- that's what they did.","start":629.144,"stop":633.742,"duration":4.6},{"text":"Well, in spite of the fact that the jury perhaps got the grip of what these two petitioners had done and the jury recommended leniency as to one but there wasn't much leniency to get it.","start":633.742,"stop":648.853,"duration":15.11},{"text":"And one who has recommended leniency got one year and the others all -- all got three years.","start":648.853,"stop":655.4,"duration":6.55},{"text":"Now, it is our position and we concede that the Federal Government within the framework of its constitution and the States may deal with the same subject matter and thereby have concurrent jurisdiction.","start":655.4,"stop":672.628,"duration":17.23},{"text":"And there -- there's no question about it.","start":672.628,"stop":675.662,"duration":3.03},{"text":"We also concede that each sovereignty within the framework of the Constitution has the right to determine what shall be a defense against the peace and dignity of its sovereignty.","start":675.662,"stop":686.743,"duration":11.08},{"text":"However, the dual doctrine should not be extended to areas in which its application causes a violation of the basic concept of justice which occurred in this case where the -- where two men are convicted and given a sentence and then taken -- taken broadly from Chicago and taken back to Mississippi, that is hundreds of miles where they're forced to stand trial so far away from their homes, with all the difficulties that go with a -- with a second trial.","start":686.743,"stop":722.886,"duration":36.14},{"text":"And there's something basically unjust about convicting a man twice.","start":722.886,"stop":728.828,"duration":5.94},{"text":"Mr. Fisher in his -- in his brief says, an -- an acquittal is perhaps worse.","start":728.828,"stop":734.178,"duration":5.35},{"text":"I -- I disagree with my learned friend.","start":734.178,"stop":736.66,"duration":2.48},{"text":"I think double convictions are worse.","start":736.66,"stop":739.048,"duration":2.39},{"text":"I think it's worse to convict a man once and then convict him again.","start":739.048,"stop":750.117,"duration":11.07},{"text":"We say this.","start":750.117,"stop":750.934,"duration":0.82},{"text":"That to permit the -- the doctrine of dual sovereignty to extend to this and to nullify the protection of the Fifth Amendment will leave open a large area of concurrent jurisdiction to which accused persons may not avail themselves of the right of the Fifth Amendment not to be tried twice.","start":750.934,"stop":774.897,"duration":23.96},{"text":"I predict, may it please the Court, and I practiced for many years both as a prosecutor and as a defense lawyer, I predict that if -- if these convictions are prevented to stand that it will open up a great distance of prosecution by the Government on the one hand and by the State.","start":774.897,"stop":797.664,"duration":22.77},{"text":"We're asking no more than the Court to apply what was the common law rule at one time before the -- the so-called (Inaudible).","start":797.664,"stop":811.852,"duration":14.19},{"text":"The Government in its argument says this isn't the same effects.","start":811.852,"stop":817.653,"duration":5.8},{"text":"But it is the same effects because the offense in -- in Cook County, Illinois was conspiracy which means an agreement to do an illegal thing or to do unlawful thing by illegal means.","start":817.653,"stop":831.048,"duration":13.39},{"text":"The charge in the federal court was also a conspiracy.","start":831.048,"stop":834.097,"duration":3.05},{"text":"It was again an agreement to do an illegal thing and the -- the gist of a conspiracy is the unlawful combination of men and their punishment for that.","start":834.097,"stop":846.962,"duration":12.87},{"text":"And the remarkable thing is that the substance of offense in this case is only punishable by three years, whereas the conspiracy charged here is punishable up to five years.","start":846.962,"stop":863.084,"duration":16.12},{"text":"The Government argues in its brief that the federal offense is not the same as the state offense because there's additional element here which had to be proved, though that this operation and control.","start":863.084,"stop":877.574,"duration":14.49},{"text":"And it is our position that is a matter of jurisdiction just the same as in a -- in a civil -- in a -- in a state case.","start":877.574,"stop":886.278,"duration":8.7},{"text":"The -- the prosecutor must prove that it occurred within a certain county in the State.","start":886.278,"stop":891.42,"duration":5.14},{"text":"And there is really no difference.","start":891.42,"stop":893.729,"duration":2.31},{"text":"I see no difference but a verbal difference between the charge contained in the indictment in Illinois and the indictment contained in the -- in the federal court.","start":893.729,"stop":908.483,"duration":14.75},{"text":"It is argued by the Government that it is not advisable to permit a state prosecution to preclude federal enforcement of the law.","start":908.483,"stop":918.91,"duration":10.43},{"text":"We don't quarrel about that the Federal Government has a right to enforce the law but they could have tried -- they could have tried the petitioners before the State.","start":918.91,"stop":931.709,"duration":12.8},{"text":"The

the field and still has no excuse for convicting a man twice.","start":936.851,"stop":947.059,"duration":10.21},{"text":"And this is the first time this Honorable Court has had a chance to pass on
