the shipowners and the U.S. Government.","start":30.249,"stop":60.982,"duration":30.73},{"text":"Mindfully aware of the fact that this problem has been presented to this Court some 10 years ago in the Johansen and the Mendel cases.","start":60.982,"stop":73.461,"duration":12.48},{"text":"But at that time, it seems that a reading of the cases and the opinions from the District Courts up including this Honorable nor these body's reports on the various items that were considered that the problem was considered as separate, unilateral matters instead of taking the entire field, entire material, in determining where are we heading and are we adding confusion to turmoil?","start":73.461,"stop":111.506,"duration":38.05},{"text":"We must consider the problem from its very beginning.","start":111.506,"stop":118.865,"duration":7.36},{"text":"The United States Government when it first started to operate vessels did so solely for the purpose of creating a -- an auxiliary to its defense.","start":118.865,"stop":133.058,"duration":14.19},{"text":"But it went beyond that and went into business, the same as the man who was selling dresses on the corner

where do we start?","start":227.353,"stop":229.321,"duration":1.97},{"text":"With the United States Government first went into the business of the merchant marine back in 1916 with the Shipping Act pursuant to the provisions of which the Emergency Fleet Corporation was created then we had all the troubles that this Court was fully aware of where our vessels were seized and then we have the flag case where this Court held that an action in rem would lie against the vessels although the Government had not waived sovereign immunity.","start":229.321,"stop":265.002,"duration":35.68},{"text":"Then we had the Public Vessels Act, the suits in Admiralty Act followed by the Public Vessels Act which took away the right to libel the vessels in rem but did create a new light, that is an action in personam against the government.","start":265.002,"stop":282.621,"duration":17.62},{"text":"We went from there to various corporations, companies, and entities which were formed like the mechanical division of the Panama Canal.","start":282.621,"stop":292.591,"duration":9.97},{"text":"Then we have the Inland Waterways Corporation, the War Shipping Administration, all makeshift means and methods of meeting sudden emergencies.","start":292.591,"stop":302.819,"duration":10.23},{"text":"And all of these were created for a temporary time to meet an immediate need but never was it intended that the U.S. Government should go into the business permanently of being a merchant shipper.As these different entities were formed and then changed from one to the other, the mechanical division of the Panama Canal was taken over by the Panama Canal Corporation.","start":302.819,"stop":328.552,"duration":25.73},{"text":"The Inland Waterways Corporation was taken over by the Department of Commerce in 1939.","start":328.552,"stop":334.76,"duration":6.21},{"text":"The War Shipping Administration had -- was ended and its functions were taken over by the Maritime Commission for liquidation and the

troubles.","start":346.379,"stop":351.239,"duration":4.86},{"text":"Now, we didn't know -- we just don't know where to go that's why we're here.","start":351.239,"stop":353.889,"duration":2.65},{"text":"We want to know what -- what are we to do?","start":353.889,"stop":356.906,"duration":3.02},{"text":"Now, if a seamen as the U.S. Code States any man working on a ship of the Government is a seaman except an apprentice, if a seaman is to be judged by the scale that his work shall determine his rights then we're entitled to bring our actions against the U.S. Government regardless under what name or in whose name the shipper is operating.","start":356.906,"stop":386.417,"duration":29.51},{"text":"If the right sought to be judged by the title then before I can tell my perspective client, you'll have a cause of action, I have to come down to Washington and endeavor the impossible, find out what kind of cargo was carried on the ship.","start":386.417,"stop":402.568,"duration":16.15},{"text":"Now to me that seems a little ridiculous that the right a seamen should depend upon what is the number five hold and who knows what was there after that ship lands as a practical matter, nobody.","start":402.568,"stop":414.913,"duration":12.35},{"text":"You just can't find out what was carried in the number four and number five hold and what was that cargo?","start":414.913,"stop":422.321,"duration":7.41},{"text":"And if that is to determine the right of the man to a cause of action then I for one certainly don't see the justice of it.","start":422.321,"stop":431.918,"duration":9.6},{"text":"This Court has expressed itself time and the gain that we are dealing with a practical proposition.","start":431.918,"stop":438.499,"duration":6.58},{"text":"Congress has stated time and again that it wants seamen to be considered, as words of the Court, that they are entitled to have any doubtful issues resolved in their favor.","start":438.499,"stop":457.303,"duration":18.8},{"text":"They have further expressed in every Act, that nothing contained in this Act shall affect their rights, of officers, of members, of the crew.","start":457.303,"stop":467.495,"duration":10.19},{"text":"Now, we had some question come up on whether or not the 1949 Amendments of the Federal Employees Compensation Act changed the rights of seamen, of course not.","start":467.495,"stop":484.619,"duration":17.12},{"text":"If they had any rights before they had them after and if they didn't, they don't have it after.","start":484.619,"stop":490.76,"duration":6.14},{"text":"But that isn't the basis of my being here.","start":490.76,"stop":493.853,"duration":3.09},{"text":"It seems to me that insofar as the -- when the Inland Waterways Corporation was formed, nothing was said about anybody working for the Inland Waterways Corporation or for a subcontractor or agent of the Corporation having any rights under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.","start":493.853,"stop":518.926,"duration":25.07},{"text":"And the 1949 Amendment was -- one of the purposes was to include employees of the Inland Waterways Corporation within the benefits of that Act, but they said not seamen, not members of the crew, indicating that legislature -- with every a statute says that.","start":518.926,"stop":537.792,"duration":18.87},{"text":"Every time Congress spoke it said, “But not seamen, not members of the crew.”","start":537.792,"stop":543.652,"duration":5.86},{"text":"So when -- when we have the Public Vessels Acts enacted that also gave us some confusion and some concern.","start":543.652,"stop":551.535,"duration":7.88},{"text":"Now, this Court and the American Stevedore against Porella, stricken that problem out and said, “Well, it doesn't matter that the Act does not specifically say that a seaman may -- may or may not sue.”","start":551.535,"stop":566.445,"duration":14.91},{"text":"Nothing was said in the Public Vessels Act and that time Mr. Justice Frankfurter, you didn't seem to agree with our argument but since then I thought your expressions indicate that we're dealing with the practical problem.","start":566.445,"stop":577.131,"duration":10.69}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"I didn't (Inaudible), I mean, the results, did

up for consideration by the 77th Congress and the General Counsel to the War Shipping Administration was asked for his opinion, he said if I can remember correctly, I think Mr. Colby has quoted it on
