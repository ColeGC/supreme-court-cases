its brief that everything that had subsequently considered was talked about in this hearing before the Industrial Employment Review Board.","start":371.089,"stop":383.228,"duration":12.14},{"text":"I don't think that's quite accurate because I think there was one matter which cannot fairly be said to appear in that -- in that earlier hearing and that is the matter of Greene's having worked as a consultant for Mr. Laughlin Currie, a one time Presidential Assistant.","start":383.228,"stop":404.346,"duration":21.12},{"text":"At any event, this Board examined all of this material and restored Greene's clearance, then he went back to work for ERCO and the Navy insist -- continued to insist that ERCO do this work as fast as possible, and this was the situation until the following year.","start":404.346,"stop":428.727,"duration":24.38},{"text":"And in April of 1953, and this was six years after anything that the Government had alleged or had considered or that we ever learned about as being direct derogatory information, the Secretary of the Navy wrote a letter to ERCO.","start":428.727,"stop":452.917,"duration":24.19},{"text":"And this was a very short letter and what it says is, \"I have reviewed the case history of William Lewis Greene and pursuant to this contract, I direct you or I request you to exclude him from your plans and to deny him access to classified information.","start":452.917,"stop":473.694,"duration":20.78},{"text":"And I think the phraseology is important because they are not, at this point, talking about denying access to classified information.","start":473.694,"stop":481.792,"duration":8.1},{"text":"They are telling a private employer that he may not admit his own employee to his own plant.","start":481.792,"stop":489.983,"duration":8.19},{"text":"Now, this letter was sent to ERCO and the Government stipulates that they never sent any letter to Greene about it.","start":489.983,"stop":499.393,"duration":9.41},{"text":"And the -- the letter recited no reasons for a change, although at the time there was a directive from Mr. Wilson, the Secretary of Defense, saying that the Secretaries were to continue to apply the -- the criteria applied by the Industrial Employment Review Board.","start":499.393,"stop":519.688,"duration":20.3},{"text":"Now, the next thing that happened was that Mr. Wells, the President of ERCO, wrote to the Secretary of -- of the Navy and said, \"This man is very valuable to us.","start":519.688,"stop":537.917,"duration":18.23},{"text":"Not having him is a great blow to the company.","start":537.917,"stop":541.028,"duration":3.11},{"text":"May we come in and talk this over with you?\"","start":541.028,"stop":545.182,"duration":4.15},{"text":"And the answer of Mr. Anderson was, \"There isn't any purpose and any further discussion of his case.\"","start":545.182,"stop":555.292,"duration":10.11},{"text":"So Greene was out.","start":555.292,"stop":559.08,"duration":3.79},{"text":"The trial judge in this case described what ERCO did as a willing compliance with the request of the Government.","start":559.08,"stop":568.3,"duration":9.22},{"text":"But what ERCO actually did was to, as the record shows, hold this job open for Greene for over a year, hoping that he could get clearance.","start":568.3,"stop":579.638,"duration":11.34},{"text":"This is still in 1953.","start":579.638,"stop":585.256,"duration":5.62},{"text":"They wrote Greene saying, \"Please, get it cleared up.","start":585.256,"stop":589.347,"duration":4.09},{"text":"If there is anything ERCO can do to help you by way of evidence, let us know.\"","start":589.347,"stop":595.916,"duration":6.57},{"text":"And Mr. Berliner, Colonel Berliner, the Chairman of the Board, the principle stockholder of ERCO, made an affidavit that he would -- there was no reason for Greene's discharge except their letter that they received from the Secretary of the Navy.","start":595.916,"stop":618.074,"duration":22.16},{"text":"He also, at -- in the testimony before the hearing which subsequently occurred, he testified that he would stake his entire company on Mr. Greene's judgment as to the -- his ability to build this flight simulator.","start":618.074,"stop":640.64,"duration":22.57},{"text":"I think there are few employees who have received a more convincing demonstration of their employer's confidence.","start":640.64,"stop":652.916,"duration":12.28},{"text":"After a great deal of effort, the Secretary of the Navy, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in response to a request -- to a

material.","start":943.583,"stop":970.799,"duration":27.22},{"text":"Now, coming to the issues, as I see them in this case, we are first met with the problem of what is it the Government did?","start":970.799,"stop":987.235,"duration":16.44},{"text":"The Government says, \"We merely denied this man access, and any damage was consequential.\"","start":987.235,"stop":995.234,"duration":8},{"text":"But in their brief, they admit in the face of what they cannot practically deny that to a man in the profession of aeronautical

classified information of the Government -- that belongs to the Government.\"","start":1035.335,"stop":1045.842,"duration":10.51},{"text":"But the Government does not limit its claim of employment to the control of classified information for two reasons.","start":1045.842,"stop":1057.134,"duration":11.29},{"text":"First, as we show in our brief, you cannot be an officer of a corporation without clearance.","start":1057.134,"stop":1064.786,"duration":7.65},{"text":"And as the Vice President and General Manager of ERCO, Greene was, of course, a corporation officer.","start":1064.786,"stop":1071.659,"duration":6.87},{"text":"And there are, I suggest, many officers of a corporation who do not need access to classified information.","start":1071.659,"stop":1080.116,"duration":8.46},{"text":"And as the Solicitor General said yesterday, this isn't -- in any case, this is not free access to all the secrets of the Government.","start":1080.116,"stop":1090.354,"duration":10.24},{"text":"This is access to that information which you need to perform your duties on the contracts that your employer is doing for the

controlling or attempting to control the officers of corporations.","start":1114.888,"stop":1122.23,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Furthermore, and this case demonstrates, the Government is not limiting its control to ownership -- to -- to material of which it really has ownership because the executive order which is put -- which is stated in -- in its text in -- as an appendix to our brief says that whether or not you produce this -- this information, if the Government classified it, you may not have access without clearance, that is it's subject to control under that executive order.","start":1122.23,"stop":1172.572,"duration":50.34},{"text":"So, here, you get some information that the Government had, but it isn't valuable.","start":1172.572,"stop":1180.316,"duration":7.74},{"text":"It is invaluable until a man, like Greene, makes the engineering flow that turns it into something that's useful, and it isn't valuable I suggest until a man, like Taylor turns it out on the lays in a -- in the form of a useful thing and this is what the Government is controlling.","start":1180.316,"stop":1203.289,"duration":22.97},{"text":"Now, this is what the Government says.","start":1203.289,"stop":1208.291,"duration":5},{"text":"They -- they have a right to control and let me suggest, if I may, that the way the Secretary of the Navy handled this case indicates exactly what the Government does claim and what the Government repeats in its brief, I suggest, in this Court which is that this is an absolute power, that it is unrestrained, that nobody can question and because those are relatively strong statements, I -- I think I should read from page 43 of the Government's brief in the Greene case.","start":1208.291,"stop":1251.898,"duration":43.61},{"text":"Down towards the bottom, \"That the executive may ultimately act in this area on mere doubts or

that this man is in fact both loyal and discreet.\"","start":1281.751,"stop":1317.601,"duration":35.85},{"text":"Now, this, I'm -- I would like to say as a slanting reply to what Mr. -- what the

arbitrary or discriminatory.","start":1334.496,"stop":1361.399,"duration":26.9},{"text":"And this Court has many times said that government officials may not act in an arbitrary fashion, may not draw irrational or dogmatic inferences from facts.","start":1361.399,"stop":1384.224,"duration":22.83},{"text":"Now, I think, unless you are going to be -- to accept what is a clear transparency, the

industry.","start":1384.224,"stop":1414.567,"duration":30.34},{"text":"I -- I think that it is impossible to determine this kind of a case without facing the
