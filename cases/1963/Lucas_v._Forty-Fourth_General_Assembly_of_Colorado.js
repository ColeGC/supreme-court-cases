Court.","start":13.118,"stop":16.923,"duration":3.8},{"text":"Yesterday, I had outlined our reasons for suggesting that on the merits, this case comes down to the question, whether the per capita inequalities are so severe, so serious in relation to any permissible objective that they might be thought to attain as to constitute a denial of the Equal Protection of the laws.","start":16.923,"stop":46.116,"duration":29.19},{"text":"Let me first say a word about the inequalities themselves.","start":46.116,"stop":51.407,"duration":5.29},{"text":"The basic figures that pertain to the Senate are most conveniently set forth in this case I think in Appendix C to the opinion of the District Court which of course, appears in the back of the jurisdictional statement and they begin on Page 74 run over for a few additional pages.","start":51.407,"stop":74.152,"duration":22.75},{"text":"We attempted to relate them to geography by this map that I asked the clerk to distribute yesterday, which preserves the numbering of the districts as they are in the opinion of the court below and which shows their size and shape and also the average number of people per senator in each district and the population of each county.","start":74.152,"stop":102.714,"duration":28.56},{"text":"Finally, it maybe helpful to point out one-third document, then I think Court will know what they all are, in this blue volume, which is the Appellees' Exhibit D, there is a useful topographical map on the inside of the back cover.","start":102.714,"stop":121.417,"duration":18.7},{"text":"I am not going to ask Your Honors to follow all three at once, but you may find it useful in your study of the case in chambers.","start":121.417,"stop":132.816,"duration":11.4},{"text":"The inequalities run most severely against El Paso County, which appears on our map as Districts 11 and 12 just to the right of the middle.","start":132.816,"stop":149.385,"duration":16.57},{"text":"Now that contains the Colorado Springs area and there you will note that there is one senator for each 71,000 people.","start":149.385,"stop":160.313,"duration":10.93},{"text":"At the other extreme is District 23, Las Animas County, which is down on the right bottom of Colorado, a little to the right of the center, where you will note that there is one senator for 19,000, almost 20,000 people, the ratio versus El Paso County being 3.5:1.","start":160.313,"stop":184.204,"duration":23.89},{"text":"As a matter of fact, there are five counties that have more than three times the per capita representation of a person living in El Paso County.","start":184.204,"stop":198.917,"duration":14.71},{"text":"There are three counties that have three times the representation of a person living in Jefferson County which is in the center of the state right next to Denver and which of course, is a suburb of Denver.","start":198.917,"stop":215.706,"duration":16.79},{"text":"Denver, the little dot, almost in the middle which we've identified by a line as District 28 has only half the per capita representation of the people in seven counties.","start":215.706,"stop":235.953,"duration":20.25},{"text":"The result of these comparisons, and of course, the Court will want to study them is a very striking departure from equality and the principle of majority rule.","start":235.953,"stop":249.942,"duration":13.99},{"text":"A numerical majority of the Colorado senate can be elected from counties containing less that one-third of the people of Colorado.","start":249.942,"stop":262.907,"duration":12.96},{"text":"Denver and the three adjacent counties, those touching upon it, plus Pueblo, and Colorado Springs have in excess of 63% of the population and less than a majority of the Senate.","start":262.907,"stop":279.849,"duration":16.94},{"text":"I would emphasize in addition that these imbalances are getting worse.","start":279.849,"stop":285.308,"duration":5.46},{"text":"Of course, the case must be judged as of today, but nevertheless we are dealing as it were with things in motion, like in airplane.","start":285.308,"stop":294.006,"duration":8.7},{"text":"The imbalance for example on the figures for January 1964 is such that now it takes only a little over 31% of the counties having only a little over 31% of the population to elect a majority of the people.","start":294.006,"stop":309.846,"duration":15.84},{"text":"Denver and its suburbs today have a majority of the population and only 14 out of 39 senators, hardly more than one-third.","start":309.846,"stop":323.251,"duration":13.4},{"text":"With that general picture in mind, I turn to the objectives that are said to justify this lack of per capita equality.","start":323.251,"stop":337.094,"duration":13.84},{"text":"Some of them as Mr. Creamer pointed out yesterday are plainly impermissible.","start":337.094,"stop":343.103,"duration":6.01},{"text":"They are, if they were the basis of the distinctions alone, one could call them invidious discrimination.","start":343.103,"stop":351.401,"duration":8.3},{"text":"For example, the opinion below seems to adopt the view expressed by the witness Rogers and one of the other witnesses, that voters who lived in heavily populated areas aren't worth as much as voters who live in the country.","start":351.401,"stop":369.443,"duration":18.04},{"text":"That it seems is clearly an impermissible ground for differentiation as we've argued in the other cases and as we think Gray and Sanders clearly held.","start":369.443,"stop":382.377,"duration":12.93},{"text":"Again, it seems to us that balancing the economic interests of different parts of the state is a plainly impermissible consideration, for reasons that Mr. Creamer very well stated and that I will attempt to repeat.","start":382.377,"stop":401.727,"duration":19.35},{"text":"I say just word about them.","start":401.727,"stop":404.634,"duration":2.91},{"text":"Appellees say that this is simply a play upon words, that the senators aren't representing economic interest, they are representing people, and of course, that's true, but we submit that they are not entitled to represent people of one economic

districts small and considerations like that, that cut against it.","start":552.144,"stop":563.931,"duration":11.79},{"text":"And so here, we think there have been mentioned a number of considerations that at least do go in the direction of supporting this apportion.","start":563.931,"stop":579.433,"duration":15.5},{"text":"If I were stating them I would put it this way.","start":579.433,"stop":583.613,"duration":4.18},{"text":"I'd say that among the permissible objectives are to try and keep the Senate a small enough body to be deliberated.","start":583.613,"stop":592.859,"duration":9.25},{"text":"Colorado has always had a small senate.","start":592.859,"stop":595.822,"duration":2.96},{"text":"That another desirable objective and a permissible one is to have the senators familiar with their districts and the people in the districts are readily familiar with the Senators which requires trying to keep them smaller area and it requires bearing in mind considerations of accessibility which sometimes cause strange shapes in a state like Colorado.","start":595.822,"stop":626.49,"duration":30.67},{"text":"Again, I would argue, if I were supporting with saying what can be said here for their side of the case, that there is something to be said for following county lines because they have some political significance independent of the Senatorial district.","start":626.49,"stop":642.768,"duration":16.28},{"text":"And that is a fact which we would say maybe taken account of in the districting and which may compel some divergence from strict per capita representation which we assume for the sake of argument to be permissible.","start":642.768,"stop":659.739,"duration":16.97},{"text":"Our difficulty in this case is that when all that has been said, it seems to us that it won't justify the apportionment for two reasons.","start":659.739,"stop":670.779,"duration":11.04},{"text":"Mr. Creamer dealt with one of them and I simply refer to what he said.","start":670.779,"stop":677.192,"duration":6.41},{"text":"We think that the opinion below greatly overemphasizes the problems of accessibility and shape and size, and greatly underemphasizes the importance of being equally represented in the legislature.","start":677.192,"stop":692.404,"duration":15.21},{"text":"Our second objection is that we think the arguments are insufficient here on the whole because all those objectives which we assume to be permissible can be substantially achieved without creating inequalities anywhere nearest areas as those that exist here.","start":692.404,"stop":714.228,"duration":21.82},{"text":"And we say that to create severe discrimination in a way unnecessary to achieve the only permissible objectives that I've mentioned, plainly unnecessary to achieve it, is arbitrary in this field and capricious and therefore a denial of Equal Protection.","start":714.228,"stop":735.29,"duration":21.06},{"text":"We suggested two ways in which the objectives could be attained in our brief.","start":735.29,"stop":740.753,"duration":5.46},{"text":"The simpler of the two, I'd like to take just a minute to suggest with the help of a map.","start":740.753,"stop":749.836,"duration":9.08},{"text":"Down in this very center at the bottom of the map, is District 30 with one Senator for 22,000 and some people, one of the most overrepresented districts in the state.","start":749.836,"stop":766.283,"duration":16.45},{"text":"Now we can see no reason that that district shouldn't be split along the line of the blue line.","start":766.283,"stop":776.372,"duration":10.09},{"text":"There can be no topographical objection that follows the ridge of the Sangre de Cristo mountain range until it drops south, it follows county lines, and neither of the resulting districts, 31 or 23 as they are now numbered, taking out the line with the blue Z on it, would be excessive either in population or in size.","start":776.372,"stop":804.097,"duration":27.73},{"text":"Indeed there are other districts which are bigger than the other would be and neither would have in access to which

the map, that if the line between districts 24 and 25 were removed and those two were added together, you would have a district with 40,000 people, just a little under the theoretically perfect number for a Senator, the area again would not be the biggest in the state.","start":815.304,"stop":841.504,"duration":26.2},{"text":"It's a little large but not out of proportion with the others.","start":841.504,"stop":846.356,"duration":4.85},{"text":"Communications, judging from the roads and the flow of traffic is quite accessible.","start":846.356,"stop":852.687,"duration":6.33},{"text":"The difference between the two most distant points is less than the differences than the distances between the two most distant points, and some other counties of equally rough if not rougher terrain and this too seems to be an obvious simple way of less than inequality.","start":852.687,"stop":873.872,"duration":21.18},{"text":"Now this would free two Senators.","start":873.872,"stop":877.952,"duration":4.08},{"text":"If one were given to El Paso County, the people in that county which are now the most underrepresented, instead of having 60%, 63% of what they should have, would have almost the ideal representation, a little under.","start":877.952,"stop":894.217,"duration":16.26},{"text":"If the other were given to Denver County, the people of Denver County instead of having 73% of what they ought to have would have an excess of 80%.","start":894.217,"stop":904.795,"duration":10.58},{"text":"Appeelles in their reply brief rather pull this and say well, that's just two senators out of a legislature of in excess of 100 members, I suggest that the proper comparison is with the total size of the senate 39 and that a shift of two senators in A 39-man senate may make a very great difference indeed and this I used to -- I hope I used them fairly bear this out.","start":904.795,"stop":932.683,"duration":27.89},{"text":"Instead of having less than a third of the people elective majority of the senate it would take a minimum of 40%, counties having 40% of the people, a much better figure.","start":932.683,"stop":946.495,"duration":13.81},{"text":"Denver and the three adjacent counties plus El Peso and Pueblo now have almost 64% of the population and only 18 out of 39 senators.","start":946.495,"stop":959.017,"duration":12.52},{"text":"This would give them a majority in the senate.","start":959.017,"stop":962.593,"duration":3.58},{"text":"Put still another way are the change of just these two would substantially improve the representation of 37% of the people of Colorado and I submit that it would sacrifice non of the objectives that the appeellees say they're seeking to obtain or certainly not substantially

apportionment.","start":995.577,"stop":1004.345,"duration":8.77},{"text":"The important point is that if it is that easy to make so substantial a change in the direction of more equal per capita representation then it shows that these imbalances go way beyond anything that could be deemed reasonably necessary to achieve their objectives and that we submit is arbitrary and capricious in this important area.","start":1004.345,"stop":1031.253,"duration":26.91},{"text":"Now I would like hurrying on because of the shortage of time to take just a minute on the other issue in the case.","start":1031.253,"stop":1041.71,"duration":10.46},{"text":"We suggested that there is a real question here as to whether the Bill should be dismissed for want of equity.","start":1041.71,"stop":1048.457,"duration":6.75},{"text":"We recognize, indeed we urge most strongly that the political picket, the phrase sometimes mentioned in this connection is clearly not a reason alone for dismissing a Bill for want of equity, and that has been clearly decided in the Wesberry case, and we take that as a premise.","start":1048.457,"stop":1069.653,"duration":21.2},{"text":"This case does have some very unusual circumstances.","start":1069.653,"stop":1075.476,"duration":5.82},{"text":"This is not an ancient apportionment as in so many cases; the issue was debated for 10 years in Colorado.","start":1075.476,"stop":1084.331,"duration":8.85},{"text":"This apportionment was approved in each and every county by a majority of the voters.","start":1084.331,"stop":1091.273,"duration":6.94},{"text":"And the initiative and referendum are also invoked as a political ribbon.","start":1091.273,"stop":1097.21,"duration":5.94},{"text":"Now, we'd urge first that the mere fact of majority approved of an apportionment, even a current apportionment is not a reason for dismissing a Bill for want of equity automatically and we have two reasons.","start":1097.21,"stop":1113.85,"duration":16.64},{"text":"In the first place, the Equal Protection Clause is designed to protect the minorities and to take a case like Baker and Carr or a case like the Virginia case to say that a majority of the people like to discriminate grossly against those who live in Arlington County or the City of Norfolk plainly won't justify it, nor would it justify such a (Inaudible).","start":1113.85,"stop":1140.075,"duration":26.23},{"text":"And our second reason is that a majority vote to approve a particular apportionment must be looked at, must be scrutinized very carefully, because what may have been done is that the people may simply have thought well, this is an awful lot

enough to overcome the very real bias pressure to decide cases which is ordinarily the court's duty, seems to me a, so nice a question that we have thought that the final outcome turned on still one

advanced by the witnesses and taken into account we think by the District Court and apparently referred to in the briefs strike us as irrelevant and impermissible in the sense that we've used that

our third rule as we have stated.","start":3612.047,"stop":3644.24,"duration":32.19},{"text":"Thus in our view the case comes down to the question, a question of degree whether the variations in per
