that in reality, they have not been following a period.","start":637.814,"stop":642.35,"duration":4.54},{"text":"And if the Court does not now find that such an affidavit and search warrant to be void then Mapp versus Ohio, Ker versus California has no meaning whatsoever so far as the states are concerned because the states that want to circumvent these particular statutes -- these particular holdings will merely enact the statutes such as Texas has and interpret it accordingly and there will be no real protection and there will be no effective right of privacy as guaranteed by the
