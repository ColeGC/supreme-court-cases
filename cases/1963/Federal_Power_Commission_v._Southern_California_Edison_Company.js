here.","start":320.096,"stop":325.067,"duration":4.97},{"text":"And Colton complains that a series of rate increases were put into effect by Edison and that the charges which were thereafter made were unlawfully collected because those increases were not filed with the Federal Power Commission.","start":325.067,"stop":345.155,"duration":20.09},{"text":"A second proponent of what I might call the federal view is the American Public Power Association which has filed a brief amicus curiae in the case and represents more than 1,200 publicly owned distribution systems in some-45 states, most of which purchased some or all of the energy which they distribute from investor-owned utilities like Edison.","start":345.155,"stop":380.065,"duration":34.91},{"text":"Since the association is not participating in the oral argument, I will pause a moment to state though without elaboration the considerations which it says give it principle concern.","start":380.065,"stop":394.968,"duration":14.9},{"text":"It argues that a case-by-case determination of the national interest in each sale and wholesale, of which there are literally thousands, would be well -- impossible.","start":394.968,"stop":410.066,"duration":15.1},{"text":"And, that it would be at least many years under the Ninth Circuit's approach, before any member of the association would know the appropriate forum in which to contest the reasonableness of a particular wholesale rate or service.","start":410.066,"stop":427.439,"duration":17.37},{"text":"It argues further that even then, constantly changing conditions within the electric system would deprive such a determination of any finality or certainty.","start":427.439,"stop":441.611,"duration":14.17},{"text":"It argues finally, that the great technological advances in the electric industry in recent years have brought us, as indeed they have to an era where we have virtually a national grid of interconnected power pools.","start":441.611,"stop":464.313,"duration":22.7},{"text":"And that in this environment, the determination of reasonable wholesale rates of a public utility will often require intimate knowledge of the very complex workings, contractual arrangements, and financial operations of the whole power pool of which the particular utility is by a part and this it suggests, makes national regulation of sales and wholesale in interstate commerce a practical imperative in many situations.","start":464.313,"stop":502.807,"duration":38.49},{"text":"The third proponent of course, of the view that this is within federal jurisdiction is the Federal Power Commission.","start":502.807,"stop":512.967,"duration":10.16},{"text":"If two is concerned with the practical implications for other cases and for its regulatory program of the Ninth Circuit's approach to this problem.","start":512.967,"stop":525.694,"duration":12.73},{"text":"Mindful of my time limitations, I shall concern myself very largely with the strictly legal and statutory basis of its claim of jurisdiction.","start":525.694,"stop":539.343,"duration":13.65},{"text":"Now, in our view of the statute we must meet two and only two very simple requirements in order to prevail.","start":539.343,"stop":548.079,"duration":8.74},{"text":"The first is the requirement that the sale of electric energy be one in interstate commerce.","start":548.079,"stop":555.59,"duration":7.51},{"text":"And the second is that it be a sale for resale or as the Act sometimes alternatively speaks, the sale and wholesale.","start":555.59,"stop":567.131,"duration":11.54},{"text":"Now, the first of these facts was assumed by the court below for purposes of its decision.","start":567.131,"stop":576.532,"duration":9.4},{"text":"The second jurisdictional fact, i.e. that Edison's sales to hol -- to Colton are sales for resale is clear and not contested.","start":576.532,"stop":590.254,"duration":13.72},{"text":"In our view Section 201 (b) of the Federal Power Act calls for no further proof and warrants no embroidery.","start":590.254,"stop":600.601,"duration":10.35},{"text":"It appears at page 43 of the Government's brief and it says in terms, that the Act shall apply to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the vital language here to the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce but shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy.","start":600.601,"stop":628.849,"duration":28.25},{"text":"Now, this “but” clause that shall not apply to other sales takes out of federal jurisdiction sales at retail, sales for example which Colton makes to the ultimate user.","start":628.849,"stop":644.872,"duration":16.02},{"text":"Our point stated in a single sentence is that for sales at wholesale in interstate commerce, the Act makes no exception.","start":644.872,"stop":657.213,"duration":12.34},{"text":"Justice Rutledge used almost those words some years ago in the Public Service of Indiana case in which he was discussing the precisely parallel provisions of the Gas Act.","start":657.213,"stop":672.032,"duration":14.82},{"text":"He said, “The line of the statute is clear and complete.","start":672.032,"stop":677.517,"duration":5.49},{"text":"It cut sharply and cleanly between the sales for resale and direct sales for consumptive use.","start":677.517,"stop":688.022,"duration":10.5},{"text":"No exceptions were made.”","start":688.022,"stop":689.818,"duration":1.8},{"text":"I'm still quoting, “No exceptions were made in either category for particular uses, quantities, or otherwise.”","start":689.818,"stop":700.325,"duration":10.51},{"text":"And, he concludes the line drawn by the statute is that one at which the decisions

201 (b) and that one must look also to Section 201 (a), which is the statutory preamble, and the states that the Act extends only to matters not subject to regulation by the states.","start":808.045,"stop":835.422,"duration":27.38},{"text":"And the suggestion that they make, is that under present day constitutional standards.","start":835.422,"stop":843.369,"duration":7.95},{"text":"The transaction here in question would not be beyond state power in the absence of a federal statute.","start":843.369,"stop":855.43,"duration":12.06},{"text":"To this argument based on 201 (a), we suggest there are two answers, both of which have indeed been made repeatedly by the Court in past decisions.","start":855.43,"stop":867.181,"duration":11.75},{"text":"The first answer is that the policy expressed in 201 (a) is relevant, as this Court put it in the Connecticut Power and Light case, in resolving any ambiguity or indefiniteness in the specific provisions of the Act but cannot, as Justice Jackson said in that case, nullify a clear and specific grant of jurisdiction.","start":867.181,"stop":895.323,"duration":28.14},{"text":"As I was indicating a moment ago to Your Honor, we think this makes particularly good sense in the construction of a statute which shows that the persons who were concerned about preserving state authority undertook to write into each operative provision the limitations upon federal authority which they contemplated.","start":895.323,"stop":922.505,"duration":27.18},{"text":"For example in Section 204, which gave the Federal Power Commission jurisdiction over the issue in securities by public utilities a matter of certainly of great concern in the 1930s, an exemption was written in, exempting public utilities which were operating in states where the issuance of securities was already subject to a state scheme of regulation.","start":922.505,"stop":951.033,"duration":28.53},{"text":"More appointed for our purposes of course, there are series of the limitations in 201 (b) itself, and our point is that the preamble or policy expressed in 201 (a) may be said to explain or illuminate those limitations but should not detract, as the Court itself has previously stated, from what is most explicitly granted to the Federal Commission.","start":951.033,"stop":979.494,"duration":28.46},{"text":"Namely jurisdiction over sales in interstate commerce and wholesale.","start":979.494,"stop":985.637,"duration":6.14},{"text":"There's a second answer.","start":985.637,"stop":988.939,"duration":3.3},{"text":"When Congress said that the Federal Power Act would provide for federal regulation only in respect of matters not subject to state regulation.","start":988.939,"stop":1003.714,"duration":14.78},{"text":"Congress was firmly of the view that the states were not able to deal with sales and wholesale in interstate commerce.","start":1003.714,"stop":1015.829,"duration":12.11},{"text":"That indeed was the plain teaching of all of the cases which this Court had decided prior to 1935, and Congress, as we view the history, said, in effect, “Very well.","start":1015.829,"stop":1030.13,"duration":14.3},{"text":"We don't want a no man's land in this field of utility regulation.","start":1030.13,"stop":1036.757,"duration":6.63},{"text":"We shall therefore, reserve to the states what the Supreme Court has said the states may do.","start":1036.757,"stop":1046.895,"duration":10.14},{"text":"And then we shall command the Federal Commission which we are creating to do what else remains to be done.","start":1046.895,"stop":1056.176,"duration":9.28},{"text":"We shall draw a plain line based upon the existing decisions and invest the federal arm with authority to act within its assigned area.”","start":1056.176,"stop":1067.669,"duration":11.49},{"text":"That perhaps they should say, that this point something about these pre-1935 cases where they of course illuminated the history about the Power Act, Part II, and of the Gas Act which was enacted a few years later.","start":1067.669,"stop":1083.346,"duration":15.68},{"text":"Now, there are two main groups of cases prior to 1935.","start":1083.346,"stop":1089.266,"duration":5.92},{"text":"One group typified by the Pennsylvania Gas case which this Court decided in 1919 and by the East Ohio Tax Commission case in 1931 involved the question whether gas all or part of which should come from out-of-state could be subjected to rate regulation or to local taxation at the point where it was sold to retail customers.","start":1089.266,"stop":1121.964,"duration":32.7},{"text":"And the Court answered to that question, \"Yes.\"","start":1121.964,"stop":1126.823,"duration":4.86},{"text":"It did so over the years on two theories, perhaps, not all together consistent theories.","start":1126.823,"stop":1134.413,"duration":7.59},{"text":"The first theory found in the Pennsylvania case was that the commerce continues to be interstate.","start":1134.413,"stop":1142.388,"duration":7.97},{"text":"The commerce and the gas right down to the burner tips where it's used by the ultimate consumer.","start":1142.388,"stop":1149.609,"duration":7.22},{"text":"But nonetheless, the state may regulate the sale at retail in the absence of federal preemption because it is not a matter of substantially local concern.","start":1149.609,"stop":1163.601,"duration":13.99},{"text":"The other theory which was elaborated in the East Ohio Tax Commission case was that there's a break in the interstate commerce at the point where the gas is greatly reduced in pressure to be carried through the mains of the city streets.","start":1163.601,"stop":1184.243,"duration":20.64},{"text":"And that therefore, the sale at retail by a distributor is in intrastate commerce coming after that reduction and pressure.","start":1184.243,"stop":1194.267,"duration":10.02},{"text":"Both theories, however, led to the conclusion that the state could deal with the sales at retail.","start":1194.267,"stop":1202.038,"duration":7.77},{"text":"There was another group of cases, a long line of them, involving efforts by the states to deal with sales of out-of-state or of mixed energy made to distribution companies as distinguished from ultimate consumers, in other words, sales at wholesale.","start":1202.038,"stop":1222.947,"duration":20.91},{"text":"In those cases of which the Kansas Gas case and the Attleboro case are landmark examples.","start":1222.947,"stop":1233.886,"duration":10.94},{"text":"The Court concluded and without any exception that sales at wholesale in interstate commerce could not be regulated either by the state in which the energy originated or in the receiving state because that would be a forbidden burden upon interstate commerce.","start":1233.886,"stop":1256.863,"duration":22.98},{"text":"Now, these groups of cases are the cases that Justice Rutledge was talking about when he said, in the excerpt that I quoted earlier, that Congress drew a short line admitting of no exceptions between sales in interstate commerce at wholesale and sales at retail, and that the line drawn was the one at which the decisions had arrived before that Part II of the Power Act was passed.","start":1256.863,"stop":1290.58,"duration":33.72},{"text":"Let me move forward if I may, from the pre-statutory cases to the decisions which followed, decisions in which this Court defined again and again the jurisdictional line.","start":1290.58,"stop":1308.654,"duration":18.07},{"text":"The first important one from our -- for our purposes is Illinois Gas against Central Illinois in 1942.","start":1308.654,"stop":1320.864,"duration":12.21},{"text":"Now, the Illinois Gas Company was a pipeline operating wholly within Illinois, comparable in its function to Edison, but purchasing out-of-state gas from its parent Panhandle, and the question in that case was whether the Illinois Commission could order Illinois Gas to interconnect with a distribution company in a city in Illinois or whether that power rested solely with the Federal Commission.","start":1320.864,"stop":1359.45,"duration":38.59},{"text":"This is a precisely analogous question because the question of jurisdiction over the extension of facilities turns on precisely the same considerations as jurisdiction over the rates of natural gas or -- companies or of electric utilities.","start":1359.45,"stop":1378.425,"duration":18.97},{"text":"The opinion of Chief Justice Stone points out at some length that before the enactment of the power in Gas Acts there had been litigation as to the limits upon state authority.","start":1378.425,"stop":1394.229,"duration":15.8},{"text":"He points to the two lines of cases to which I've referred, the one which suggested that
