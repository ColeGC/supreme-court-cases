1959.","start":336.14,"stop":364.412,"duration":28.27},{"text":"The parts of Section 8 (b)(4) that we're concerned with have always dealt with secondary

Taft-Hartley version is set forth in roman type and you'll notice the gist of those parts that we're concerned with “where making it an unfair labor practice for a Union to induce,” on page 2, “or

now.","start":487.646,"stop":500.877,"duration":13.23},{"text":"One of the complaints was that the requirement of inducing or encouraging the employees to engage in a strike against the secondary employee meant that the Union could go to the secondary employer and say “we will call a strike of your employees or we will do various other things causing trouble for you,” and that wouldn't be an unfair labor practice.","start":500.877,"stop":525.693,"duration":24.82},{"text":"The unfair labor practice wouldn't come about until there was some inducement of the

relief.","start":537.063,"stop":548.281,"duration":11.22},{"text":"It also meant, in terms of the interest of the primary employer, that the secondary employer, not having much interest in this, threatened with trouble, the full impact of which he knew nothing about, it might be serious, it might be trivial.","start":548.281,"stop":562.056,"duration":13.78},{"text":"The easy thing for him to do, often, would be to cutoff dealing with the primary employer.","start":562.056,"stop":567.332,"duration":5.28},{"text":"And, both those things, the critics from one side, under the Taft-Hartley Act, said we're undesirable.","start":567.332,"stop":576.519,"duration":9.19},{"text":"And, their solution was to put in the language that now appears on page 2 in italics, after a little roman two, “so as to make it an unfair labor practice for the labor organization for little two to threatened, coerce, or restrain any person,” and that refers to the secondary employer, as a matter of grammar

others.","start":612.8,"stop":618.813,"duration":6.01},{"text":"One objection that was raised recalled the experience of labor unions in going to secondary employers, and it's saying to them, “look,

Court.","start":12.689,"stop":16.329,"duration":3.64},{"text":"Yesterday, I pointed out that this case and the Servette case to follow focused upon the words that appear in our comparative print of the statute on page 2, just below the middle of that page, “making it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce for the purpose where an objective is to induce him to stop dealing with some other person to induce the -- to coerce the primary employ -- the secondary employer for the purpose of requiring him to stop doing business with the primary employer.”","start":16.329,"stop":62.036,"duration":45.71},{"text":"Those words were added to the statute in 1959, and I've pointed out that one of the reasons for adding them was in order to move the protection for both the primary and secondary employer back from where it had been under the original Act where there could -- was no unfair labor practice and could be no protection until there had been inducement to the secondary employer's distraint back to the points of threats before any harm had actually eventuated, but it was made quite clear in the course of the debate that this was not intended to reach request to the secondary employer or persuasion of the secondary employer voluntarily to stop doing business with the primary employer.","start":62.036,"stop":109.223,"duration":47.19},{"text":"These words were put into the statute after the bill had left the Senate, after the bill had left the House Labor Committee, and on the Floor of the House.","start":109.223,"stop":121.82,"duration":12.6},{"text":"When they were put in by the House, a second controversy arose, which is also of the essence and in some respects closer to these two cases.","start":121.82,"stop":132.569,"duration":10.75},{"text":"And, that had to do with the bearing of the words “on efforts to induce consumers not to buy a product from a

employer.”","start":132.569,"stop":155.94,"duration":23.37},{"text":"Under the Taft-Hartley version of Section 8 (b)(4), it was all together clear that that conduct was not

illustration of a strike against the Coors Brewery up in Colorado.","start":164.738,"stop":179.222,"duration":14.48},{"text":"And, they pointed out that under the Taft-Hartley version, while it would be an unfair labor practice to induce the employees of packing stores or bars and taverns not to handle Coors beer, or to go on strike, or to induce the truck drivers not to deliver it to the taverns or packing stores, that it would have been permissible under the earlier statute to persuade the public not to buy that product in the packing stores or taverns.","start":179.222,"stop":209.419,"duration":30.2},{"text":"And, that this language “threaten, coerce, or restrain any person” would cutoff what they described is one of the fundamental rights
