there were 13 alleged discriminations set forth in the complaint ranging from the rejection of allegedly superior offers by Viking in favor of inferior offers by competitors to the failure to screen

all of his specifications of discriminations and grievances, the word \"splits\" never passed his lips.","start":73.626,"stop":83.196,"duration":9.57},{"text":"Any of the theories that we now have about -- that are now presented about this, of course, could not be cross-examined because they were never even presented.","start":83.196,"stop":91.996,"duration":8.8},{"text":"Instead, for 42 days, 7700 pages of the record, we were involved in the trial in which on a blackboard, we compare the chief charge that superior offers by Viking were rejected in favor of inferior offers and that became a shambles, the plaintiff out of his own mouth, repeatedly said, \"I take it back.","start":91.996,"stop":115.544,"duration":23.55},{"text":"Now that I see that I'm wrong, cross it off\", and we crossed off picture after picture.","start":115.544,"stop":120.834,"duration":5.29},{"text":"And all of his other alleged discriminations had the same fate and there was nothing left since there was not even

trial.","start":130.19,"stop":135.015,"duration":4.82},{"text":"We went to the Court of Appeals.","start":135.015,"stop":137.371,"duration":2.36},{"text":"There, for the first time, although the chief time was taken up on all these alleged discriminations, reviewing them, splits escape their anonymity and were mentioned at least as one of the ways of discrimination from which circumstantial evidence of conspiracy could be spelled out.","start":137.371,"stop":155.945,"duration":18.57},{"text":"Judge Biggs allowed a full day of oral argument, requested cross indexes so that the Court could

distributors' conduct first separately.","start":155.945,"stop":180.692,"duration":24.75},{"text":"Then referring to the Continental Ore doctrine by name and saying we now look upon the entire matter

that splits were illegal, all the arguments made in this Court.","start":199.456,"stop":206.387,"duration":6.93},{"text":"And they found that it was not unlawful, that splits were not unlawful and that the evidence showed no injury to the plaintiff therefrom.","start":206.387,"stop":215.254,"duration":8.87},{"text":"Then came the petition of certiorari to this Court and for the first time that was contented that the splits are the conspiracy.","start":215.254,"stop":223.299,"duration":8.05},{"text":"That all the other discriminations flow from it, the phrase used is syllogistically.And splits emerged as the doctrine of law upon which, indeed, if they had believed in it, they could have moved for summary judgment as a question of law instead of trying the case for 42 days without mentioning it.","start":223.299,"stop":242.462,"duration":19.16},{"text":"And the company in this concoction in this Court are contrived theories in the brief of submarkets which do not exist in the realistic economic life of this industry, alleged monopolization of submarkets, these non-existent submarkets, monopoly becomes measured by computing theatre seats and incidentally, manipulated so that they multiply the defendants' exhibitor seats by three and divide the plaintiff's seats by three on the theory that the Viking had to enter three submarkets therefore one-third of the seats were competing in each market.","start":242.462,"stop":278.257,"duration":35.8},{"text":"The theory that by storing up financial resources during the split, the defendant exhibitors were able to give premium offers against the Viking and other semantic and mathematical legit domain about syllogistic inevitability.","start":278.257,"stop":295.143,"duration":16.89},{"text":"And all these, Your Honor, in this Court, without any record to support it, dismembered from all the evidence, floating in midair, detached from anything in the record.","start":295.143,"stop":306.618,"duration":11.48},{"text":"Now, when one concocts such a verba, there are 1000 facts which rise to be dealt with.","start":306.618,"stop":313.742,"duration":7.12},{"text":"The new theory that there's -- this is a monopoly case of the submarket runs into the fact that there was an expressed concession cited in page 5 of our brief, that this case does not involve monopoly and no charge of monopoly is made.","start":313.742,"stop":327.74,"duration":14},{"text":"That position wasn't even changed in the Court of Appeals.","start":327.74,"stop":331.224,"duration":3.48},{"text":"Section 2, the monopoly statute wasn't even cited among the statutes involved in the Court of Appeals.","start":331.224,"stop":337.983,"duration":6.76},{"text":"And therefore, the Court of Appeals in its opinion necessarily treated with this simply as a conspiracy case.","start":337.983,"stop":344.287,"duration":6.3},{"text":"The new theory that the defendants through splits, the defendant exhibitors were able to store up finances to make premium office, subsequently runs into the fact that in the trial, the plaintiff's entire burden was to demonstrate that it was the plaintiff that made the premium bids and that they were rejected in favor of non-premium bids, lower bids or offers by his competitors.","start":344.287,"stop":369.419,"duration":25.13},{"text":"And the new theory that seats are the determining factor in this so-called submarket of monopoly runs into the theory that the plaintiff's insisted at the other end of the spectrum, in the court below, that seats aren't even a factor in determining an evaluation of an offer or a bid.","start":369.419,"stop":387.679,"duration":18.26},{"text":"He was asked, supposed a 600 seat theatre competed against Radio City 6000 seats, would the difference in seats be a factor?","start":387.679,"stop":396.128,"duration":8.45},{"text":"His answer was, \"No, sir.\"","start":396.128,"stop":399.31,"duration":3.18},{"text":"And in the reply brief, after being faced with these references to the self-stultification of the plaintiff, there is no answer to these contentions.","start":399.31,"stop":410.266,"duration":10.96},{"text":"Now, what are splits and what are their function?","start":410.266,"stop":414.577,"duration":4.31},{"text":"Due to television impact upon the industry, there was an alarming shrinkage of the number of theatres in this country and also an alarming shortage and reduction of motion pictures.","start":414.577,"stop":426.512,"duration":11.94},{"text":"And so there was a shortage of products.","start":426.512,"stop":429.66,"duration":3.15},{"text":"And as this Court had occasions, to Mr. Justice Douglas, to say that we will not compel bidding, competitive bidding, when the matter came before you, there was a search for alternative methods, than simply competitive biding.","start":429.66,"stop":444.222,"duration":14.56},{"text":"And one of the alternatives that grew up in the nation and as the reason for the amicus curiae brief filed by 12,500 theaters in this country opposing the Viking's position, one of the alternative methods was the splitting of product.","start":444.222,"stop":461.353,"duration":17.13},{"text":"And as in Philadelphia when there are 12 first-run theatres and only eight companies to feed the 12 mouths, there is a problem of whether these theatres can exist and this -- this is one of the outlets, the relief and ameliorated -- amelioratory process to say particularly the little theatres, the grassroots splitters throughout the country that want the splitting arrangements.","start":461.353,"stop":483.62,"duration":22.27},{"text":"Now, how does the split operate?","start":483.62,"stop":485.985,"duration":2.37},{"text":"I'm afraid there is some misunderstanding from the pre -- presentation.","start":485.985,"stop":490.978,"duration":4.99},{"text":"Very rarely, indeed, the record shows never does the distributor put all of these pictures on a split.","start":490.978,"stop":497.497,"duration":6.52},{"text":"Apparently, he has some special productions and he doesn't wish to put them on, he has a special sales policy.","start":497.497,"stop":506.054,"duration":8.56},{"text":"The two exhibitors or there may be more come to the distributor and say, \"Would you mind if we didn't compete against each other on your product coming out for the next three months?\" And they make a list of pictures.","start":506.054,"stop":518.77,"duration":12.72},{"text":"No terms, no financial terms, just names.","start":518.77,"stop":522.474,"duration":3.7},{"text":"And presumably, they divide this list to have parody between them.","start":522.474,"stop":525.894,"duration":3.42},{"text":"And the distributor is asked to make the sacrifice of consenting to eliminate the competition between these two for those particular pictures.","start":525.894,"stop":534.456,"duration":8.56},{"text":"The arrangement is always terminable at will.","start":534.456,"stop":538.357,"duration":3.9},{"text":"The distributor makes no commitment to the exhibitor that he will receive the pictures on the split, not at all.","start":538.357,"stop":544.771,"duration":6.41},{"text":"The evidence is conclusive and there's no contradiction of it that the split is always subject to the distributors having the right as he must insist to recoup his money to offer that picture on the split to all other exhibitors in the territory.","start":544.771,"stop":559.044,"duration":14.27},{"text":"The exhibitor makes no commitment that he'll buy that picture on the split, neither does he.","start":559.044,"stop":563.546,"duration":4.5},{"text":"Indeed, the exhibitor very often ignores the picture on his own split, not only because it may not turn out to be attractive to him for practical reasons he may not have planned that.","start":563.546,"stop":575.161,"duration":11.61},{"text":"But above all, the finding of the Court of Appeals and the uniform testimony without contradiction was that no competitor in the territory was affected by pictures being put on the split.","start":575.161,"stop":588.007,"duration":12.85},{"text":"They all had an opportunity to negotiate a bid for those pictures.","start":588.007,"stop":592.318,"duration":4.31},{"text":"And indeed, without wishing to trespass on my colleague who will develop this fact, just one statistical fact, I leave the rest to him.","start":592.318,"stop":600.949,"duration":8.63},{"text":"The Viking was interested in 87 pictures.","start":600.949,"stop":604.267,"duration":3.32},{"text":"Of these 48 were on splits.","start":604.267,"stop":607.313,"duration":3.05},{"text":"The Viking got 17 of these 48 pictures from the split, proof enough that the splits didn't affect it.","start":607.313,"stop":615.142,"duration":7.83},{"text":"And indeed as Mr. Wolf will demonstrate, Stanley-Warner and Goldman got less pictures on this split than the Viking did of those that the
