and then got involved in bankruptcy but it ends up here as a matter involving interest.","start":30.582,"stop":48.075,"duration":17.49},{"text":"The issue is whether or not the Government on a tax deficiency can collect interest after a petition in bankruptcy is filed from the debtor's assets.","start":48.075,"stop":67.016,"duration":18.94},{"text":"This is not a case in which the Government seeks interest on a tax deficiency from the bankruptcy estate.","start":67.016,"stop":77.474,"duration":10.46},{"text":"The Government concedes that it cannot do that because this Court, in City of New York versus Saper, has held that the Government may not collect interest on a tax deficiency accruing after bankruptcy out of the bankruptcy estate.","start":77.474,"stop":104.794,"duration":27.32},{"text":"The case arose in this manner.","start":104.794,"stop":110.639,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Bruning, the petitioner, was doing business as Bruning Construction Company.","start":110.639,"stop":117.386,"duration":6.75},{"text":"During the fourth quarter of 1951, he became in arrears in withholding tax and social security tax in the approximate amount of $4000.","start":117.386,"stop":131.582,"duration":14.2},{"text":"A delinquent tax return was filed and the Government assessed the tax in 1952.","start":131.582,"stop":141.29,"duration":9.71},{"text":"It issued a notice and demand in a formal manner in 1952.","start":141.29,"stop":148.17,"duration":6.88},{"text":"In June of 1953, Bruning filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy.","start":148.17,"stop":159.917,"duration":11.75},{"text":"Three years later, there were assets in the amount of $700 applied to this tax deficiency.","start":159.917,"stop":171.424,"duration":11.51},{"text":"There was no interest applied because the Saper case, decided by this Court, was in effect at that time.","start":171.424,"stop":182.529,"duration":11.1},{"text":"Since, as I shall explain later, taxes have a priority, the $700 applied to the tax deficiency reduced that deficiency but the general creditors received no dividend.","start":182.529,"stop":203.496,"duration":20.97},{"text":"Bruning, on his 1953 and 1954 income tax returns had overpaid his tax.","start":203.496,"stop":212.624,"duration":9.13},{"text":"He had overpaid his tax on both returns.","start":212.624,"stop":217.371,"duration":4.75},{"text":"And he was entitled to a refund of about $3700.","start":217.371,"stop":224.049,"duration":6.68},{"text":"He filed the claim and the claim was allowed.","start":224.049,"stop":230.029,"duration":5.98},{"text":"The Government then applied this $3700 refund against the withholding taxes and social security taxes that were owed for the fourth quarter of 1951.","start":230.029,"stop":248.445,"duration":18.42},{"text":"There was no notice and demand filed.","start":248.445,"stop":253.228,"duration":4.78},{"text":"The Government simply applied the money.","start":253.228,"stop":257.176,"duration":3.95},{"text":"When the Government did that, it took $795 and applied it to interest on the $3700 deficiency accruing from the date of the bankruptcy in 1953 until the payment or the credit in 1958.","start":257.176,"stop":280.924,"duration":23.75},{"text":"We do not have in question today interest on prebankruptcy tax deficiency.","start":280.924,"stop":290.464,"duration":9.54},{"text":"Both the taxpayer, petitioner, and the Government concede that the Government is entitled to interest on a tax deficiency up to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.","start":290.464,"stop":308.507,"duration":18.04},{"text":"Now, I want to point out at this time the anomalous situation that the taxpayer is in.","start":308.507,"stop":319.553,"duration":11.05},{"text":"Suppose the tax deficiency is a $100,000 and that is not too unusual in his bankruptcy cases.","start":319.553,"stop":327.643,"duration":8.09},{"text":"In the Mighell case, which is in conflict with the Bruning case below, the tax deficiency was $78,000.","start":327.643,"stop":337.073,"duration":9.43},{"text":"But if the tax is $100,000, in three years at 6% interest, the interest would be $18,000.","start":337.073,"stop":348.502,"duration":11.43},{"text":"Now, the Government, because of its priority, collects the $100,000 but if the payment -- and there's $18,000 available for payment, it cannot be used.","start":348.502,"stop":365.478,"duration":16.98},{"text":"That $18,000 is available to general creditors but the Government can't take it up and use it for interest because this Court decided in the Saper case that it could not be done.","start":365.478,"stop":379.58,"duration":14.1},{"text":"So the taxpayer has no way of wiping out this $18,000 in interest on the tax deficiency and the Government can and will pursue that as long as he lives.","start":379.58,"stop":394.027,"duration":14.45},{"text":"They will pursue it and try to take it out of his after bankruptcy acquired assets.","start":394.027,"stop":402.565,"duration":8.54},{"text":"Now, the Government is using two inconsistent arguments in trying to get at these after acquired assets of the debtor.","start":402.565,"stop":419.166,"duration":16.6},{"text":"Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that taxes are not discharge -- that taxes are not dischargeable.","start":419.166,"stop":437.385,"duration":18.22},{"text":"They are provable debts but they are not dischargeable debts.","start":437.385,"stop":445.021,"duration":7.64},{"text":"As distinguished from a general creditor who has a provable debt but to the extent that it is not paid out of -- out of the assets of the bankruptcy estate, it is wiped out.","start":445.021,"stop":459.459,"duration":14.44},{"text":"The rest of it is discharged.","start":459.459,"stop":461.678,"duration":2.22},{"text":"Not so with taxes because under the Bankruptcy Code, as I said before, taxes are specifically accepted from discharge.","start":461.678,"stop":476.097,"duration":14.42},{"text":"Now, we have another part of the Bankruptcy Code which comes into play, as I stated before, the Government took $700 out of the bankrupt's assets to pay the deficiency.","start":476.097,"stop":493.947,"duration":17.85},{"text":"That was because the Government, under Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Code, has priority.","start":493.947,"stop":502.973,"duration":9.03},{"text":"It gets paid before the general creditors get paid.","start":502.973,"stop":508.609,"duration":5.64},{"text":"Now, that brings to the inconsistency -- that brings us to the inconsistency I mentioned before.","start":508.609,"stop":516.491,"duration":7.88},{"text":"The Government, in trying to save its interest, argues first that it's not approvable debt dischargeable under Section 17 because it says, the interest has not become due at any time during the proceeding.","start":516.491,"stop":538.016,"duration":21.52},{"text":"And there's no way of estimating whether it ever will be owing or in what amounts.","start":538.016,"stop":544.216,"duration":6.2},{"text":"But then, it later argues, quoting from page 19 of the Government brief, \"To the extent that interest is provable on a tax liability, it is provable as part of a single provable debt for taxes\".","start":544.216,"stop":564.227,"duration":20.01},{"text":"But provable debts for taxes are specifically accepted from discharge by Section 17.","start":564.227,"stop":569.881,"duration":5.65},{"text":"This is the reason prepetition interest is concededly not discharged in the present case.","start":569.881,"stop":575.617,"duration":5.74},{"text":"The same rationale would -- would control post-petition interest if it too were provable.","start":575.617,"stop":582.869,"duration":7.25},{"text":"Now, why does the Government argue this?","start":582.869,"stop":586.849,"duration":3.98},{"text":"First, it says interest is not taxes and then it says interest is taxes.","start":586.849,"stop":592.822,"duration":5.97},{"text":"Why does it say interest is taxes?","start":592.822,"stop":595.95,"duration":3.13},{"text":"Because if it is taxes, then it is not dischargeable, and there's considerable argument here to the effect that interest is collected like taxes, it's treated like taxes, it's assimilated in the tax but the fact is that interest is not tax, it's never has been and never will be.","start":595.95,"stop":619.147,"duration":23.2},{"text":"And as far as being determinable, at any time, you just take your 6% and apply it to the principle and there you have it.","start":619.147,"stop":628.833,"duration":9.69},{"text":"But the -- the principle thing here is that under the decision of the Saper case, we believe that this issue was really decided.","start":628.833,"stop":648.259,"duration":19.43},{"text":"The broad language of the case, if you'll permit me to read it because I believe it's important, covers this case.","start":648.259,"stop":658.406,"duration":10.15},{"text":"The Court stated, and this, Mr. Justice Jackson wrote the opinion, more than 40 years ago.","start":658.406,"stop":664.67,"duration":6.26},{"text":"Mr. Justice Holmes wrote for the Court that the rules stopping interest at bankruptcy had been -- been followed for more than a century and a half.","start":664.67,"stop":672.814,"duration":8.14},{"text":"He said the rule was not a matter of legislative command or statutory construction but rather a fundamental principle of the English bankruptcy system that we copied, citing Sexton versus Dreyfus which was -- which was -- the opinion of which was written by Mr. Justice Holmes.","start":672.814,"stop":697.171,"duration":24.36},{"text":"Now, there is no logical reason for cutting off interest as far as the bankruptcy estate is concerned and then taking it up as far as the debtor's assets are concerned.","start":697.171,"stop":717.018,"duration":19.85},{"text":"The Government already has two advantages.","start":717.018,"stop":720.012,"duration":2.99},{"text":"It has a priority and it has approvable debt that is not dischargeable.","start":720.012,"stop":725.983,"duration":5.97},{"text":"Now, the Government seeks a third advantage.","start":725.983,"stop":729.241,"duration":3.26},{"text":"It wants to pursue the after bankruptcy acquired assets of a debtor and pick up the interest at that point which, if it should have been paid to the Government, ought to come out of the bankruptcy assets.","start":729.241,"stop":747.768,"duration":18.53}]},{"speakerName":"Arthur J.
