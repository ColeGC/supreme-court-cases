simple.","start":31.168,"stop":36.822,"duration":5.65},{"text":"Two of the appellees, Pennsalt and Olin Mathieson, each a large well equipped firm, actively interested in entering an important market on its own, although not fully committed to the venture, agreed to combine forces and to enter the market jointly, thereby, foreclosing any possibility of competition between the two in that market, either immediately or sometime in the longer run in the future.","start":36.822,"stop":76.023,"duration":39.2},{"text":"The ultimate question here is whether that combination violated, which was

previously.","start":93.47,"stop":102.36,"duration":8.89},{"text":"The District Court prepared a careful and independent-minded opinion, which not only establishes the facts, but which I think offers the best avenue for coming to grips with the legal issues in the case.","start":102.36,"stop":121.142,"duration":18.78},{"text":"The Court found that in the southeastern United States, there's an important market for sodium hydrochloride, a chemical that is used in the pulp and paper industry for the purposes of bleaching.","start":121.142,"stop":137.644,"duration":16.5},{"text":"Sodium hydro

Mississippi, which sold 49% of the market, American Potash, also, was a plant in Mississippi, which sold 41% and Pennsalt, which sold just under 9%.","start":158.31,"stop":174.854,"duration":16.54},{"text":"I should say that Pennsalt's ability to compete in the market with its existing plants was distinctly limited by the fact that the only plant in existence was way out on the west coast, so that for all practical purposes, you had only two suppliers.","start":174.854,"stop":193.257,"duration":18.4},{"text":"During the 1950s, the southeastern market for sodium hydrochloride became more and more attractive to new investors.","start":193.257,"stop":203.762,"duration":10.5},{"text":"Olin Mathieson and Pennsalt, each gave long and careful consideration to building its own sodium hydrochloride plant in the southeast.","start":203.762,"stop":214.818,"duration":11.06},{"text":"The District Court expressly found on page 1574, that's in volume 2 of the record, that Pennsalt and Olin, right at the top of the page, \"Each had had extensive background in sodium chloride,\" skipping, \"That a suitable location for a plant was available to each company and then, in short, that Pennsalt and Olin, each possessed the resources and general capability needed to build its own plant in the southeast and to compete with Hooker and Am-Pot, American Potash, in that market.","start":214.818,"stop":256.413,"duration":41.6},{"text":"\"The Court also discussed the deliberations of each individual management about individual entry and concluded back on page 1573, at the bottom of the text and above the footnote, the possibility of individual entry into the southeastern market had not been completely rejected by either Pennsalt or Olin before they decided upon the joint venture.","start":256.413,"stop":286.434,"duration":30.02},{"text":"I ought to pause here to call attention to page 16 of the appellees' brief where they quote an excerpt from the testimony of Olin's president intended to indicate that Olin had not -- had decided not to build the plant on its own even if there were no joint venture.","start":286.434,"stop":310.151,"duration":23.72},{"text":"Now, that argument was made to the District Court and the District Court squarely rejected it when it found that the possibility of individual entry had not been completely rejected by either before they decide it upon the joint venture.","start":310.151,"stop":327.051,"duration":16.9},{"text":"Furthermore, that finding, as a footnote to the opinion, immediately below the quotation, the opinion shows, was based upon the statement of Olin's own president in his deposition which was introduced in evidence.","start":327.051,"stop":343.179,"duration":16.13},{"text":"The reference unhappily is not there and we neglected to print the deposition but, of course, it's here in the

as quoted, \"That the question had never reached the point of final decision\".","start":351.141,"stop":370.688,"duration":19.55},{"text":"Furthermore, the testimony quoted by counsel, as they also overlook, was qualified on cross-examination and it was substantially inconsistent with testimony by one of Olin's vice president, both in his deposition and also as given at the trial.","start":370.688,"stop":390.996,"duration":20.31},{"text":"So that, I think that the findings so amply supportive were certainly entitled to take it as a fact in this Court that Olin, like Pennsalt, had not turned its back on the possibility of individual entry.","start":390.996,"stop":407.164,"duration":16.17},{"text":"I now come to the crux of the matter, both in the opinion and in our analysis of the case.","start":407.164,"stop":417.122,"duration":9.96},{"text":"On page 1575, after finding at the start of the first full paragraph, that Olin and Pennsalt, each had the capability of building a plant and competing individually.","start":417.122,"stop":431.708,"duration":14.59},{"text":"The District Court ruled \"that those facts were important,\"skipping a few lines,

formed.","start":431.708,"stop":453.209,"duration":21.5},{"text":"Only in this event\", the Court said \"would potential competition between the two companies have been foreclosed by the joint venture.","start":453.209,"stop":462.625,"duration":9.42},{"text":"\" He then went on to say that there was no evidence to support a finding that there was a probability that both companies would've simultaneously entered the bargain and he held that if we fail to prove that, we were entitled to judgment only if we showed that Penn-Olin, the subsidiary combination, would be a less effective competitor than Olin alone or Pennsalt alone.","start":462.625,"stop":490.259,"duration":27.63},{"text":"Well, of course, we made no such claim, could make no such claim and the District Court, thereupon, entered judgment for the defendants and the complaint was dismissed.","start":490.259,"stop":504.129,"duration":13.87},{"text":"Now, our first contention in this Court is that the District Court erred in holding that the United States, in order to prove a violation of Section 7, was required to demonstrate a probability that both Olin and Pennsalt would've shortly built hydrochloride markets -- hydrochloride plants in the absence of Penn-Olin.","start":504.129,"stop":528.574,"duration":24.44},{"text":"Our view is that if one company would've entered the market and the other would've remained in the wings as a potential competitor available to enter, if the commercial opportunities became sufficiently attractive, then the foreclosure of that future potential competition by the combination rendered it one which may substantially lessen competition within the meaning of Section 7.","start":528.574,"stop":556.569,"duration":28},{"text":"The defect in the reasoning of the District Court, it seems to us, is that it took much too short-range of view of the matter and it, therefore, completely overlooked the benefit to the market of having one firm in it and an additional strong firm fully capable of entering the market, sitting on the sidelines, able to become a supplier if the price situation should warrant, if demand should outrun supply or if there were opportunities for technical innovation or other reasons to go in.","start":556.569,"stop":593.963,"duration":37.39},{"text":"There's no reason to suppose, of course, that Penn-Olin would be any weaker than either of the individual firms and indeed, there's no reason to suppose that it was stronger than either of the individual firms.","start":593.963,"stop":607.258,"duration":13.3},{"text":"If one looked only at the immediate future and supposed that there would be only one entering, then it wouldn't matter at all whether it was Penn-Olin that went in, Olin went in or the third one went in, but the difference is that you can't take so short-range of view.","start":607.258,"stop":627.616,"duration":20.36},{"text":"The Clayton Act, like businessmen, is concerned with projecting ahead, 5, 10, 15 years of prophylactic measure and the difference between -- if Olin went in alone, you would've still had Pennsalt there.","start":627.616,"stop":645.839,"duration":18.22},{"text":"If Pennsalt went in alone, you would've still had Olin there, but when you have Penn-Olin go in, you have neither available as a prospective future entry.","start":645.839,"stop":660.822,"duration":14.98},{"text":"And the existence, as I need hardly argue, of a prospective future entry, especially where there is a concentration of economic power as there was in this market, only two present firms, it's only new -- one new and apparently going in, is extremely important because it fixes a limit, not as good as existing competitors but nevertheless, some limit upon the market power, the monopoly or oligopolistic power of those who are present.","start":660.822,"stop":698.077,"duration":37.25}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"(Inaudible)","start":698.077,"stop":703.891,"duration":5.81}]},{"speakerName":"Archibald
