precedent.","start":811.503,"stop":815.86,"duration":4.36},{"text":"He said that it was non-arbitrable in his view, because of the simple fact that in Utica, there is a legally certified union with the exclusive right to represent all production and maintenance of employees of the Utica plant.","start":815.86,"stop":831.33,"duration":15.47},{"text":"He said that any reasonable person would have

proper arena.","start":863.446,"stop":879.799,"duration":16.35},{"text":"So he just made an arbitrability determination, and he said that his view as matter of logic and common sense, this was not an arbitrable grievance.","start":879.799,"stop":887.78,"duration":7.98},{"text":"Now he is not bound by 301.","start":887.78,"stop":891.608,"duration":3.83},{"text":"I don't have significant values, but

courts.","start":891.608,"stop":903.835,"duration":12.23},{"text":"It shouldn't make any difference who determines arbitrability.","start":903.835,"stop":909.768,"duration":5.93},{"text":"If you look
