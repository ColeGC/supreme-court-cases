monopoly.","start":50.418,"stop":55.119,"duration":4.7},{"text":"The combination patent here in suit is entitled convertible automobile folding top with automatic seal at the rear quarter.","start":55.119,"stop":63.686,"duration":8.57},{"text":"Now, the combination patent in suit here covers a combination of elements which function together to affect a water-tight seal at the rear quarter of the automobile.","start":63.686,"stop":75.571,"duration":11.88},{"text":"One of the elements in the patented combination is the unpatented fabric element.","start":75.571,"stop":80.666,"duration":5.09},{"text":"There is no separate claim to the fabric and, therefore, the fabric element is itself not patented.","start":80.666,"stop":86.971,"duration":6.31},{"text":"Ford and General Motors cars for the years in the early 1950s embodied the patented combination as original equipment.","start":86.971,"stop":96.991,"duration":10.02},{"text":"The petitioners make, sell, and on occasion install only replacements for the unpatented fabric element of the patented combination.","start":96.991,"stop":107.016,"duration":10.03},{"text":"As a result of this activity, respondent charged petitioners with infringement and contributory infringement.","start":107.016,"stop":114.816,"duration":7.8},{"text":"The District Court, the first time around, found both infringement and contributory infringement arising from the manufacture, installation, and sale of these unpatented replacement fabrics for both Ford and General Motors cars, and accordingly entered an interlocutory judgment.","start":114.816,"stop":132.826,"duration":18.01},{"text":"The Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment.","start":132.826,"stop":136.573,"duration":3.75},{"text":"This Court then granted certiorari and reversed.","start":136.573,"stop":141.609,"duration":5.04},{"text":"After denying respondent's petition for rehearing or any alternative, a motion for a clarification of opinion in which respondent advanced the same arguments that it had advanced in its brief on the merits and is now advancing in this hearing that it was entitled to patent monopoly over replacement fabrics for Ford cars even though it wasn't entitled to monopoly rights over replacement for General Motors cars.","start":141.609,"stop":169.672,"duration":28.06},{"text":"This Court then remanded the case directly to the Massachusetts District Court.","start":169.672,"stop":173.933,"duration":4.26},{"text":"The Massachusetts District Court, first, entered final judgment, dismissing the complaint with cause to petitioners and dismissing petitioners' counter claim without cause.","start":173.933,"stop":187.363,"duration":13.43},{"text":"At the same time, it held the patent valid.","start":187.363,"stop":190.79,"duration":3.43},{"text":"We move to amend and, accordingly, the District Court struck out the finding of validity from its final judgment and also amended the final judgment to expressly state that the dismissal of our counter claim was without prejudice.","start":190.79,"stop":207.923,"duration":17.13},{"text":"Respondent then appealed from this decision of the District Court, claiming that it was entitled to monopoly rights over the unpatented replacements for Ford cars.","start":207.923,"stop":218.315,"duration":10.39},{"text":"And, petitioners cross-appealed, claiming that the record, then before the court, required a conclusion that not only had respondent and its assignor misused the combination patent to restrain trade of non-patented replacement fabrics and was, therefore, barred for maintaining either an action for a direct or contributory infringement, but also had violated the antitrust laws.","start":218.315,"stop":246.305,"duration":27.99},{"text":"Well, the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court final judgment and reinstated that portion of its prior judgment that had been reversed by this Court dealing with replacement fabrics for Ford cars.","start":246.305,"stop":261.591,"duration":15.29},{"text":"And, they conferred patent monopoly over some unpatented replacement fabrics for Ford cars, depending upon the interpretation of a private agreement between respondent's assignor and the Ford Motor Company.","start":261.591,"stop":275.902,"duration":14.31},{"text":"In that private agreement, Ford had released -- or rather respondent's assignor had released Ford and owners of its cars from liability arising from the manufacture, use, and sale of the patented convertible automobile but expressly reserved the right and exercise the right to license the manufacture, use, and sale of the unpatented replacement fabrics.","start":275.902,"stop":303.668,"duration":27.77},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, in reviewing the decision of this Court, said that what the Court said in its opinion gave it little guidance, but what the Court did not say, it felt, meant that the Court was not deciding the question as to the unpatented fabrics for so-called “unlicensed Ford cars.”","start":303.668,"stop":326.395,"duration":22.73},{"text":"And, while the Court of Appeals did quote what this Court said was the principle and determinative question presented here, whether the owner of a combination patent comprised entirely of unpatented elements has an additional patent monopoly on the manufacture, sale, and use of the several unpatented components of the patented combination, the Court of Appeals did not quote the answer that this Court gave to that question.","start":326.395,"stop":357.217,"duration":30.82},{"text":"And, this Court answered that question by saying “no element, not itself separately patented, that constitutes one of the elements of a combination patent is entitled to patent monopoly, however essential it may be to the patented combination and no matter how difficult or costly replacement may be.”","start":357.217,"stop":378.417,"duration":21.2},{"text":"Now, it's silly to distinguish between the replacement fabrics for Ford cars and for General Motors cars because the replacement fabrics for Ford cars are just as unpatented as those for General Motors cars.","start":378.417,"stop":391.907,"duration":13.49},{"text":"And, this Court pointed out the basic fallacy in respondent's position in the prior opinion as follows, which is just as applicable today.","start":391.907,"stop":401.027,"duration":9.12},{"text":"They said the basic fallacy in respondent's position is that it requires ascribing to one element of the patented combination the status of patented invention in itself.","start":401.027,"stop":414.383,"duration":13.36},{"text":"Now, the interlocutory judgment that was reviewed and reversed previously by this Court dealt with replacement fabrics for both Ford and General Motors cars, and whatever was before the Court was finally disposed of.","start":414.383,"stop":428.44,"duration":14.06},{"text":"And, the Court of Appeals had no basis for reexamining the disposition of this case.","start":428.44,"stop":433.755,"duration":5.31},{"text":"The Court recently held so in NAACP versus Alabama in 360 U.S., and that case cited Siebel versus United States way back in 12 Peters.","start":433.755,"stop":448.239,"duration":14.48},{"text":"It is also inconsistent with the Mercoid cases to confer monopoly rights in the unpatented replacement fabrics for Ford cars.","start":448.239,"stop":459.142,"duration":10.9},{"text":"In the Mercoid cases, this Court decided that the combination patentee could not restrain trade or prevent competition in the sale of a non-patented element for original installation in a patented machine that was sold without the patentee's consent.","start":459.142,"stop":480.453,"duration":21.31},{"text":"A fortiori, the combination patentee cannot forbid the sale of a non-patented replacement fabric for a replacement installation in a patented machine that was sold with the patentee's consent.","start":480.453,"stop":494.731,"duration":14.28},{"text":"Now, respondent will say that it wasn't sold with the patentee's consent because it was only a release that was granted to the owners of the Ford cars.","start":494.731,"stop":506.871,"duration":12.14},{"text":"But, the fact is that respondent's assignor got $73,000 from the Ford Motor Company in exchange for release from all liability arising from the manufacture, use, and sale of these patented machines.","start":506.871,"stop":521.484,"duration":14.61},{"text":"It seems reasonably obvious that the respondent or its assignor could not have maintained an action for a direct infringement against the Ford car owner after it had released the owners of the Ford cars from liability and since a liability for contributory infringement is predicated upon their first being liable -- liability for a direct infringement.","start":521.484,"stop":547.844,"duration":26.36},{"text":"We do not see how respondent could possibly maintain an action for a contributory infringement.","start":547.844,"stop":555.162,"duration":7.32},{"text":"Moreover, if we accept respondent's contention in this case, we're going to be departing from a long line of patent antitrust cases in which this Court has consistently held that the patentee is forbidden from expanding the scope of this combination patent monopoly.","start":555.162,"stop":574.892,"duration":19.73},{"text":"That line of cases dates back to 1917 when this Court entered its opinion in the Motion Picture Patents case back in 243 U.S.","start":574.892,"stop":584.953,"duration":10.06},{"text":"And, only recently, in United States versus Loews, Inc., this Court restated the significance of that line of cases in the following manner.","start":584.953,"stop":595.055,"duration":10.1},{"text":"The Court said “these cases reflect a hostility to use of the statutorily granted patent monopoly to extend the patentee's economic control to unpatented products.","start":595.055,"stop":607.406,"duration":12.35},{"text":"The patentee is protected as to his invention but may not use his patent rights to exact tribute for other articles.”","start":607.406,"stop":615.138,"duration":7.73},{"text":"And, that's just exactly what respondent and its assignor have done in this case.","start":615.138,"stop":620.193,"duration":5.05},{"text":"They have expanded a pair of combination patent monopolies to restrain trade in these unpatented replacement fabrics and we say that that conduct is to be measured by the antirust laws, as this Court pointed out in the second Mercoid case, the legality of any attempt to bring unpatented goods within the protection of the patent is measured by the antirust laws, not the patent law.","start":620.193,"stop":646.93,"duration":26.74},{"text":"Now, the court below didn't say that the record didn't show an antirust law violation.","start":646.93,"stop":652.586,"duration":5.66},{"text":"The Court of Appeals said that the short answer to petitioner's claim, as appellants below seeking relief from the consequences of respondent's antitrust law violations, is that they never pleaded a cause of action under the antitrust laws.","start":652.586,"stop":670.948,"duration":18.36},{"text":"Well, I'm just going to read an excerpt from the pleading and you'll notice in the opinion of the court of -- it's pages 10-11, at the bottom of page 10, “you'll notice in the opinion of the Court of Appeals that they do not quote any portion of our pleading.”","start":670.948,"stop":685.732,"duration":14.78},{"text":"We said, in our answer in counter claim, said “Automobile Body Research Corporation,” that's respondent's assignor, “has entered into at least one licensing agreement and/or has caused others to be sublicensed under agreements improperly extending the scope of the claim's subject matter of said patent and has thereby misused said patent and has improperly restrained commerce.”","start":685.732,"stop":709.96,"duration":24.23},{"text":"And, on December 13, 1962, the Court of Appeals handed down its opinion in this case.","start":709.96,"stop":718.28,"duration":8.32},{"text":"10 days before, this Court had reversed that very Court of Appeals in the case of Fullman versus Davis, and this is what the Court said in considering the sufficiency of a pleading.","start":718.28,"stop":733.584,"duration":15.3},{"text":"If the -- this was in 371 U.S. “if the underlying facts or circumstances relied
