8:30 at night when he came home.","start":176.233,"stop":189.199,"duration":12.97},{"text":"On a day in question, March 22, 1962, the FBI agents in the execution of a search warrant previously obtained from a Commissioner in Chicago, executing a search warrant, went to the basement of the home of the Rugendorfs and in closets in the basement, found 81 furs which were subsequently identified as having been stolen in two burglaries.","start":189.199,"stop":211.376,"duration":22.18},{"text":"One in Shreveport, Louisiana in December of 1961 and the other in Mountain Brook, Alabama in January of 1961.","start":211.376,"stop":222.939,"duration":11.56},{"text":"Based on those facts and those facts alone, Rugendorf was convicted because furs were found in his home, in the basement in his home.","start":222.939,"stop":234.801,"duration":11.86},{"text":"There was no evidence that Rugendorf himself knew of the existence of furs.","start":234.801,"stop":239.798,"duration":5},{"text":"There was no evidence by the Government that he as much suspicioned the existence of the stolen furs in his basement.","start":239.798,"stop":247.116,"duration":7.32},{"text":"The affidavit in support of the search warrant obtained by an FBI affiant revealed that Sam Rugendorf, petitioner here, had a brother, Leo Rugendorf.","start":247.116,"stop":258.986,"duration":11.87},{"text":"And that from the facts as brought out both in the hearing on the motion to suppress the evidence and in the

affidavit.","start":258.986,"stop":282.65,"duration":23.66},{"text":"And that these thieves were the ones, according to the confidential informants, who had committed the burglaries in Alabama and in

furs.","start":282.65,"stop":304.352,"duration":21.7},{"text":"Therefore, the Government's theory was that Rugendorf was guilty because he was in constructive possession of the furs.","start":304.352,"stop":310.584,"duration":6.23},{"text":"But even if one is in constructive possession of stolen property, the next fact has to be decided from naked constructive possession of stolen property thus, knowledge of the stolen content of those items become chargeable to the constructive possessor by inference.","start":310.584,"stop":331.034,"duration":20.45},{"text":"There is no single case decided by this Court which decides that constructive possession gives rise to a further inference that the possessor posses them knowing the same to have been stolen.","start":331.034,"stop":345.186,"duration":14.15},{"text":"There is one case in the Court of Appeals, Russo, which we cite, which states that under circumstances such as this, he cannot pile the inference upon the inference and the presumption upon the presumption, and that conclude guilty knowledge.","start":345.186,"stop":361.095,"duration":15.91},{"text":"With respect to the other matters raised in the petition, the Court of Appeals has taken some dicta in Roviaro case, in this Court's Roviaro case, which apparently is interpreted differently by different circuits, the Ninth Circuit in Costello, interpreted Roviaro as requiring disclosure of confidential informant were unnecessary in a proceeding attacking the search warrant.","start":361.095,"stop":392.133,"duration":31.04},{"text":"The Fourth Circuit, the Winding case followed by the Seventh Circuit in this case, decided that in the proceeding where the Fourth Amendment is the issue, where constitutional rights of a defendant under the Fourth Amendment are at stake that he may not obtain the benefit of disclosure even where disclosure would be helpful and relevant to the defense and even where the disclosure is essential to a fair determination of the cause.","start":392.133,"stop":425.402,"duration":33.27},{"text":"As to that aspect of the case, that is a case and that is a point, a first impression before this Court, Roviaro did not decide that point at all and some of the Courts of Appeals have gone off on dicta in the case.","start":425.402,"stop":442.583,"duration":17.18},{"text":"Roviaro was a factual situation in which a -- in a narcotic case, the so-called informant was with, according to the Government, was with the seller of narcotics to a police officer.","start":442.583,"stop":457.93,"duration":15.35},{"text":"There was no issue in the Roviaro case of search warrant, of demand in a motion to suppress the evidence and there is no case decided by this Court previous to Roviaro which has it.","start":457.93,"stop":474.809,"duration":16.88},{"text":"And as I say, the several circuits have a different play.","start":474.809,"stop":479.205,"duration":4.4},{"text":"I see no reason why it is less important when one asserts his right under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.","start":479.205,"stop":487.504,"duration":8.3},{"text":"And then according to the Seventh Circuit -- according to the Fourth Circuit, cannot get information helpful in showing the invalidity of the search warrant than it -- then it is, if he needs that information which is essential to his case in chief.","start":487.504,"stop":503.905,"duration":16.4},{"text":"Because then the Courts of Appeals are downgrading the viability, the effectiveness of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.","start":503.905,"stop":513.017,"duration":9.11},{"text":"What they are saying is that you may not try to show invalidity in a search warrant because the Government's privilege to secrete the name of the informer is more important.","start":513.017,"stop":526.275,"duration":13.26},{"text":"Well, that poses a difficult question and a difficult situation for a defendant who as in the -- in this instance claimed at the trial, claimed at the time of his arrest, claimed at the trial, claimed in the Court of Appeals, complete innocence, complete absence of any connection with any of the details of the crime.","start":526.275,"stop":549.901,"duration":23.63},{"text":"He only owned a house in which there were furs found in the
