of two natural gas pipeline companies under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.","start":18.04,"stop":31.258,"duration":13.22},{"text":"The acquiring company is El Paso Natural Gas Company, which at the time of the acquisition was one of the two largest natural gas companies in the country and which was then the only company actually supplying natural gas -- interstate natural gas to California.","start":31.258,"stop":51.028,"duration":19.77},{"text":"The acquired company is Pacific Northwest Pipeline Company, then the only large interstate natural gas company west of the Rocky Mountains and a company which was seeking to enter the California market.","start":51.028,"stop":70.716,"duration":19.69},{"text":"Another aspect of the litigation growing out of this merger was here two years ago when the Court held that set aside in order of the Federal Power Commission, on the ground that it should not have preceded to approve the merger while an antitrust complaint was being prosecuted by the Department of Justice in the District Court.","start":70.716,"stop":92.147,"duration":21.43},{"text":"The question presented here is whether the acquisition itself violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act because it was an acquisition which may tend substantially to lessen competition in the -- in promoting projects for the sale of natural gas to California.","start":92.147,"stop":113.069,"duration":20.92},{"text":"The essential facts, at least the outline of the facts is really quite simple.","start":113.069,"stop":119.435,"duration":6.37},{"text":"We start with the California market for natural gas which was an -- an immense and very rapidly expanding market.","start":119.435,"stop":130.836,"duration":11.4},{"text":"In 1950 for example, six years before the merger, the consumption was 684 million cubic feet daily.","start":130.836,"stop":140.174,"duration":9.34},{"text":"In 1955, it was one billion cubic feet daily.","start":140.174,"stop":144.175,"duration":4},{"text":"In 1960, 1.3 billion, in 1965, it's estimated it'll be 1.6 billion and in 1970, two billion cubic feet daily.","start":144.175,"stop":156.737,"duration":12.56},{"text":"It's increasing in other words at an annual rate of approximately 200 million cubic feet a day, much the most dynamic as I understand it in the country.","start":156.737,"stop":168.441,"duration":11.7},{"text":"More than half of California's consumption comes from out-of-state.","start":168.441,"stop":173.988,"duration":5.55},{"text":"It's been 50%, 61% and it can be expected in all probability, but with no certainty to continue to be more than half.","start":173.988,"stop":184.393,"duration":10.41},{"text":"Natural gas is a principal source of energy, it being dependent on interstate pipelines.","start":184.393,"stop":193.391,"duration":9},{"text":"California's concern that it should not receive all its gas from one company or that it should be dependent even on one or two suppliers, is a very natural one.","start":193.391,"stop":203.509,"duration":10.12},{"text":"It's one that's been often expressed, the Federal Power Commission and expressed here before this Court.","start":203.509,"stop":211.027,"duration":7.52},{"text":"El Paso, at the time of the merger, was, as I have said, one of the largest natural gas pipeline companies in the country in --at assets of just under a billion dollars, 903 million.","start":211.027,"stop":225.551,"duration":14.52},{"text":"Its pipelines are shown on this separate map that I asked the clerk to distribute only because it was a convenient way of showing where these two companies run.","start":225.551,"stop":237.283,"duration":11.73},{"text":"I think, if anyone started looking in some of the details, he might be misled, and all I'm trying to do is show the main outlines.","start":237.283,"stop":245.953,"duration":8.67},{"text":"El Paso, you'll see, is marked in red.","start":245.953,"stop":248.907,"duration":2.95},{"text":"Its pipelines run from the San Juan Basin, a natural gas basin in Southwest in Colorado and Northwest in New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle and the Permian Basin in West Texas, out to the California border.","start":248.907,"stop":268.74,"duration":19.83},{"text":"At the California border, the gas is picked up either by Pacific Gas and Electric Company which is a distribution company that has virtually a monopoly of the distribution of gas in Northern California or by what are known as the Southern Companies, two affiliated companies which have virtually a monopoly of the distribution of gas in Southern California.","start":268.74,"stop":299.905,"duration":31.16},{"text":"Pacific Northwest was incorporated in 1959 and was certificated in 1954, initially with a view to serving the Northwestern states, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah.","start":299.905,"stop":319.637,"duration":19.73},{"text":"Its pipeline, you will see, is marked in blue.","start":319.637,"stop":323.267,"duration":3.63},{"text":"It runs from a connection with Canadian companies at the border at Sumas, Washington down paralleling the western edge of the Rocky Mountains, down to the San Juan Basin.","start":323.267,"stop":338.661,"duration":15.39},{"text":"Pacific Northwest had four assets or advantages that are worthy of note.","start":338.661,"stop":347.463,"duration":8.8},{"text":"In the first place, it was unique, I think, and that it had access both to the Canadian Gas which was becoming of increasing importance and to the San Juan Basin, another important source of gas.","start":347.463,"stop":361.785,"duration":14.32},{"text":"It lay adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and therefore adjacent to important future reserves of gas, which were then beginning to be developed.","start":361.785,"stop":374.814,"duration":13.03},{"text":"Having gas fields in either end, this was a flexible line, the line could be -- the gas could be made to flow in either direction or from the two ends to some point in the center where it might be carried off by a bridge line.","start":374.814,"stop":391.023,"duration":16.21},{"text":"And finally, I would point out that as these things go, while Pacific Northwest had no line to California, it was not far from the California market.","start":391.023,"stop":403.211,"duration":12.19},{"text":"I should say in that connection, to avoid any possible confusion that these two little orange lines going off from Pacific Northwest, one running south through Oregon and the other running across to Nevada, ought to be disregarded.","start":403.211,"stop":420.639,"duration":17.43},{"text":"They are little bitsy pipelines and they have no earthly importance in this proceeding or is a possible bridges from Pacific to California.","start":420.639,"stop":429.164,"duration":8.52},{"text":"And if we'd had some convenient way to eliminate them, I'd have stricken them right off the map.","start":429.164,"stop":436.754,"duration":7.59},{"text":"Almost from the time of its incorporation and certainly from the time of its certification, Pacific had a very real interest in the California market.","start":436.754,"stop":450.568,"duration":13.81},{"text":"In 1954, it engaged in discussions with Pacific Gas and Electric, with the view to bring down a supply of gas from Canada.","start":450.568,"stop":459.839,"duration":9.27},{"text":"Later that year, those preliminary conversations gave way to an agreement between Pacific, El Paso, and the Canadian company, Westcoast Transmission Company, to impart 300 million cubic feet a day through Mountain Home, Idaho which would be a point about halfway on Pacific's Line through Idaho and then to bring that gas down probably through Reno to California.","start":459.839,"stop":490.754,"duration":30.92},{"text":"Again I say the orange line has nothing to do that -- with that although it's about the location.","start":490.754,"stop":497.032,"duration":6.28},{"text":"That agreement was described by one of Pacific's officers in a report to a stockholder as having this effect.","start":497.032,"stop":505.417,"duration":8.38},{"text":"El Paso's California market will be protected against future competition.","start":505.417,"stop":510.52,"duration":5.1},{"text":"And if the agreement results in all parties now working together for a common end rather than fighting each other.","start":510.52,"stop":518.952,"duration":8.43},{"text":"This was only a plan.","start":518.952,"stop":521.22,"duration":2.27},{"text":"The agreement had been signed but it was felt through because the distribution companies refused to take the gas at the point at which the transmission companies wanted to lever -- to deliver it to California.","start":521.22,"stop":536.004,"duration":14.78},{"text":"Then in 1956, as I shall describe in more detail later, Pacific negotiated with Southern California Edison, a large user of gas and reached a tentative agreement on July 30, 1956 to impart gas to California, building a pipeline, provided that a -- another purchaser along with Edison could be found.","start":536.004,"stop":561.579,"duration":25.57}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"When was the earlier plan

Edison.","start":601.307,"stop":604.943,"duration":3.64},{"text":"As I say, I shall refer to the discussions with Edison at more length in the course of my argument.","start":604.943,"stop":611.994,"duration":7.05},{"text":"It's worth noting that when the president of El Paso learned of the negotiations between the Pacific and Edison, he went to Edison, told Edison that he knew about the negotiations, that he wanted to hold the market there in Southern California which he had all up at that time, and was prepared to supply it, and that he would

Pacific.","start":765.506,"stop":771.909,"duration":6.4},{"text":"The theory, I take it, was that while the stock acquisition did not require the approval of a -- the Federal Power Commission, an

evidence.","start":1098.04,"stop":1104.788,"duration":6.75},{"text":"Our case rests essentially on two propositions.","start":1104.788,"stop":1108.883,"duration":4.1},{"text":"First, we say that competition in the pipeline industry consists of rivalry in promoting future projects to transport and deliver large quantities of gas for a long period, 20 years or more on the average often through facilities to be constructed and beginning some time in the future, two, three and perhaps as far away as five years.","start":1108.883,"stop":1135.29,"duration":26.41},{"text":"In other words, this isn't simply the sale of units of gas today to be delivered tomorrow.","start":1135.29,"stop":1140.733,"duration":5.44},{"text":"It looks to long-term projects to bring gas to a market.","start":1140.733,"stop":1146.519,"duration":5.79},{"text":"Second, bearing in mind the nature of competition, we submit that El Paso's acquisition of what was then the only major pipeline company west of the Rocky and seeking to enter the California market, a company which was actively seeking to enter the California market made such a change in the structure of the market, as to require as a matter of law the conclusion that it would tend substantially to lessen competition.","start":1146.519,"stop":1181.869,"duration":35.35},{"text":"Let me first say just a word more about the nature of competition in this industry.","start":1181.869,"stop":1188.234,"duration":6.37},{"text":"As I say, what we think it consist of and I don't think that the defendants, the appellees disagree, is the promotion of rival projects among producers, one end of the bridge and among users or distributing companies at the other ends of the bridge, to put together links bringing the necessary gas to the market, and then to secure the approval of the Federal Power Commission.","start":1188.234,"stop":1217.759,"duration":29.53},{"text":"It's quite different from competition in the
