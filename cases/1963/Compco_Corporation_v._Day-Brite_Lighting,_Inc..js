of this type, having these slots became popular in the early 1950s.","start":146.343,"stop":156.82,"duration":10.48},{"text":"Shortly after that, they faced a problem in this art because the porcelain coating, this is like we find on sinks and bathtubs, this porcelain enamel, tended to chip and it was determined that the chipping occurred because of -- because the metal, the steel of this reflector, when it was heated during this enameling operation up to about 1600 degrees, tended to warp and twist so as to get out of alignment.","start":156.82,"stop":182.078,"duration":25.26},{"text":"And therefore, there were inbred strains, you might say, so that this fixture, when it was handled later on, would tend to chip, the porcelain enamel would pop off.","start":182.078,"stop":194.248,"duration":12.17},{"text":"This was solved by the respondent here, Day-Brite, by elongating these ribs so that they came down here

about this far.","start":215.553,"stop":217.886,"duration":2.33},{"text":"But in order to overcome this problem of porcelain chipping, especially along the sides, like these ribs, I beg your pardon,

resistance that it needed and this point was very heavily emphasized by Day-Brite, the initiator of the elongated ribs.","start":238.073,"stop":250.45,"duration":12.38},{"text":"We point out, in our brief, the feature of strength that was emphasized by Day-Brite.","start":250.45,"stop":258.25,"duration":7.8},{"text":"On page 11 of our brief, we have this little folded in advertisement of Day-Brite where they show a 358-pound man seated on one of these, showing how stiff and how strong they really are, emphasizing in bold letters the strength.","start":258.25,"stop":272.811,"duration":14.56},{"text":"Quite rightly, Day-Brite filed a mechanical patent application on this because this is a functional or a mechanical improvement.","start":272.811,"stop":279.733,"duration":6.92},{"text":"They filed this application.","start":279.733,"stop":281.632,"duration":1.9},{"text":"It went all the way to the Patent Office and to the Patent Office Board of Appeals and it was turned down because the Patent Office held that this was an obvious expedient, the normal thing someone would do if they wanted to increase the strength of a reflector.","start":281.632,"stop":295.826,"duration":14.19},{"text":"A common place example of the use of ribs is in corrugated paperboard.","start":295.826,"stop":301.897,"duration":6.07},{"text":"It's very easy to fold paperboard that way, parallel with the length of the corrugations or ribs, but you have to practically crack it in order to fold it the other way.","start":301.897,"stop":312.413,"duration":10.52},{"text":"So, that was what was attempted to be done here.","start":312.413,"stop":314.963,"duration":2.55},{"text":"There's one type of stiffness afforded by the slip and then the other type of stiffness can keep these sides from warping was provided

Office.","start":327.477,"stop":330.398,"duration":2.92},{"text":"They got a design patent.","start":330.398,"stop":332.317,"duration":1.92},{"text":"A design patent in contrast to a mechanical patent has to do with the ornamental aspect, the beauty, the aesthetics, the flow of curves and lines.","start":332.317,"stop":344.979,"duration":12.66},{"text":"This has to do with any industrial or commercial article.","start":344.979,"stop":349.467,"duration":4.49},{"text":"Any article of manufacture can be design patented.","start":349.467,"stop":352.362,"duration":2.9},{"text":"That includes

features.","start":352.362,"stop":365.386,"duration":13.02},{"text":"And they were successful in convincing the Patent Office that the reflector portion had this requisite ornamentation or distinctiveness as far as design is concerned.","start":365.386,"stop":377.078,"duration":11.69},{"text":"Now, this is precisely -- this same aspect of ornamentation or distinctiveness in the aesthetic sense is precisely the same thing that's involved in unfair competition.","start":377.078,"stop":389.248,"duration":12.17},{"text":"In this case, that people have always been believed to or permitted to copy the functional aspects.","start":389.248,"stop":397.869,"duration":8.62},{"text":"The unfair competition law in the past said, \"Well, there may be something wrong if you copy the nonfunctional or the aesthetic aspects because they serve to identify it.","start":397.869,"stop":408.438,"duration":10.57},{"text":"You don't have to do that in order to get a better article.\"","start":408.438,"stop":411.265,"duration":2.83},{"text":"However, the design patent was held invalid for two -- for two reasons.","start":411.265,"stop":415.878,"duration":4.61},{"text":"First of all, it was held non-inventive over what had gone before.","start":415.878,"stop":419.727,"duration":3.85},{"text":"The Court said merely extending these ribs didn't add anything really inventive as far as design is concerned and here we should appreciate that a design patent has to meet the same standards of invention as a mechanical patent.","start":419.727,"stop":434.06,"duration":14.33},{"text":"They're all in the same statute, both covered by the same statute.","start":434.06,"stop":437.321,"duration":3.26},{"text":"There's a difference that the maximum term of a design patent is 14 years, whereas, the term of a mechanical patent is automatically 17.","start":437.321,"stop":446.295,"duration":8.97},{"text":"So, they said that the Patent Office didn't have the best prior art before it.","start":446.295,"stop":451.015,"duration":4.72},{"text":"It didn't have anything that showed slots and ribs, at least coming across this far.","start":451.015,"stop":456.5,"duration":5.49},{"text":"So, when the court saw this better prior art, it said the design patent was invalid because the Patent Office hadn't seen the best prior art.","start":456.5,"stop":465.835,"duration":9.33},{"text":"The court also said that, clearly, the ribs are functional.","start":465.835,"stop":469.43,"duration":3.6},{"text":"Therefore, you can't have a design patent on that basis.","start":469.43,"stop":474.354,"duration":4.92},{"text":"Now Day-Brite, during the time that this patent was in effect, some five years or so, used this as a very effective sword.","start":474.354,"stop":482.571,"duration":8.22},{"text":"They made at least nine rather modest sized competitors, either change their construction or go out of the business entirely, these competitors ranging from Long Island out to Los Angeles.","start":482.571,"stop":499.587,"duration":17.02},{"text":"And, about the only thing that was common are these competitors had variations in this design.","start":499.587,"stop":505.278,"duration":5.69},{"text":"The one feature in common with all of them was the fact that they made use of this longer rib which was put in there for then purpose of strengthening.","start":505.278,"stop":513.563,"duration":8.28},{"text":"As far as we're concerned, the fact that they carried on this extensive litigation program certainly confirms the fact that Day-Brite elected to get its coverage, its protection, its monopoly on this, if you please, through the patent laws.","start":513.563,"stop":529.541,"duration":15.98},{"text":"And the law, as we understand it, is that when a patent expires, either prematurely by virtue of invalidation or by virtue of running its term, that particular construction goes into the public domain.","start":529.541,"stop":544.174,"duration":14.63},{"text":"That is the condition under which the patent is granted.","start":544.174,"stop":547.319,"duration":3.14},{"text":"The patent law specifies that there must be a complete disclosure, a full disclosure, just for the purpose so that at the end of the term, whether it's 14 years for a design patent or 17 years for a mechanical patent, that then the public who has given up this or given an individual this monopoly that then they could have the benefit of it and copy this.","start":547.319,"stop":568.539,"duration":21.22},{"text":"And the design patent shows exactly what we have here, give or take some changes in dimensions and sizes of curves and the like.","start":568.539,"stop":579.052,"duration":10.51},{"text":"We also see that this matter of patents is exclusely -- exclusively within the federal domain, and it's set down right in the constitution.","start":579.052,"stop":592.07,"duration":13.02},{"text":"So, what we have here is, where a person who has a meritorious invention, where the patent has been able to run the full length, the most he can get is 17 years.","start":592.07,"stop":603.468,"duration":11.4},{"text":"Here was an improvement not rising to the dignity of invention, yet, these people have a monopoly in perpetuity.","start":603.468,"stop":613.323,"duration":9.86},{"text":"So, it seems that the -- the lesser improvement merits the greater protection.","start":613.323,"stop":620.806,"duration":7.48},{"text":"Day-Brite is attempting to recapture this monopoly that they lost with the District Court's invalidating this design patent under the guise of unfair competition and to stop Compco from making the precise thing that was dedicated to the public by virtue of the premature expiration of the design patent.","start":620.806,"stop":643.433,"duration":22.63}]},{"speakerName":"Arthur J.
