negotiations between the Government and appellees had reached an impasse, appellees requested the District Court to enter an injunction which was narrower than that sought by the Government.","start":37.122,"stop":52.315,"duration":15.19},{"text":"The difference between these two decrees turned on factual issues without a trial of any kind on those issues or indeed, on any of the issues framed by the pleadings and without the consent of the Government, the District Court entered the injunction proposed by the appellees.","start":52.315,"stop":73.629,"duration":21.31},{"text":"The question simply stated is whether the District Court erred and so doing.","start":73.629,"stop":79.806,"duration":6.18},{"text":"The underlying facts are very briefly these, on March 6, 1961, two indictments were filed in the court below charging certain bakery companies with conduct which violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.","start":79.806,"stop":97.184,"duration":17.38},{"text":"In one indictment, all five appellees here were charged with combining and

quotations.","start":97.184,"stop":118.805,"duration":21.62},{"text":"In the second indictment, four of the five appellees here plus two other companies were charged with combining and conspiring to fix and maintain the prices in which they sold bakery products to nongovernment wholesale accounts which are defined as grocery stores, supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and similar large purchasers.","start":118.805,"stop":143.374,"duration":24.57},{"text":"All of the defendants in both criminal cases were convicted on their pleas of nolo contendere and fines were imposed.","start":143.374,"stop":154.023,"duration":10.65},{"text":"Now, the case at bar, a civil action, was brought against all five of the defendants who had been convicted of fixing prices in connection with the sales to the Government.","start":154.023,"stop":167.771,"duration":13.75},{"text":"Four of whom, as I've previously stated, were also convicted of fixing prices on the nongovernment sales.","start":167.771,"stop":176.761,"duration":8.99},{"text":"The complaint asked for both damages and injunctive relief pertaining to the violations on sales to the Government and in addition, a request for whatever more general injunctive relief might be deemed appropriate after a trial.","start":176.761,"stop":193.904,"duration":17.14},{"text":"Answers containing general denials were filed in due course and thereafter, consent decree negotiations were initiated by appellees with Government counsel.","start":193.904,"stop":205.718,"duration":11.81},{"text":"These negotiations followed the normal course.","start":205.718,"stop":209.428,"duration":3.71},{"text":"The parties first negotiated a settlement of a count for damages and they have reached an agreement pursuant to which the parties paid -- agreed to pay the Government $44,000.","start":209.428,"stop":222.435,"duration":13.01},{"text":"At that time, the -- the appellees offered to take an injunction limited to the specific prayers set forth in the complaint.","start":222.435,"stop":234.99,"duration":12.56},{"text":"The Government, this was not satisfactory to the Government, and the Government proposed a broader injunction enjoining the defendants from price fixing with regard to sales to third parties and forbidding certain attempts to set the price on resale of the appellees' bakery products.","start":234.99,"stop":255.08,"duration":20.09},{"text":"Counsel for the appellees refused to accept the Government's proposal and he then submitted a -- another proposal which was broader in scope than his first one and went beyond the scope of the prayers for relief in the complaint.","start":255.08,"stop":272.272,"duration":17.19},{"text":"Further attempts to negotiate, and they were a good many, which I won't detail, were fruitless and the negotiations reached an impasse.","start":272.272,"stop":284.061,"duration":11.79},{"text":"And just briefly, the Government wished two provisions to which the appellees would not agree.","start":284.061,"stop":290.606,"duration":6.55},{"text":"First, that they be enjoined from price fixing with regard to sales to third parties and second, that they be enjoined from setting the price on resale of their bakery products.","start":290.606,"stop":303.722,"duration":13.12},{"text":"Appellees then filed a motion in the court below for entry of their first judgment.","start":303.722,"stop":309.428,"duration":5.71},{"text":"The Court issued an order to show cause why the judgment shouldn't be entered.","start":309.428,"stop":314.624,"duration":5.2},{"text":"Appellees then amended the motion to have the Court enter their broader proposal and a hearing was held on this motion.","start":314.624,"stop":325.471,"duration":10.85},{"text":"At the hearing, the Court was advised by counsel for both sides of the nature of the impasse.","start":325.471,"stop":335.747,"duration":10.28},{"text":"And he was advised by counsel for the Government that at the trial and at the hearing on relief, the Government would bring in evidence to support its broader decree.","start":335.747,"stop":349.761,"duration":14.01},{"text":"Now, the understanding of the Court and counsel for the appellees seemed to be that if the Court entered appellees' proposed decree, the Government did not have a right to go to trial.","start":349.761,"stop":366.507,"duration":16.75},{"text":"But if the Court decided to enter the Government's proposed decree, then the appellees would have the right to go to trial.","start":366.507,"stop":375.448,"duration":8.94},{"text":"I'd -- I would call the Court's attention to this unusual situations, which is in the Government's brief reproduced in a footnote at page 33, and I just briefly summarize it.","start":375.448,"stop":390.982,"duration":15.53},{"text":"The Court says, \"Let me say this

sir.\"","start":412.518,"stop":415.107,"duration":2.59},{"text":"And then the counsel for the appellees went on and he said, \"We did not agree that we were foreclosed from a right to go to trial if you decided to enter the Government's decree.\"","start":415.107,"stop":429.709,"duration":14.6},{"text":"Now, I -- I agree that the appellees were correct in asking for their day in Court and that's just what we're asking here.","start":429.709,"stop":439.19,"duration":9.48},{"text":"The Court then, on December 10 of 1962, entered as a final judgment in this case.","start":439.19,"stop":446.633,"duration":7.44},{"text":"The defendant second proposed judgment was modified in certain respects at the

case.","start":571.452,"stop":574.623,"duration":3.17},{"text":"Instead, the Government asked that the District Court's judgment be vacated and the case be remanded for
