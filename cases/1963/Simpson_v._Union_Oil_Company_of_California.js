proceedings in the District Court.","start":219.207,"stop":240.647,"duration":21.44},{"text":"Let me say as to that matter that petitioner had filed interrogatories to the respondent mainly on the interstate commerce issue and that the District Court thereupon entered an opinion in which he said that he did not feel that pretrial discovery should be granted until pretrial conferences which defined the issues.","start":240.647,"stop":265.473,"duration":24.83},{"text":"And thereupon we had two pretrial conferences in which there were suggestions that this case could be first stipulated and then brought to the Appellate Courts.","start":265.473,"stop":277.675,"duration":12.2},{"text":"When that stipulation broke down there was suggestion that counsel for plaintiff file a pretrial statement for a pretrial ruling that counsel for respondent would then admit or deny those facts and that the appeal to be taken in that direction.","start":277.675,"stop":291.565,"duration":13.89},{"text":"Now there -- so that pretrial statement or pretrial ruling is in the record.","start":291.565,"stop":295.183,"duration":3.62},{"text":"However, counsel did not or respondent did not accept this pretrial statement and rather he noticed the deposition of the plaintiff

thereafter abstracted and presented to the Court in a motion for summary judgment on all issues and that motion for summary judgment on all issues, stipulations were further continued by respondents

done.","start":310.535,"stop":339.911,"duration":29.38},{"text":"Now that motion for partial summary judgment was denied and the motion for summary judgment on all issues was granted by the District Court.","start":339.911,"stop":348.981,"duration":9.07},{"text":"Now these pretrial conferences, including the motion for summary judgment raise five distinct stipulations by the respondent Union Oil company.","start":348.981,"stop":359.543,"duration":10.56},{"text":"As I have urged in my brief these stipulations were inevitable because the records consisting of policy letters concerning this consignment program pretty much corroborated and compelled these stipulations.","start":359.543,"stop":373.314,"duration":13.77},{"text":"Now the first is, there is no question that the only lease that Union Oil would write was the one-year lease.","start":373.314,"stop":382.576,"duration":9.26},{"text":"The only consignment agreement was a one-year consignment agreement.","start":382.576,"stop":386.596,"duration":4.02},{"text":"However, that consignment agreement was carried on year-to-year, assuming the lease was renewed.","start":386.596,"stop":394.104,"duration":7.51},{"text":"It was stipulated that the only manner in which a service station dealer could obtain a lease from Union Oil Company was to subscribe

sites in the eight specific state areas and also the consignment agreement was entered into with other purchase and sales accounts so that there are (Inaudible) here in 2000 tie-in consignment agreements and an additional approximately 1000 consignment agreements with other types of accounts.","start":411.272,"stop":445.827,"duration":34.56},{"text":"It is also stipulated that a lease would not be renewed if the dealer did not carry out the authorized directives of the consignment retail price fixing program.","start":445.827,"stop":465.641,"duration":19.81},{"text":"It was further stipulated that this particular plaintiff's lease was not renewed at the end of the year because he did in fact disobey the orders of Union Oil Company and I think it is fair to say he did not obey the price fixing order, I think it's narrowed to that extent, the price fixing orders.","start":465.641,"stop":496.447,"duration":30.81},{"text":"I have in my brief set forth that quotation in full I believe.","start":496.447,"stop":503.035,"duration":6.59},{"text":"I would -- the record of 409, “It is a conceded fact in the case that he, the plaintiff, did violate the consignment agreement

stipulation, I would like to call for the Court's attention, is the fact that the respondent for -- the counsel for the respondent stipulated that a purpose of the retail dealer consignment program was to fix prices.","start":583.031,"stop":602.394,"duration":19.36},{"text":"One state in the record -- one section of the record was a purpose and then it was a purpose among other purposes was to fix the retail prices.","start":602.394,"stop":614.213,"duration":11.82},{"text":"Now in addition as I have indicated to these stipulations during the pretrial proceedings counsel for the respondent submitted to the plaintiff's counsel the so called policy letters, which were letters issued by the general sales manager of the Union Oil Company to the division managers in which he explains in detail, gave instructions to them concerning this consignment program.","start":614.213,"stop":650.922,"duration":36.71},{"text":"Now we were touching upon the issues of the case but believe the major issue would be that first issue whether or not you can regiment a marketing system and cull off independent judgments as to prices by utilizing this one-year lease renewal as a record.","start":650.922,"stop":670.012,"duration":19.09}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Could I ask you a question?","start":670.012,"stop":672.795,"duration":2.78},{"text":"As I understand it, the Court of Appeals did not reach the substantive question --","start":672.795,"stop":678.536,"duration":5.74}]},{"speakerName":"Maxwell Keith","textObjs":[{"text":"The Court of Appeals assumed a violation of the anti-trust laws and went on the ground that there was no actionable damages and utilized the doctrine of consent and ruled that when a dealer entered into the lease consignment structure of Union Oil Company with his eyes wide open, he knew he is going to have to sign this agreement that he could not thereafter obtain damages because he had full knowledge and he walked into the scheme with his eyes wide open.","start":678.536,"stop":715.311,"duration":36.78},{"text":"And it also applied the same doctrine of consent to the secondary aspect of the plaintiff's case which was claiming that prices were fixed during the period of in-station occupancy pursuant to coercive program, which was structured upon lease renewal, and there upon the dealer suffered injurious price fixing orders for which he could be compensated under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.","start":715.311,"stop":746.863,"duration":31.55},{"text":"And as to that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said when the state of the record shows that the dealer does in fact charge his own price and raises the conflict of facts between the supplier and the dealer that he cannot thereafter sue for in-station damages because in fact he could charge his own prices.","start":746.863,"stop":768.067,"duration":21.2},{"text":"The only theory was that he had -- he couldn't get the station the next year, although he had expended substantial money for the service station business.","start":768.067,"stop":779.176,"duration":11.11}]},{"speakerName":"Arthur J.

Goldberg","textObjs":[{"text":"(Inaudible)","start":798.997,"stop":809.298,"duration":10.3}]},{"speakerName":"Maxwell Keith","textObjs":[{"text":"He -- I think the record will be undisputed that he was to charge on the regular type of gasoline 29.9 that his competitors -- his three immediate competitors were charging 27.9 that he asked the respondent's agents to meet this price and that he was refused and that thereafter he set it at 27.9.","start":809.298,"stop":832.66,"duration":23.36}]},{"speakerName":"Arthur J. Goldberg","textObjs":[{"text":"(Inaudible)","start":832.66,"stop":833.439,"duration":0.78}]},{"speakerName":"Maxwell Keith","textObjs":[{"text":"And that's what precipitated this matter.","start":833.439,"stop":839.659,"duration":6.22},{"text":"So the second issue before the Court is whether or not the doctrine of consent, a court doctrine has application to a Section 4 action based upon lease, non-renewal or lease cancelation when the dealer did have knowledge of the consignment program of the respondent.","start":839.659,"stop":865.285,"duration":25.63},{"text":"Now I think there should be a distinction made here that's important and that is whether or not assuming that a consent doctrine can be applied, which I allege cannot be, whether or not that can be made in summary judgment because the consent even in classical tort doctrine has usually been an affirmative defense and has been raised only upon the factual showing at a trial.","start":865.285,"stop":892.597,"duration":27.31},{"text":"Now here the doctrine was applied in a summary judgment situation and here it was applied when the record clearly showed protest by the petitioner against the orders of the defendant or the respondent here.","start":892.597,"stop":911.844,"duration":19.25},{"text":"Now my motion for a partial summary judgment is based upon stipulations and I believe positive and unrefutable proof in the record, the question is whether or not plaintiff is entitled to finding the fact based upon stipulation that lease non-renewal has been used and will be used in order to regiment a price fixed organization.","start":911.844,"stop":938.461,"duration":26.62},{"text":"And I urge that this stipulation constitutes violations of both Sections 1 and Sections 2 of the Sherman Act.","start":938.461,"stop":950.602,"duration":12.14},{"text":"Another issue before the Court is whether or not we are talking about consignment or we are talking about resale price fixing because I urge upon the Court that we don't have a consignment agreement here at all.","start":950.602,"stop":964.397,"duration":13.8},{"text":"What we have here is a resale price fixing agreement.","start":964.397,"stop":969.934,"duration":5.54},{"text":"Then we have a last issue as to whether or not plaintiff's right to trial by jury has been violated in view of the fact that counsel at all times herein in his moving papers attempted to preserve a right to trial by jury for the plaintiff below.","start":969.934,"stop":991.148,"duration":21.21},{"text":"As heretofore indicated, the petitioner is a service station dealer and he obtained one of the best available sites that Union Oil Company had in its chain in May of 1956.","start":991.148,"stop":1007.724,"duration":16.58},{"text":"He had been employed by the company and upon the termination of his employment, he was offered by his agents his choice of the best available site of the chain and he picked a very good service station site in Fresno where he had a relative.","start":1007.724,"stop":1024.377,"duration":16.65}]},{"speakerName":"Potter

not too sure of that, but I believe it was a new station that was available at that time.","start":1027.766,"stop":1041.249,"duration":13.48},{"text":"The petitioner in order to obtain this service station site was handed his one-year lease, was handed his retail dealer consignment agreement, which he signed.","start":1041.249,"stop":1052.738,"duration":11.49},{"text":"And also I would like to point out that in order to obtain the station he was required to spend approximately $3500 of his own in order to obtain the necessary equipment and supplies to run that service station business.","start":1052.738,"stop":1069.67,"duration":16.93},{"text":"He was -- at the end of the year, as is customary, he was given another one-year lease.","start":1069.67,"stop":1075.515,"duration":5.85},{"text":"The record shows that that time protested consignment and he did take the lease and continued to be a so called consignment operator during the remainder of that one-year period.","start":1075.515,"stop":1092.896,"duration":17.38},{"text":"The respondent, Union Oil Company of California, is one of the largest of the seven major fully integrated oil companies on the West Coast.","start":1092.896,"stop":1105.094,"duration":12.2},{"text":"It explores for oil.","start":1105.094,"stop":1108.322,"duration":3.23},{"text":"It refines oil into petroleum.","start":1108.322,"stop":1111.432,"duration":3.11},{"text":"It distributes and retails petroleum products.","start":1111.432,"stop":1117.228,"duration":5.8},{"text":"The record shows and the complaint alleged that in addition to supplying retailers under the banner of Union Oil company, it distributes substantial quantities of its refined petroleum products to so-called off brand service stations who will sell this gasoline of Union Oil Company under different trade name.","start":1117.228,"stop":1142.899,"duration":25.67},{"text":"And I think the record also shows by way of depositions that I had taken that these off brand companies attempt to sell their gasoline at $0.01 or $0.02 below the established price that the majors have, the fully integrated companies.","start":1142.899,"stop":1160.776,"duration":17.88},{"text":"Around 1954, the later part of 1954, the defendant promulgated its retail dealer price fixing consignment program and the ostensible and the written purpose was in order to control prices.","start":1160.776,"stop":1176.02,"duration":15.24},{"text":"And the letters from the general sales manager say to the people in the field that these agreements are to be used when we want to control prices in a price war situation.","start":1176.02,"stop":1190.647,"duration":14.63},{"text":"That when the price war situation is over, the dealers will go off, consignment will put them back to purchase and sales, that's in the beginning of the program.","start":1190.647,"stop":1199.698,"duration":9.05},{"text":"Respondent points out that around May of 1955 that a change was made and that the respondent company attempted to make the consignment program a permanent measure and not one that was to be temporarily used in a price war situation, but you'll notice in the record, “The statement continued we will use consignment when we want to control retail pricing.”","start":1199.698,"stop":1228.49,"duration":28.79},{"text":"Now we have established the policy of the one-year lease and the policy of the tie-in.","start":1228.49,"stop":1238.1,"duration":9.61},{"text":"The affect of this tie-in policy was to establish uniform and non competitive prices in the eight western states as far as Union Oil Company was concerned and its three thousand dealers under the consignment program.","start":1238.1,"stop":1255.791,"duration":17.69},{"text":"Because the orders were in the beginning charged one or two cents over your major competitors, and by major they are referring to the fully integrated majors, later the orders were charged the same as the predominant major price which is the major oil companies or charged what Standard Stations, Inc., charges, whichever is the lower price.","start":1255.791,"stop":1282.34,"duration":26.55},{"text":"And these were the prices that were established in the policy letters, uniform prices based upon what Standard Station was charging.","start":1282.34,"stop":1296.642,"duration":14.3},{"text":"Now we know that those prices were regimented under the threat of non-renewal of these one-year leases not only by reason of the stipulation of counsel, but by reason of the record, which shows a letter that states that we will refuse – “We will review rather all the dealers who have not agreed to our consignment program even to the extent of losing the business.”","start":1296.642,"stop":1329.905,"duration":33.26},{"text":"And we know when changes were made in the consignment program, in the consignment agreement itself, the orders were, “Those dealers who do not agree to sign or subscribe to the new agreement, we will send him a letter of cancellation and when that letter -- when the time of cancellation has expired, we will then give him the new agreement to be signed and subscribed.”","start":1329.905,"stop":1355.735,"duration":25.83},{"text":"The obvious inference is if he doesn't sign or subscribe it, his lease is not going to be renewed.","start":1355.735,"stop":1361.828,"duration":6.09},{"text":"Now the retail dealer consignment agreement itself places virtually all the risk of the business on the dealer, just as the lease does.","start":1361.828,"stop":1371.38,"duration":9.55},{"text":"He is responsible to his employees, and Union Oil has no responsibility insofar as the employees of the dealer are concerned.","start":1371.38,"stop":1378.976,"duration":7.6},{"text":"He is responsible for all the business fees and the license fees and all the taxes except the reserved property taxes which Union Oil claims to pay.","start":1378.976,"stop":1389.636,"duration":10.66},{"text":"Then all the risks of property damage, personal injury liability are placed right on the dealer.","start":1389.636,"stop":1398.791,"duration":9.15},{"text":"The only insurable risk that the respondent claims to cover are those caused by natural catastrophe, that if there is leakage in the pumps or if a car runs amuck and knocks a pump over and a gasoline is spilled, or if there is theft that the dealer will carry the burdens of that kind of loss and not Union Oil company.","start":1398.791,"stop":1424.547,"duration":25.76},{"text":"Now the agreement of course expressively provides Union shall fix the price of gasoline and it does so, on the assumed basis that it is giving the dealers a commission upon the sale of the gasoline.","start":1424.547,"stop":1443.425,"duration":18.88},{"text":"Now this commission when it first came out was very much equivalent to margin.","start":1443.425,"stop":1448.697,"duration":5.27},{"text":"Now the commission was simply the base -- the difference between the authorized consignment price, which is a retail price, and the Union Oil Company's tank wagon price or the wholesale price.","start":1448.697,"stop":1465.262,"duration":16.57},{"text":"However, the agreement provided that a commission would be guaranteed, and that will be the 6.5 or 5.5 before rent.","start":1465.262,"stop":1475.37,"duration":10.11},{"text":"There's some dispute as to which figure was to be used, which was to be guaranteed.","start":1475.37,"stop":1481.619,"duration":6.25},{"text":"Later a change was made so that the consignment agreement provided that the dealer would assume 50%, one half of the difference between the authorized consignment price and a so called normal retail price when the consignment price went below this normal retail price.","start":1481.619,"stop":1504.285,"duration":22.67},{"text":"Then in March of 1958, in a letter written by respondent's general sales manager, “in order to be on the same basis as purchase and sale of the company and in order to have the dealer participate in price decline, the respondent Union Oil Company determined to have the dealer absorb 20% of the decline in prices” and no more guaranteed commissions.","start":1504.285,"stop":1538.734,"duration":34.45},{"text":"What they did do is they sent a letter to the dealer saying we are going on this new program, you will have a commission guaranteed, however we reserve the right to cancel this letter at any time.","start":1538.734,"stop":1550.131,"duration":11.4},{"text":"And as you study the sliding scales of the respondent in March of 1958, you will see that they are all based upon a 20% participation of a price decline, and whereas in the old days the 5.5 or the 6 cents was there, in the new sliding scale they go down to 3.5 cents commission.","start":1550.131,"stop":1580.742,"duration":30.61},{"text":"I have touched upon the facts relating to the cancellation of the plaintiff for the non-renewal of his one-year lease.","start":1580.742,"stop":1594.547,"duration":13.81},{"text":"The fact that he was attempting to meet a market situation that he asked to be able to meet this that he was refused.","start":1594.547,"stop":1603.241,"duration":8.69},{"text":"And I'd like to point out at this point that the answer or the complaint first alleged that plaintiff was threatened with lease cancellation quietly by agents.","start":1603.241,"stop":1622.494,"duration":19.25},{"text":"And the answer in effect admits that an agent of the Union Oil Company came to petitioner's service station and told him that they could do what they could -- would do in order to raise the price of petitioner.","start":1622.494,"stop":1639.203,"duration":16.71},{"text":"Now the deposition of the petitioner says that the agent, a district manager, Mr. Kirkberg, came marching in and said, “You had better raise those prices and unless you do, I am going to call Mr. Raff in Los Angeles and we will use the full power of Union Oil Company to make you raise those prices.”","start":1639.203,"stop":1661.012,"duration":21.81},{"text":"Mr. Simpson held on to his 27.9 price and a short time later he was told
