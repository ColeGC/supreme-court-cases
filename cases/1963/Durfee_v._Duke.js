change it but the court concluded that the ground in question was situated west of a point where the river was established and didn't have to determine the other feature as to how the river got to where it was since it was already west of that particular point, the ground was in Nebraska and consequently, it didn't come to any conclusion as to how the river changed, that is whether by accretion

restatement.","start":3284.549,"stop":3305.02,"duration":20.47},{"text":"The first of them being that the lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter was clear.","start":3305.02,"stop":3310.252,"duration":5.23},{"text":"I would like to point out that in coming to that particular criteria, the Eighth Circuit Court itself says that Nebraska's lack of

of jurisdiction over the subject matter is not particularly clear.","start":3349.683,"stop":3375.326,"duration":25.64},{"text":"So I submit that aside from the fact that if this is a proper
