Court.","start":83.362,"stop":92.497,"duration":9.14},{"text":"Count 2 was held by the trial court to sufficiently state a federal question for the purpose of obtaining a declaratory judgment as to the validity of proxies.","start":92.497,"stop":106.687,"duration":14.19},{"text":"Our trial court held that the reference to Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act was sufficient to give it

individual, are of the view that Count 2 of this complaint states a derivative cause of action.","start":293.549,"stop":303.925,"duration":10.38},{"text":"That is an action that is brought in the right of the corporation, that it's really the corporation's cause of action that the corporation is not enforcing, so a stockholder has appointed himself as champion of the stockholders and is bringing it for the corporation.","start":303.925,"stop":323.349,"duration":19.42},{"text":"The Securities Exchange Commission, amicus before this Court at pages 16 and 17 of their brief, I believe agree with us.","start":323.349,"stop":334.612,"duration":11.26},{"text":"Where at the top of page 17 of their brief, they state, \"We do not dispute the characterization of the action as derivative

argument.","start":353.381,"stop":364.132,"duration":10.75},{"text":"I certainly not going to accuse counsel of having a -- reached an agreement with us but I think it is significant that counsel recognizes that this is an important point and an important feature of the entire case because they very readily assumed and admit that Count 2 maybe derivative for the purposes of extended argument.","start":364.132,"stop":391.947,"duration":27.82},{"text":"Now, our position is this, that if Count 2 is derivative then under the rule of Howard versus First, we must look to the statutory history of the Securities Exchange Act and determine whether the Securities Exchange Act is intended to create any substantive rights in a corporate issuer.","start":391.947,"stop":418.062,"duration":26.12},{"text":"The Second Circuit in going through this, processed -- found there was no such legislative history.","start":418.062,"stop":425.332,"duration":7.27},{"text":"In fact, the legislative history was to the contrary.","start":425.332,"stop":430.93,"duration":5.6},{"text":"The general statement as to the purpose of this legislation is that as far as proxy solicitation is concerned, the purpose is to bring about the broad public need for full disclosure and as the Second Circuit related in its opinion, this is a not a right -- a substantive right in the corporate issuer who ordinarily issues the proxy statements.","start":430.93,"stop":463.151,"duration":32.22},{"text":"And that the Securities Exchange Act was to protect investors and not the corporate issuers.","start":463.151,"stop":471.655,"duration":8.5},{"text":"Other cases, the Brout (ph) case which we have cited goes -- traces much of the same history and reaches, in general, the same conclusion.","start":471.655,"stop":484.32,"duration":12.67},{"text":"Now, this being the case, the Second Circuit, finding no legislative history to support a right in the corporation, held that in a derivative action, a federal cause of action was not stated by the mere reference to Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act.","start":484.32,"stop":507.812,"duration":23.49},{"text":"And we submit that this decision of Howard versus First is well reasoned, it's consistent and logical.","start":507.812,"stop":518.051,"duration":10.24},{"text":"We have also cited a case called Lapchak versus Sisto, Judge Dimock in the District Court in New York in which he, to our way of mind, succinctly states the situation with respect to proxy solicitation.","start":518.051,"stop":537.925,"duration":19.87},{"text":"In this Lapchak case, we had a fact situation very similar to the one in the case at bar, where there was a claim that director's had -- have profited by a sale of assets of a corporation.","start":537.925,"stop":552.665,"duration":14.74},{"text":"Judge Dimock states it very succinctly this way.","start":552.665,"stop":557.837,"duration":5.17},{"text":"He says, \"If the proxy statement which is alleged to be bad under Section 14 (a) of the Act were followed by a fair exchange, the directors would not be liable to the corporation.","start":557.837,"stop":571.735,"duration":13.9},{"text":"Also, it is perfectly clear that had the proxy statement been perfectly lawful but followed by an unfair exchange, the directors would be liable.","start":571.735,"stop":581.595,"duration":9.86},{"text":"Since liability, asserted by plaintiffs and maybe approved without regard to the proxy statements and cannot be proved without regard to the alleged breach of fiduciary duty, it is impossible to say that the plaintiffs are asserting a right under or created by federal law.","start":581.595,"stop":600.2,"duration":18.61},{"text":"We believe the logic and the consistency of that statement is irrefutable.","start":600.2,"stop":605.676,"duration":5.48},{"text":"In -- in fact, we don't believe that opposing counsel has sufficiently distinguished the case or made a real comment on it.","start":605.676,"stop":615.661,"duration":9.98}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"So supposed a vice and proxy statement has its failure to make a -- a full and fair
