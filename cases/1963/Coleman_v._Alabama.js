discrimination.","start":156.473,"stop":178.149,"duration":21.68},{"text":"The Court said absolutely nothing about any waiver and quite clearly decided the case on a ground which made waiver moot.","start":178.149,"stop":186.927,"duration":8.78},{"text":"Now, as the ruling of the Supreme Court of Alabama which we ask this Court to reverse is the opportunity which that Court said

exclusion.","start":217.909,"stop":232.69,"duration":14.78},{"text":"Petitioner's counsel at the hearing attempts to place on the stand the two Circuit Solicitors who had tried petitioner in order to prove the allegations of the motion for new trial.","start":232.69,"stop":245.969,"duration":13.28},{"text":"And on page 18, we see the response of the Circuit Solicitor.","start":245.969,"stop":251.136,"duration":5.17},{"text":"He argues that the question has been waived and there on the 11th line at page 19, he urges to the trial court, we don't think any evidence along that line would be legal and we would object any evidence because it would just be a waste of time.","start":251.136,"stop":265.529,"duration":14.39},{"text":"Now at this point, the

evidence.","start":279.757,"stop":284.571,"duration":4.81},{"text":"The trial judge says, “No.","start":284.571,"stop":285.967,"duration":1.4},{"text":"You put your witness on the

20, the Solicitor is placed on the stand and the foundation is laid.","start":298.441,"stop":306.785,"duration":8.34},{"text":"He -- he testifies that he's practiced law on the county for a number of years, that he is familiar with Negroes and Whites in the county, that he has never missed the grand jury in the county.","start":306.785,"stop":319.045,"duration":12.26},{"text":"But when the

new trial.","start":328.46,"stop":334.014,"duration":5.55},{"text":"And on page 22 of the record, the trial court clearly sustains that objection on just that ground.","start":334.014,"stop":341.585,"duration":7.57},{"text":"Petitioner's attorney asks two more questions, how many Negroes if any were on the grand jury, same objection, same

Court of Alabama on that ground, that petitioner did have an opportunity.","start":382.859,"stop":392.242,"duration":9.38},{"text":"But now the state seems to be arguing something different that -- it was in fact the waiver.","start":392.242,"stop":398.718,"duration":6.48},{"text":"I don't believe that the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama, the judgment here on review, is susceptible to that interpretation.","start":398.718,"stop":409.128,"duration":10.41},{"text":"First, the Court said absolutely nothing about

state cited waiver cases to the Court.","start":446.915,"stop":452.126,"duration":5.21},{"text":"They were not cited in the Court -- in the Supreme Court of Alabama's opinion but fairly easy idea to convey.","start":452.126,"stop":457.578,"duration":5.45},{"text":"There are many opinions in -- in Alabama where -- where the waiver holding is the one which disposes of the case, nothing like it in this opinion.","start":457.578,"stop":468.359,"duration":10.78},{"text":"But most important, the Supreme Court of Alabama decided this case on the ground which is totally incompatible with the finding or holding of waiver.","start":468.359,"stop":479.759,"duration":11.4},{"text":"In other words, what the Supreme Court of Alabama did and it's right here on pages 32 and 33 of the record, in its opinion, it held that petitioner had a burden of proof and he hadn't -- haven't met, it held on the evidence.","start":479.759,"stop":495.456,"duration":15.7},{"text":"Now, if you don't have any right, it makes no difference whatsoever, how much evidence you put on.","start":495.456,"stop":502.329,"duration":6.87},{"text":"What the -- what the trial court did was say you had no right, so you can't put on any evidence.","start":502.329,"stop":508.577,"duration":6.25},{"text":"What the Supreme Court of Alabama does, put that -- put the waiver argument to the side and decide completely on the basis of evidence.","start":508.577,"stop":519.352,"duration":10.77},{"text":"Now, I don't think it's important whether or not the Supreme Court of Alabama had any power under Alabama law as viewed from prior cases to do what it did.","start":519.352,"stop":533.783,"duration":14.43},{"text":"The judgment in this case is bottomed on a finding of the evidence, not on a finding of waiver.","start":533.783,"stop":542.864,"duration":9.08},{"text":"The -- the judgment of the -- in this case is bottomed on petitioner's opportunity to introduce proof.","start":542.864,"stop":551.398,"duration":8.53},{"text":"But nonetheless, there are Alabama cases, the Clark and Arrington cases which are cited on page 12 in our brief, where the Supreme Court of Alabama has done exactly what it did here.","start":551.398,"stop":564.403,"duration":13},{"text":"In other words, the jury question was raised for the first time on motion for new trial, the case came up from the Supreme Court of Alabama and it decided the case on the evidence or indicated that it had the power to decide the case on the evidence.","start":564.403,"stop":580.593,"duration":16.19},{"text":"There is even a -- a very recent case on coram nobis where the Supreme Court of Alabama said we know in deciding this case that the petitioner here did not raise this question prior to trial or on motion for new trial, that's the Howard case in 151 Southern Reporter.","start":580.593,"stop":602.907,"duration":22.31},{"text":"And there's another one where the same statement is made, the Sills case, 126 Southern Reporter.","start":602.907,"stop":610.194,"duration":7.29},{"text":"So as we view this case, it comes clearly under the rule of Cole versus Alabama, recently reaffirmed by this Court, I think about two weeks ago in the Shuttlesworth case, that a Supreme Court of a state must dispose of a case upon consideration of what happened in the trial court.","start":610.194,"stop":634.346,"duration":24.15},{"text":"Now, in Cole the -- the conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Arkansas on the basis of a violation of law which was not tried below and this Court reversed it because the -- the criminal defendant did not have an opportunity to defend himself to put in evidence.","start":634.346,"stop":654.816,"duration":20.47},{"text":"So here, petitioner has not had an opportunity to put in evidence establishing a constitutional defense.","start":654.816,"stop":663.128,"duration":8.31},{"text":"The reason he hasn't had that opportunity is because the trial court took the view totally incompatible with the view taken by the Supreme Court of Alabama, that he had no right, no right to establish.","start":663.128,"stop":675.933,"duration":12.8},{"text":"Now, I think coming to this record Cole, the Court might have some question about why the Supreme Court did what it did, even though it's totally explicit, what it did.","start":675.933,"stop":688.588,"duration":12.65},{"text":"And I think the answer is in two cases briefly discussed in our brief, the Sills and Golsby cases in which the Fifth Circuit has held that in situations like this, where a Negro is represented by a court appointed white lawyer in the South, and the state does not show that he knowingly and intentionally waived his constitutional rights that if the Fifth Circuit is held that it will not be precluded from examining the evidence of the jury question.","start":688.588,"stop":722.502,"duration":33.91},{"text":"And the Supreme Court of Alabama knows about this cases and it is modifying what -- what we might call its traditional policy of -- of being fairly hard on litigants who don't raise the question early in light of these cases, in light of its knowledge that the same issue was going to be relitigated in the Fifth Circuit if the Supreme Court of Alabama holds waiver.","start":722.502,"stop":749.821,"duration":27.32},{"text":"But I want to make it perfectly clear that I don't think any analysis based on those cases is involved here.","start":749.821,"stop":757.162,"duration":7.34},{"text":"The Supreme Court of Alabama did what it did, and that's the judgment here for review.","start":757.162,"stop":763.003,"duration":5.84},{"text":"The only -- the only way I can rationalize the State's argument is that they are saying to this Court, Alabama's Supreme Court could've held waiver.","start":763.003,"stop":777.1,"duration":14.1},{"text":"It could've decided in this case on nonfederal grounds, and if -- because the Supreme Court of Alabama didn't do it, it could have, this Court should do it.","start":777.1,"stop":787.499,"duration":10.4},{"text":"Now there are a long line of cases where this sort of position has been argued to the Court and it's always been rejected.","start":787.499,"stop":794.478,"duration":6.98},{"text":"The leading case is -- is Grayson versus Howard -- Harrison in 267 U.S.I would like to reserve my
