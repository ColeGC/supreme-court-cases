quotation and since it was decided by the Fifth Circuit at the same term of court and is so utterly inconsistent with the position taken in this decision appeal from that I read, \"Where the only

condemnation case, wherein this -- the Fifth Circuit had previously held, we do not think it necessary that we require, in applying the clearly erroneous doctrine, a special finding of fact with reference to each evidentiary conflict in the record.","start":378.094,"stop":416.82,"duration":38.73},{"text":"Now, taking the Government's position to its logical extreme, it would mean that a master would have to take each witness and take each bit of testimony to which he testified and make a finding with reference to that and say, \"I believe this, I disbelieve this, I believe this 50%.\"","start":416.82,"stop":435.814,"duration":18.99},{"text":"And the logical extreme, we submit, reduces Rule 53 (e) (2) and Rule 71A (h) to an absurdity, destroys the utility of

because if the Court will look at the extensive instructions to the Commission in this case, commencing at page 18, outlining all of the basic principles of law to the Commission and even instructing the Commission that if they desired any further instructions with reference to any question that might come up before them, they could apply for -- further instructions.","start":472.391,"stop":503.867,"duration":31.48},{"text":"There were no exceptions to these instructions by the

at all, even though the opinion of the Fifth Circuit laid us tremendously to try to justify its opinion, referring to its prosecutors against the use of a commission in a condemnation case and it was not involved.","start":516.255,"stop":539.969,"duration":23.71},{"text":"Again, the opinion seeks to assert, impliedly asserts that a master must find qualifications of witnesses.","start":539.969,"stop":549.325,"duration":9.36},{"text":"Now, we respectfully submit that qualification of witnesses is not a fact.","start":549.325,"stop":554.681,"duration":5.36},{"text":"It is a preliminary question addressed to the fact finder.","start":554.681,"stop":560.06,"duration":5.38},{"text":"One other thing that we would like to -- for this Court to clearly understand and that is this, these -- these commissions are not just referred -- they're just not picked out of thin air, they were -- they were referred to as this -- the order appointing the Commission in this case, shows they were referred to people of -- of tremendous ability that -- the -- the order of the reference says that he is an experienced
