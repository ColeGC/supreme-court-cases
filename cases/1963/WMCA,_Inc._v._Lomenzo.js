legislative apportionment.","start":8.323,"stop":20.357,"duration":12.03},{"text":"And I was suggesting that if -- if a state drew a line, in a way rationally related to one of those permissible objectives, then the apportionment would not run afoul of either my first, second or third general principle.","start":20.357,"stop":38.899,"duration":18.54},{"text":"Whether it runs afoul of the fourth principle, the one introducing a question of degree, remains to be covered, but up to this point, my argument would not condemn any apportionment aimed in such a direction, having such a function.","start":38.899,"stop":55.65,"duration":16.75},{"text":"The point I was trying to make was that those rules are fundamentally different from differentiations or classifications among voters

so forth, or the Protestant or the Jew.","start":55.65,"stop":80.207,"duration":24.56},{"text":"The latter kind -- that whole latter class when applied to political rights, including representation,

equality before the law, in four places.","start":93.082,"stop":102.394,"duration":9.31},{"text":"In the first place, I suggest that the principle that their polity, the people as a whole, knows no distinction in the political worth of one man as opposed to another, is just as fundamental a strain in our constitutional parity as the principle that it knows no distinction in political matters

man.","start":102.394,"stop":134.814,"duration":32.42},{"text":"We filed an elaborate appendix to our brief in the Maryland case, in which we show the extent to which the ideas of equal representation per capita was accepted in the constitutional convention of 1789 and in the ratifying conventions, as a principle applicable to any government, dealing directly with its own citizens and drawing its authority directly from the citizens in the 18th Century philosophy, as distinguished from a legislative body representing sovereign

elections.","start":822.713,"stop":857.11,"duration":34.4},{"text":"Let me try to make that point a little clearer again by resorting to what may seem a silly illustration, but I think these silly
