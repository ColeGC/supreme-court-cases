vote.","start":314.144,"stop":318.773,"duration":4.63},{"text":"It's done entirely secret.","start":318.773,"stop":321.469,"duration":2.7},{"text":"And the right to vote is a cherished privilege and should be enjoyed by everyone.","start":321.469,"stop":326.558,"duration":5.09},{"text":"But we must remember and we must appreciate that when a person goes into the ballot box and votes, he has the privilege of discriminating.","start":326.558,"stop":337.234,"duration":10.68},{"text":"He can vote against the candidate because of his

him because he don't like the way he talks or walks or he can vote against him because he's -- it is the incumbent, there's a lot of people that work with everybody on the office.","start":343.75,"stop":354.11,"duration":10.36},{"text":"I hope that's not true on December the 7th of course.","start":354.11,"stop":357.023,"duration":2.91},{"text":"But when a man goes into

discriminates against the other eight.","start":365.504,"stop":369.384,"duration":3.88},{"text":"So that is a privilege of voting.","start":369.384,"stop":370.969,"duration":1.58},{"text":"That is one
