say, the Court was careful to say that the protection was the protection afforded by the Fifth Amendment, and as the appellants have said, the test under the Fifth Amendment is essentially what is fair, what is reasonable.","start":3904.012,"stop":3927.172,"duration":23.16},{"text":"Is this measure a rational means to an end that Congress could entertain under the constitution or is it

Amendment, and there, as my friend pointed out, it is clear in this case as it was in the Douds case that the operation of this statute acts to inhibit the exercise of certain rights of speech and

or believe.","start":3987.838,"stop":4013.821,"duration":25.98},{"text":"In this case, as I say as in Douds, the government concedes that there is inhibition in the statute on the rights of
