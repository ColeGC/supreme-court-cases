standards and different tests applied.","start":130.092,"stop":156.197,"duration":26.1},{"text":"The basic facts in this case are very simple, not in dispute.","start":156.197,"stop":160.718,"duration":4.52},{"text":"The taxpayer is a firm named Cutting & Trimming and the dispute between us and the State of Vermont is over some $1800 which the

employer withhold taxes on his employees' wages.","start":186.223,"stop":196.8,"duration":10.58},{"text":"And the Vermont statute provides that in the event an employer fails to withhold and pay over the tax to the state, the amount of the tax shall be a lien upon all property and rights to property of the taxpayer arising upon the assessment of the tax and demand and again this is basically the same provision as the federal provision.","start":196.8,"stop":221.32,"duration":24.52},{"text":"The dates with respect to the assessment and the perfection of these liens are as

sorry October 21st, 1958 and that was occasioned by the fact that the Cutting & Trimming firm had filed a tax return for the third quarter of 1958 filling a substantial indebtednesses to the state in withholding taxes that it failed to pay those taxes.","start":231.029,"stop":255.836,"duration":24.81},{"text":"So the state on the 21st of the October assessed the taxes and made a demand and under

its lien when it brought a suit in the state court against Cutting & Trimming and the bank in which the Cutting & Trimming had funds on deposit and four days later after the seven months it served a writ of attachment on the bank and I just may interpolate to say in the government's view at that point, and at that point only that the lien of the State of Vermont acquired a sufficient degree of perfection that it would come ahead of the federal lien.","start":265.993,"stop":303.946,"duration":37.95},{"text":"But the federal lien had arisen in the interval about three-and-a-half months later,

law.","start":355.234,"stop":371.829,"duration":16.6},{"text":"The state recognizes as indeed it must that this Court repeatedly has held that federal and not state law governs the relative priority of state and federal liens.","start":371.829,"stop":383.875,"duration":12.05},{"text":"It urges, however, that despite the settled opinion that the Court should reexamine this position and reach the

followed.","start":393.234,"stop":399.479,"duration":6.25},{"text":"We have developed the argument in our brief, I won't labor it here, but just like to indicate briefly why we think this is the correct rule.","start":399.479,"stop":407.072,"duration":7.59},{"text":"The federal liens of course are created by Congress in the exercise of its constitutional power to levy and collect taxes, their scope and reach widely affect federal revenues, their interpretation is important to the policy underlying the lien statute, and we therefore think it is the federal law and not the state law that one must look in determining these questions.","start":407.072,"stop":431.024,"duration":23.95},{"text":"Now, a suggestion has been made by the state that this Court's decision in the Brosnan case, a few

here.","start":461.485,"stop":466.576,"duration":5.09},{"text":"The Court was concerned because of relationship between federal liens and private liens, that to apply a state law -- to apply the federal law would result in disruption of well settled property interest and property principal, it was appropriate to defer.","start":466.576,"stop":484.353,"duration":17.78},{"text":"There is not that policy involved here.","start":484.353,"stop":486.371,"duration":2.02},{"text":"Here what we have is a basic conflict between the state on the one hand and the federal government on the other and what we have here is not a question as to the procedures which was all that was involved in Brosnan, the procedures for discharging liens but substantive question has been priority and we therefore think that that isn't the matter to which federal law control.","start":486.371,"stop":506.695,"duration":20.32},{"text":"I now like to come to the merits of the case.","start":506.695,"stop":510.489,"duration":3.79},{"text":"We start I think fairly with a well settled proposition which this Court has repeated many times and we asserted only last term in the
