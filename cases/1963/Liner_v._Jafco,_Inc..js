Act.","start":460.422,"stop":482.951,"duration":22.53},{"text":"And this Court held that in the Interlake case as I understand it, that the -- that the words or labor organizations defined by the Act

say that certain words that are defined in the Act should be left to the tribunal that has been chosen to administer the Act and that in this case, to say that other definitions appear in the Act should not be left to the same tribunal, and that would be labor dispute which is defined by the Act and it would also be commerce as defined by the Act.","start":529.897,"stop":560.767,"duration":30.87},{"text":"In this particular case, the complaint was that we were picketing to cause a breach of contracts between these Jafco Corporation and Rea

was added which is 8 (b) (4) (ii).","start":602.661,"stop":615.464,"duration":12.8},{"text":"And the (ii) Section says that it's an unfair labor practice in so many words, if you attempt to cause a cessation of business between one person and another is very much more broad than just causing a breach of contract.","start":615.464,"stop":631.752,"duration":16.29},{"text":"You can have a situation where two people just deal with each other without a written contract and it could be unfair labor practice.","start":631.752,"stop":638.292,"duration":6.54},{"text":"And we say that, even if we take the statements that they say are true in their bill or complaint, that it is a matter they discovered by the unfair labor practice Section of the Act.","start":638.292,"stop":653.712,"duration":15.42},{"text":"Of course, we contend that it's protected activity under Section 7 of the Act.","start":653.712,"stop":660.132,"duration":6.42},{"text":"And we say if the Court please, that the Interlake case and the Perko cases are authority for the proposition that this issue should be left to the N.L.R.B.","start":660.132,"stop":673.089,"duration":12.96},{"text":"We went ahead and actually proved the time of trial -- time came around that Rea Construction Company was involved in interstate commerce and just on this one project alone, that it purchased materials from outside State, mine to at least three times.","start":673.089,"stop":691.786,"duration":18.7},{"text":"The

ignored it and referred to those facts and referred to no decisions.","start":701.271,"stop":707.782,"duration":6.51},{"text":"We beg if the Court please that the big question that we have here today is this question of mootness.","start":707.782,"stop":717.067,"duration":9.28},{"text":"It's a question that hovers over every one of these cases where you have a construction project because at sometime, you don't know exactly when a construction project is going to be completed.","start":717.067,"stop":733.268,"duration":16.2},{"text":"If the state court takes juris -- jurisdiction which we

reasons.","start":770.167,"stop":775.626,"duration":5.46},{"text":"In the very first case that arose under the Act, my law partner Mr. King who was here yesterday and introduced me held before the Board, that case by different rounds went to the Supreme Court of Tennessee where we got a ruling which I have cited in my brief under Watson Versus Wilson, it also went the Board route through the Sixth Circuit to this Honorable Court, for we had decision or other issues.","start":775.626,"stop":807.631,"duration":32},{"text":"But the facts in that case were briefly this.","start":807.631,"stop":811.568,"duration":3.94},{"text":"They had a speculative contractor in Chattanooga who was building houses and the unions, the Chattanooga Building Trades and especially the carpenters decided to put a picket on one of these construction projects.","start":811.568,"stop":827.071,"duration":15.5},{"text":"And on the day before the 1947 Act went into effect, picketing stopped and the next day, the prime contractor went to the Board wanting a cease-and-desist order.","start":827.071,"stop":845.603,"duration":18.53},{"text":"And based upon those facts, this Court held in the first case that it could have acted on a state of facts similar to what we have here today, that the underlying dispute had not been resolved and therefore, the Board was entitled to the injunction.","start":845.603,"stop":866.724,"duration":21.12},{"text":"Now here, we come here several years later and the -- she was on the under court.","start":866.724,"stop":873.215,"duration":6.49},{"text":"We think that at this time since the matter is arguably before the Board in the first place and since the underlying dispute has never been resolved, that for that reason, the case is not moot.","start":873.215,"stop":894.223,"duration":21.01},{"text":"Another case that somewhat similar to it was a case that we did not have at the time that we order a brief which was decided this summer by this Court is the case of -- Division 1287 Street Electric and Motor Coach Employees versus Missouri and the case was written -- the opinion is written by his Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart.","start":894.223,"stop":921.846,"duration":27.62},{"text":"And in that case as we read it, there was an Act by the Governor of Missouri and they had
