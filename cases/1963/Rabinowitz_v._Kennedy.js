Government argues that Congress had that purpose and it argues it from the general congressional purpose underlying the statute.","start":1385.155,"stop":1393.855,"duration":8.7},{"text":"And it sets out at considerable length in its brief, pages 15 to 24.","start":1393.855,"stop":1399.946,"duration":6.09},{"text":"The general purpose of this Foreign Agents Registration Act and they point out quite correctly and we -- we agree with them that Congress passed this Act because they wished to force those engaged in the dissemination of propaganda on behalf of the foreign principal to register so that people who read this foreign propaganda and read this propaganda would know the source.","start":1399.946,"stop":1425.872,"duration":25.93},{"text":"And that these individuals would not be

agent.","start":1430.322,"stop":1438.172,"duration":7.85},{"text":"What is applied to this case, this argument about a denial of declaratory judgment relief because of that general theory and philosophy underlying the Act is just plain nonsense.","start":1438.172,"stop":1452.185,"duration":14.01},{"text":"In the first place, petitioners here are not engaged in any propaganda or any public relations or lobbying activities.","start":1452.185,"stop":1460.009,"duration":7.82},{"text":"In the second place, there's nothing about their representation to their foreign principal which is secret.","start":1460.009,"stop":1466.438,"duration":6.43},{"text":"On the contrary, they have stated not only by bringing this action but they have appeared in Court in numerous occasions as they

propaganda or issue by the petitioners, which they don't issue and not knowing that they -- comes from them when they have not -- there are no secrets about their representation of the Republic of Cuba.","start":1479.501,"stop":1495.804,"duration":16.3},{"text":"We say it demonstrates quite clearly and it's a -- so the demonstration that has come out even sharp -- more sharply in a recent

problem which gives rise to this present case and which has created the problem is the effort of the Department of Justice to apply the Act which was designed as you read the legislative history, the quotations and everything that the Government sets fort in its brief, it was of design to cover foreign propaganda agents who were secret about their connection with their foreign principal.","start":1511.665,"stop":1537.05,"duration":25.38},{"text":"And the Government has now taken this statute and tried to apply it in a completely different situation, has tried to apply it to

history would prove, is that the Act does not apply to the petitioners at all.","start":1549.546,"stop":1561.42,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Secondly, is their second basic position, the Government argues that the complaint fails to state an equitable cause of action.","start":1561.42,"stop":1568.867,"duration":7.45},{"text":"And they say that in essence, although we started a declaratory judgment action, the action would in effect, if the Court considers it, amount to a restraint on a criminal prosecution, and that equity will not ordinarily enjoin a criminal prosecution.","start":1568.867,"stop":1586.455,"duration":17.59},{"text":"And again, it argues at great length matters which we do not dispute.","start":1586.455,"stop":1590.556,"duration":4.1},{"text":"That is that a declaratory judgment action has to be tested by ordinary equitable principals.","start":1590.556,"stop":1595.865,"duration":5.31},{"text":"We concede that, and I think the Government believe as the obvious by making such a point to that in its brief.","start":1595.865,"stop":1602.715,"duration":6.85},{"text":"But we say that this case meets the ordinary equitable principles.","start":1602.715,"stop":1608.755,"duration":6.04},{"text":"In the first place, to meet ordinary equitable principals, you have to show that the prosecution itself will present an irreparable injury far beyond that which is normally attached to a criminal prosecution.","start":1608.755,"stop":1624.421,"duration":15.67},{"text":"Now, what are the penalties imposed here upon the petitioners if they do not register?","start":1624.421,"stop":1630.665,"duration":6.24},{"text":"They're criminally prosecuted and if they are possibly successfully convicted.","start":1630.665,"stop":1638.524,"duration":7.86},{"text":"The penalties imposed by the statute are severe we point out in our brief as many of the cases in which this Court has
