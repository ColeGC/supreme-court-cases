interim period for which an individual is entitle to restitution.","start":92.158,"stop":105.451,"duration":13.29},{"text":"Thus, if the 1952 determination marks the end of this interim, petitioner

1952.","start":105.451,"stop":121.001,"duration":15.55},{"text":"In some, the remedy of paragraph 26 in which the petitioner suit is in part at least based, is in administrative remedy and it must be

applying paragraph 26.","start":235.134,"stop":248.66,"duration":13.53},{"text":"Mr. Doolittle correctly states the position that is reflected in his brief on page 14 when he says that the critical determination that they suggest to be made as of today, 1963, relates not to whether he would have been entitled to a security clearance between 1953 and at least 1959, but whether he is eligible as of this very moment which has no relationship to whether or not he should have been entitled to a security clearance during the years in question.","start":248.66,"stop":286.822,"duration":38.16},{"text":"Now, if the justification for the Government's conditioning of monetary restitution under being a final favorable determination is that the Government should not be paying off money to a man who was a security risk.","start":286.822,"stop":302.504,"duration":15.68},{"text":"This interpretation that they suggest does not need that consideration at all.","start":302.504,"stop":308.763,"duration":6.26},{"text":"Because as Your Honors have already noted, there is no necessary relationship between a man who is today a security risk

unjustified.","start":326.004,"stop":348.309,"duration":22.31},{"text":"Now, whatever that word unjustified may mean it completely has dropped out of this case because they state that the Department
