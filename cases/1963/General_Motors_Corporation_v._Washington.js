receipts tax assessment made by the State of Washington against General Motors Corporation with respect to exclusively interstate commerce, and it challenges that assessment on two grounds, interstate commerce and due process and two points under each.","start":54.453,"stop":75.088,"duration":20.63},{"text":"Rather startling new law would be created by affirmance of this decision, the statute under which the assessments were made have been in effect for 20 years and have been as it's going on for longer than that before this issue was raised and there's no precedent for it anywhere.","start":75.088,"stop":94.745,"duration":19.66},{"text":"Reversal however, requires only the application of familiar principles denied particularly extraordinary facts.","start":94.745,"stop":103.256,"duration":8.51},{"text":"Well, the prior decisions of this Court in state tax matters indicate that there are two things that need to be kept in mind carefully, now I want to mention those before I go into the details of the facts.","start":103.256,"stop":115.362,"duration":12.11},{"text":"The first is the nature of the tax that makes a lot of difference as we look at each precedent and each set of facts, and second, as to the facts not only what was done but where it was done.","start":115.362,"stop":129.957,"duration":14.6},{"text":"This tax is one which is imposed specifically by the statute and directed to be a burden upon the vendor for the privilege of engaging in the business of making sales at wholesale and measured by unapportioned gross receipts derived or related to those sales.","start":129.957,"stop":152.326,"duration":22.37},{"text":"Now, the circumstances to which a tax of that nature can constitutionally be applied are considerably narrower than the circumstances which will support any apportioned tax including, best example, and that income tax even though that's paid by the vendor also, or a consumption tax, the sales or use tax which is paid by the vendee.","start":152.326,"stop":176.764,"duration":24.44},{"text":"Now, the facts here are that, although constitutionally from constitutional point of view very simple, they're quite detailed.","start":176.764,"stop":184.475,"duration":7.71},{"text":"General Motors Corporation is a Delaware Corporation that's qualified to do business in

financing.","start":263.988,"stop":270.484,"duration":6.5},{"text":"The tax on all of the transactions that are related in any way to those offices, has been paid without dispute and is not here
