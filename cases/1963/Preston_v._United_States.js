Kentucky to mean that in the case of a misdemeanor such is a violation of a vagrancy or a loitering statute, that the arrest maybe validly made if done in good faith, with probable cause to believe and where the probable cause derived from his senses or admissions of the defendants but not third parties and I think he has some authority to this, I think it's a doubtful
