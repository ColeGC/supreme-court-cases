justice, members of the Court.","start":51.702,"stop":55.018,"duration":3.32},{"text":"I might say I just want to refer to the facts very briefly although we have gone to them in detail in our brief.","start":55.018,"stop":63.629,"duration":8.61},{"text":"In May of 1960, both of these petitioners were subpoenaed before the Waterfront Commission of the New York Harbor, which is a bistate commission having been set up by the statutes of the State of New York and New Jersey and a compact that was approved by Congress for the purpose of investigating Waterfront crime or crime in New York harbor involving interstate and foreign commerce among other things liasioning the individuals to work on the peers.","start":63.629,"stop":98.838,"duration":35.21},{"text":"At the time both of these petitioners were subpoenaed to testify in May of 1960, they were -- the commission was asked for appraisal as to the purpose and they were advised that they were investigating a strike or stoppage.","start":98.838,"stop":115.33,"duration":16.49},{"text":"Counsels for both of these petitioners at that time urged that the commission was without jurisdiction in that preemption applied and the field had been preempted by the federal government.","start":115.33,"stop":128.799,"duration":13.47},{"text":"The commission at that time then proceeded to secure an order of show cause in our State Court, Superior Court why they shouldn't be held of contempt and in the application and in the order of show cause they then alleged and gave the background of the Waterfront Commission, why it had been set up and the various investigations that had taken place in New York and in New Jersey prior to the setting up of this commission and the passage of the statute showing that there had been crimes committed in the state and foreign commerce and there were racketeering and things of that nature, thefts, pilferage, and so forth, and that they had a right to investigate of this particular stoppage in strike because it involved a chief security officer that was employed by the American Export Line.","start":128.799,"stop":176.208,"duration":47.41},{"text":"That was the first general appraisal that these petitioners had that the commission was then seeking to investigate a crime or crimes.","start":176.208,"stop":185.236,"duration":9.03},{"text":"Because prior to that time they were asked by counsels specifically whether or not they were investigating a crime, the answer was they didn't know or whether it was purely a labor dispute.","start":185.236,"stop":196.561,"duration":11.33},{"text":"The petitioners were found guilty by the Superior Court in New Jersey and the decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court.","start":196.561,"stop":205.44,"duration":8.88},{"text":"The Supreme Court had held in that case that the field had not been preempted and that the as far as the appraisal was concerned, they were apprised at the time of the trial in a Superior Court of the decision of the Waterfront Commission.","start":205.44,"stop":222.822,"duration":17.38},{"text":"We then sought to appeal and apply for a writ of certiorari petition, or petition of writ of certiorari in this Court had been denied.","start":222.822,"stop":232.103,"duration":9.28},{"text":"Fact is the Supreme Court of State of New Jersey held that the Devo case was dispositive on the issue.","start":232.103,"stop":238.683,"duration":6.58},{"text":"The petitioners were then called back, were then proceeded to go back into the Superior Court to comply with the order and might I say in that contempt they were sentenced to jail until they answered the questions and to pay a $50 fine.","start":238.683,"stop":254.721,"duration":16.04},{"text":"They then proceeded and paid the $50 fine and were directed by the Court to appear before the Waterfront Commission to respond.","start":254.721,"stop":263.203,"duration":8.48},{"text":"They did appear on October 3rd and at that time when they were interrogated, counsel for the petitioners and I represented them there at that time as one of a counsels, we asked specifically for an appraisal, pertinence and we were advised that we were sufficiently apprised in the previous proceedings and that the purpose was the same purpose as heretofore as alleged in the moving papers in the State Courts that they were investigating and these papers indicated investigation of crime and racketeering.","start":263.203,"stop":296.121,"duration":32.92},{"text":"The petitioners then asserted their constitutional rights and statutory rights, and the hearing officer then stated for the purpose of record, some 25 times it appears on that October 3rd date, that he recognized their rights to assert the constitutional privilege and the statutory privilege and the next morning petitioners appeared before the Superior Court and they were purged of the contempt.","start":296.121,"stop":323.327,"duration":27.21},{"text":"The court had held that they had satisfied the order and upon the payment of the fine, which still remained, they were released.","start":323.327,"stop":333.889,"duration":10.56},{"text":"The Waterfront Commission at that time said they didn't want the case to close up because they contended that they wanted to consider whether or not they were going to then grant immunity.","start":333.889,"stop":345.63,"duration":11.74},{"text":"This is also said at the end of the interrogation on October 3rd, so up until that point we had no thought that there was any intention to try to confer some sort of an immunity in this case because of the period clearly in the interrogation on October 3rd, that the Waterfront Commission recognized the use of the constitutional provision here and the statutory provision and fact the Fifth Amendment had been used and also due process was argued at the time on October 3rd.","start":345.63,"stop":377.502,"duration":31.87},{"text":"When it appeared on October 4th

federal government” and the history of the statute as far as the legislation is concerned, was an indication by the legislature that they were taking into consideration the Hoffman case and they were making the rule as broad as it was intended in the Hoffman case.","start":393.891,"stop":417.502,"duration":23.61},{"text":"When we appeared in -- on October 4th the court had held that these -- as I indicated before that these witnesses had purged themselves of contempt and when the Waterfront Commission has said well we would like to consider whether or not we are going to grant immunity here, the court said specifically I am not concerned with what you may do that maybe another matter, these people have met the order of the court and they are discharged.","start":417.502,"stop":442.526,"duration":25.02},{"text":"We read in the papers shortly thereafter that they were going to grant some sort of immunity and then we proceeded to apply for a quashing of the subpoena, well we read this in the paper because we felt at that time there could be no such thing as immunity under these circumstances.","start":442.526,"stop":456.9,"duration":14.37},{"text":"Before the return, they have notice to motion for the quashing of the subpoena that Waterfront Commission had ordered the petitioner to appear.","start":456.9,"stop":464.005,"duration":7.11},{"text":"Well, they found themselves to be twitched in between, so we appeared, petitioners appeared and then they had some sort of a new form of hearing, it was a public hearing.","start":464.005,"stop":474.813,"duration":10.81},{"text":"They called that a public meeting in which the commissioners --the designees rather sat in open hearing, an open meeting, and proceeded to this hearing by indicating that they were now going to question both these petitioners on a matter that they had heretofore, questioned them on October 3rd they were asked for an appraisal.","start":474.813,"stop":497.261,"duration":22.45},{"text":"And the decision of the commission was well you have been sufficiently apprised in the proceedings that have taken place heretofore and were resting on that.","start":497.261,"stop":505.345,"duration":8.08},{"text":"They were asked specifically this question, will you please produce an order so that we would know the scope of this investigation by this commission, how far, where you are going into, what appeals, and they refused.","start":505.345,"stop":520.7,"duration":15.36},{"text":"There was no indication whether that such an order existed, or didn't exist, or whether wasn't, until this day we don't know or whether or not there was such an order by the commission for this investigation.","start":520.7,"stop":532.244,"duration":11.54},{"text":"The petitioners were then – then objection was made on the ground of due process, the failure of proper appraisal.","start":532.244,"stop":539.109,"duration":6.87},{"text":"However, they continued and the petitioners asserted the privilege of – and specifically stated that they were stating the Fifth Amendment by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment in this application and directly the Fifteenth Amendment because this was a bistate agency engaged in the investigate -- crime in interstate and foreign commerce.","start":539.109,"stop":564.06,"duration":24.95},{"text":"Counsel then indicated for the commission or might I say one of the designees was also counsel for commission, my -- Mr. Sirignano was sitting then in place of the commissioner, indicated that they were going to grant the immunity

Krieger","textObjs":[{"text":"Pardon me, Fifth, Fifth Amendment, I am sorry Fifth Amendment, I said Fifteenth, pardon me, well Fifteenth I'm sorry, that was specifically said for and in fact the counsel for the commission Mr. Piagra who appeared at that time interrogating said specifically we understand that you are alleging the Fifth Amendment.","start":578.765,"stop":605.064,"duration":26.3},{"text":"Then counsel said, we are now giving you this form of immunity having given notices to prosecutors in Hudson County and New Jersey and in New York County and the attorney generals of both states which is a from the statute itself provides some form of immunity on such notice.","start":605.064,"stop":621.98,"duration":16.92},{"text":"Whether or not that is proper or I'm not going into but it seems so much fast, it's not a self executionary statute of immunity, it's one that the commission can decide whether or not they are going to give or not give.","start":621.98,"stop":633.274,"duration":11.29},{"text":"However, we objected to it and we also then objected that the immunity was not broad enough.","start":633.274,"stop":640.617,"duration":7.34},{"text":"The immunity was not as broad as the privilege and so far as the state is concerned because the state's evidence that we typically provides and this is one state that thought ahead and said that a privilege maybe asserted if it involves any Federal incrimination on 1960 Act and then so far as the Fifth Amendment is concerned by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment and counsel then indicated to the petitioners that they would not be charged or they could not be charged with any crime that they were testifying as to and they were immune from prosecution.","start":640.617,"stop":678.744,"duration":38.13},{"text":"Counsel was then asked specifically are you advising these petitioners that they cannot be prosecuted for any Federal offense in this matter and then they took a position for the first time, oh no, we don't have to do that, it's not necessary that we do that, the immunity doesn't have to go to any Federal offense.","start":678.744,"stop":698.114,"duration":19.37},{"text":"The petitioners was then directed further to answer and this interrogation continued on insofar and continued to a point where petitioners were interrogated as to whether or not they were still engaged in this type of crime.","start":698.114,"stop":713.305,"duration":15.19},{"text":"It probably appeared that during this -- during this investigation the same Waterfront Commission had filed in one of their own proceedings, a charge against the some them in which they named both of these petitioners as coconspirators in that matter involved in this illegal act.","start":713.305,"stop":733.721,"duration":20.42},{"text":"They then proceeded immediately to go ahead with a note of show-cause for contempt allover again and directed the counsel to do so, we then proceeded in court and there, there was an argument in court.","start":733.721,"stop":745.037,"duration":11.32},{"text":"At the time of the argument, we, prior there too had served this motion to quash subpoena which was retainable on the same date as the order show-cause for contempt and we also served upon them a demand for bill of particulars and we served upon them a demand for interrogatory and a demand for jury trial, reserving the right for admissions triage and so forth.","start":745.037,"stop":768.197,"duration":23.16},{"text":"The order of show-cause merely maybe turned upon whether or not they should or should not be held for contempt, but the petitions filed said, requested and prayed that they be held the both civil and criminal contempt, but the order to show-cause did not.","start":768.197,"stop":781.443,"duration":13.25},{"text":"On the returning date of this order to show-cause, we first proceeded to argue the question of law, because it was our contention and we also joined the motion to quash that the immunity was not as broad as a privilege and therefore there should a disposition on the motion and if the motion is disposed off in our favor that would end the case.","start":781.443,"stop":806.008,"duration":24.57},{"text":"We continued to argue at length on the questions of law and during the argument some questions came up as this taking of testimony and through out the record it appears that I argued that matter in which I stated to the court that at the time of the trial we will develop certain factors and the court for the first time and during this argument said, oh there will be no trial and there will be no testimony taken.","start":806.008,"stop":828.834,"duration":22.83},{"text":"We are going to dispose over this now.","start":828.834,"stop":832.099,"duration":3.27},{"text":"We had gotten to the point where and to avoid any question because in the briefs to the Waterfront Commission they had indicated that we haven't pinpointed any particular Federal offenses and we have one case in the State of New Jersey, Vaitauer, in which there have been some question by the Supreme Court that a witness must pinpoint the area in which he could incriminate himself.","start":832.099,"stop":852.048,"duration":19.95},{"text":"And I had offered proof on that question so that there could be no question about that so that there could be no argument later on, there was no proof of it and finally the next day the court said well I will hear you on one question only and from which I've put in some proof on the one the one question so far as incrimination is concerned, a Federal incrimination and then we offered a various proofs insofar as (Inaudible) interstate commerce had to be involved.","start":852.048,"stop":875.267,"duration":23.22},{"text":"We submitted a brief which was incorporated part of the record involving conspiracy interstate commerce, interference with interstate commerce, civil rights and things of that nature and persons right to hold the job and things of that nature.","start":875.267,"stop":888.05,"duration":12.78},{"text":"The court then disposed off the case by holding the defendants guilty -- or petitioners guilty of both criminal and civil contempt and sentenced them to 30 days in the County Jail, $50 fine and to remain confined until they answered these specific questions that was set forth in the order.","start":888.05,"stop":904.633,"duration":16.58},{"text":"We appealed to the Supreme -- we appealed appellate division and the Supreme Court listed the case.","start":904.633,"stop":909.506,"duration":4.87},{"text":"And at the time of the argument before the Supreme Court in this opinion various questions were raised and the Supreme Court first held that as far as privilege is concerned, as far as the waiver is concerned, as far as immunity (Inaudible) that the immunity didn't have to be as broad as to cover Federal incrimination.","start":909.506,"stop":930.474,"duration":20.97},{"text":"In (Inaudible) there was this positive of the issue and the argument insofar as preemption is concerned they held that that had been disposed of the previous case and it was no longer before the court.","start":930.474,"stop":942.401,"duration":11.93},{"text":"As far as jury trial is concerned the court held as far as that was concerned, that was discretionary with the Judge as to whether or not they should be.","start":942.401,"stop":948.913,"duration":6.51},{"text":"What became so obvious and the court in it's opinion will indicate that we had no trial that they reversed the criminal contempt sent that back, made the judgment to read that the petitioners would be confined to jail and pay the fine of $50 until they had purged themselves but the fine would remain however.","start":948.913,"stop":971.697,"duration":22.78},{"text":"Now, we respectfully submit if Your Honors please, if the Court pleases, that we have an agency here and this is somewhat different poppy in many of the cases that came before this Court heretofore, we have an agency that's engaged in investigating crime in interstate and foreign commerce, no question about that, that's the job, both states gave them to do and that's what they were doing.","start":971.697,"stop":998.079,"duration":26.38},{"text":"Now it's some form of agency I don't, would say an interstate commerce (Inaudible) Federal agency if you want to call it such, if possible, because in that statute they have a right to get Federal funds and if they get Federal funds they have certain duties there in, and we respectfully submit in this case that the Fifth Amendment applies because it is engaged in interstate commerce, engaged in crime -- engage in investigation of crime in interstate commerce, the Fifth Amendment applied by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment, they have just considered an agency only at the state of New Jersey and New York.","start":998.079,"stop":1033.483,"duration":35.4},{"text":"We further contend that there was a failure to give due process here, there was failure to have a trial on the contempt now that has been called civil contempt, frankly I can say it the civil contempt because it seems somewhat confused.","start":1033.483,"stop":1048.763,"duration":15.28},{"text":"I don't know of a civil contempt that puts a penalty on a man as well as sends him to jail.","start":1048.763,"stop":1054.191,"duration":5.43},{"text":"In fact there is, that we've (Inaudible) but someday we've got to face this other criminal contempt unless there is a reversal by this Court on a principle issue but they have a penalty to pay $50, they must remain in jail and I especially contend that this is a criminal contempt call it by any name you want to call it, any man is fined, any man has a penalty to pay that's a criminal contempt on the (Inaudible) because he stays in jail until he pays his penalty, as well as answering the questions.","start":1054.191,"stop":1081.596,"duration":27.4},{"text":"However, the question of double jeopardy is not before this Court.","start":1081.596,"stop":1084.928,"duration":3.33},{"text":"We respectfully contend that the statute of the State of New Jersey applies here.","start":1084.928,"stop":1089.48,"duration":4.55},{"text":"Now I know this Court will not consider a determination made by a state Court insofar as interpretation of it's own statutes.","start":1089.48,"stop":1098.551,"duration":9.07},{"text":"In this case and here is how the Supreme Court got around this case insofar is that Privilege Act of 1960, they said the Privilege Act of 1960 didn't repeal immunity, didn't repealed the immunity statute of the Waterfront Commission.","start":1098.551,"stop":1114.838,"duration":16.29},{"text":"Now we got this moved, immunity statute of Waterfront Commission is limited to the Waterfront Commission nobody else, we have no general immunity statute in New Jersey.","start":1114.838,"stop":1121.867,"duration":7.03},{"text":"Then this 1960 Evidence Act didn't repeal that, because if they haven't said that they would have had to say that the Evidence Act applies.","start":1121.867,"stop":1129.874,"duration":8.01},{"text":"Now I respectfully submit to this Court that there was a denial of equal protection of the law here, because this is the only class and group of people that haven't got the advantage of that Evidence Act, because of the Waterfront Commission, now there is nothing in a Waterfront Commission Act that recognizes the right of privilege.","start":1129.874,"stop":1157.304,"duration":27.43},{"text":"I respectfully submit that when the Evidence Act of 1960 was passed, they repealed the previous Privilege Act, specifically repealed the previous Privilege Act.","start":1157.304,"stop":1174.982,"duration":17.68},{"text":"Now if and that is so the statute of 1960 repeals the previous Privilege Act and if 1960 Act of Privilege doesn't apply to these people then there is no Privilege Act in the state of New Jersey that applies to these petitioners who are connected directly or indirectly with the Waterfront Commission already investigation by the Waterfront Commission, there is no Privilege Act in the state of New Jersey applying to this class of people.","start":1174.982,"stop":1204.239,"duration":29.26},{"text":"As a class they are eliminated from a privilege act in the State of New Jersey, we have no constitution provision in New
