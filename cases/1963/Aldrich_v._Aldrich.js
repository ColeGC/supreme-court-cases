Court of Appeals of West Virginia, in deciding the case and refusing to give a full faith and credit to the Florida decree, said that the Florida decree made a wrong decision in the

matter.","start":245.463,"stop":253.29,"duration":7.83},{"text":"But the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia proceeds to review the statutes and decisions of the State of Florida and rule that the Florida court has made a wrong decision.","start":253.29,"stop":266.096,"duration":12.81},{"text":"In doing so, the Court of West Virginia had found something like this in the decisions of the State of Florida.","start":266.096,"stop":280.264,"duration":14.17},{"text":"\"The alimony,\" this is the statement that often made in the Florida decree, \"Alimony generally ends with the death of the husband.\"","start":280.264,"stop":289.907,"duration":9.64},{"text":"Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that alimony ends with the death of the husband.","start":289.907,"stop":295.884,"duration":5.98},{"text":"We contend that the trial court, when it goes into the facts of the case, the needs of the wife, the amount of property that the husband has and possibly the -- the fault or wrong of the parties and a lot of parties that -- the part that the wife plead in acquiring the property still has a right to adjudicate alimony and make the same lien against the husband's estate.","start":295.884,"stop":325.785,"duration":29.9},{"text":"A court also in West Virginia cited a case of (Inaudible) in which the Supreme Court of Florida had ruled that alimony would not be paid after the death of the husband.","start":325.785,"stop":342.622,"duration":16.84},{"text":"But in that case, there were peculiar circumstances in it.","start":342.622,"stop":346.179,"duration":3.56},{"text":"The court of -- in Florida, and that was an appellate court only of -- gave this decision, not the Supreme Court of Florida, held that -- that the husband shows estate would be liable for a certain amount of alimony for week in the event he died before the wife.","start":346.179,"stop":363.735,"duration":17.56},{"text":"The court also -- the trial court had awarded a permanent sum, a -- a substantial sum and that was done under a statute of -- of Florida which said that, \"In any award of permanent alimony, the court shall have jurisdiction to award periodic payments or in a payment in a lump sum.\"","start":363.735,"stop":389.523,"duration":25.79},{"text":"Now, the Supreme -- the court of Florida in that case had awarded a substantial lump sum to the wife and intended also to make alimony payable out of the husband's estate and -- after his death.","start":389.523,"stop":402.034,"duration":12.51},{"text":"And the -- the court in Florida merely said this, said the wife couldn't get both if she took the lump sum, then any attempt to put alimony against the husband's estate was void.","start":402.034,"stop":416.75,"duration":14.72},{"text":"That was the -- of course, she has no application whatsoever to our case here.","start":416.75,"stop":421.9,"duration":5.15},{"text":"The Supreme Court of Florida -- I mean the Supreme Court of West Virginia used that to defeat Mrs. Aldrich's claim for alimony out of the husband's estate.","start":421.9,"stop":434.766,"duration":12.87},{"text":"Now, this matter of making alimony or claim against the husband's estate is done in West Virginia.","start":434.766,"stop":443.858,"duration":9.09},{"text":"The decisions of West Virginia, we have two decisions of West Virginia and that support that proposition.","start":443.858,"stop":450.304,"duration":6.45},{"text":"It couldn't be said that the -- the Florida decree was repugnant to the laws of West Virginia and therefore, it wouldn't be enforced.","start":450.304,"stop":461.302,"duration":11},{"text":"It was simply this.","start":461.302,"stop":462.998,"duration":1.7},{"text":"A -- a West Virginia court undertook to review the decisions of the State of Florida, the decision of the Florida court in this particular case of Aldrich versus Aldrich and in so doing, held that -- dismissed our complaint and held that alimony would not be payable out of the husband's estate.","start":462.998,"stop":485.467,"duration":22.47},{"text":"And consequently, the other cases -- the other matters in our case went out of the window, of course, if they had no claim for alimony, then we had no right to complain about the wrongful and fraudulent conveyances.","start":485.467,"stop":498.903,"duration":13.44}]},{"speakerName":"Arthur J.
