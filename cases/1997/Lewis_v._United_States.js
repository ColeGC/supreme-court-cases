I agree with you, but once the Assimilative Crimes Act was adopted initially in approximately 1825, it was because Congress at that particular point in time had not taken a very proactive role in adopting criminal statutes, so what happened was, you'd have a person commit an act or a criminal... or a crime on a military reservation or in the territories and then be able to flaunt and get away with it.","start":177.506,"stop":201.031,"duration":23.53},{"text":"So as Justice Story has been noted to say, that necessity... in fact, he was one of the authors of part of the Assimilative Crimes Act, along with Daniel Webster, in saying that we have to allow these crimes to be punished and close... my words, close the loopholes or fill the gap.","start":201.031,"stop":216.713,"duration":15.68},{"text":"There is great sentiment to apply State law on these reservations.","start":216.713,"stop":220.696,"duration":3.98},{"text":"However, Congress has spoken.","start":220.696,"stop":222.517,"duration":1.82},{"text":"In 18 U.S.C. section 13, which I have at page 5 of my brief, the original brief, it says, whoever is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress.","start":222.517,"stop":237.916,"duration":15.4},{"text":"So in times past, and in this particular case before 1909, when there was no Federal murder statute, clearly the Government would have been faced with a proposition that it couldn't prosecute for murder, so obviously they had to assimilate the State crime and say we can't allow you to get away with this, and so we'll take the State crime, and by section 13, it becomes a Federal crime and we prosecute it.","start":237.916,"stop":260.851,"duration":22.94},{"text":"I think in this particular case we get to the point of whether the particular act is made punishable by an enactment of Congress, and I think that the statutes are clear again.","start":260.851,"stop":272.298,"duration":11.45},{"text":"Congress has adopted the Federal murder statute at 18 U.S.C. section 1111, which you'll find at page 5 and 6 of my brief.","start":272.298,"stop":281.014,"duration":8.72},{"text":"This statute clearly sets forth a comprehensive scheme of murder.","start":281.014,"stop":285.569,"duration":4.56},{"text":"As in most States, there's a difference between first degree and second degree murder.","start":285.569,"stop":289.619,"duration":4.05},{"text":"Congress has done the same thing.","start":289.619,"stop":291.332,"duration":1.71},{"text":"Congress has found that there would be first degree murders, which are generally murders, or killing of human beings with malice aforethought, but also premeditated murders such as poison, lying in wait, or again they have another group of murders that are specifically listed as first degree murders, which is arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse, or sexual abuse, burglary, or robbery.","start":291.332,"stop":318.53,"duration":27.2}]},{"speakerName":"David H.

the statutes, and I would... if I had to concede a point, I would concede that that is more likely to be an appropriate acceptance of the way the statute should work, because under the Louisiana cruelty to a juvenile statute it covers not only cruelty but also it covers neglect, so then you have a different area than, say, the Federal assault statute, where we deal with the actual striking of someone under the age of 16 or something of that nature.","start":647.143,"stop":675.693,"duration":28.55},{"text":"But there again, we see the
