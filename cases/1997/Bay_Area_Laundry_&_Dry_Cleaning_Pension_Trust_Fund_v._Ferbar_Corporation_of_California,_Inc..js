Berzon","textObjs":[{"text":"--It doesn't run from the date of withdrawal, and if the fund does not assess the withdrawal for some period of time it runs only, as described by this court in Schlitz, as if the payment was made on the first day of the date following withdrawal no matter when they're actually made, even if it the demand isn't to make them until sometime later.","start":181.192,"stop":200.255,"duration":19.06},{"text":"So to apply these general principles to this case, there are really three factors that are the most important.","start":200.255,"stop":208.72,"duration":8.47},{"text":"The first is that the withdrawal itself is not a violation of any legal obligation, ceasing to make contributions is not the violation of any legal obligation, and that the date of withdrawal is often determined after the fact by a set of events that occur after what is later decided to be the date of withdrawal.","start":208.72,"stop":228.793,"duration":20.07},{"text":"So the date of withdrawal is really a datum in a bunch of calculations, and not a date on which an employer is supposed to do anything, and what that means for purposes of the limitations inquiry here is that if the fund had tried to sue the employer on the date of withdrawal they would have been summarily dismissed from their lawsuit because no demand had been made for payment and the employer had no obligation to pay anything.","start":228.793,"stop":254.06,"duration":25.27},{"text":"The second critical factor is that the employer does violate the statute once it fails to pay any withdrawal liability payment on the schedule that is set by the fund in the demand letter, again largely prescribed by the statute.","start":254.06,"stop":275.145,"duration":21.08},{"text":"That is the schedule and the amount both.","start":275.145,"stop":277.478,"duration":2.33},{"text":"So what we have here is sort of like a... any bill, like a telephone or a credit card or a legal bill or a hospital bill in which there is a liability that is incurred regarding facts that occur on a certain date, but until you get a bill that requires you to make a payment there's no obligation to pay, no obligation that has been breached, and no potential lawsuit until that date.","start":277.478,"stop":304.506,"duration":27.03},{"text":"And this rule is a rule that, although the employer in this case seems to take issue with it, is one that has been understood by hundreds of courts over hundreds of years, including this Court in a series of cases including Rawlings v. Ray and others.","start":304.506,"stop":321.859,"duration":17.35},{"text":"That is that ordinarily when you're dealing with a debt a cause of action accrues on a date that there is an obligation to pay the debt, and--","start":321.859,"stop":330.917,"duration":9.06}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"So under your view, I mean, there would be a separate cause of action for each instalment payment.","start":330.917,"stop":336.828,"duration":5.91}]},{"speakerName":"Marsha S.
