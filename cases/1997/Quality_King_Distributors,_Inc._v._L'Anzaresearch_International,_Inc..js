law.","start":469.57,"stop":489.198,"duration":19.63},{"text":"Section 501 simply provides for the enforcement mechanism for all of the rights, and I would respectfully suggest that, because it lists

obviously one of the key operative sections here is section 109, and 109, which is the current codification of the first sale doctrine, which is a doctrine that goes back well over 100 years in

copy.","start":509.629,"stop":538.548,"duration":28.92},{"text":"And we believe that that is about as broad language as Congress could use and in fact follows a... quite a lengthy history of broad language in the statutes, the predecessor statutes, and in the legislative history, all of which have made clear that Congress intended to say that once a particular copy that's lawfully made under the U.S. copyright law has been sold, the copyright owner's rights cease, and that's the actual language in the legislative history of the '76

think that the first sale doctrine, there is nothing in the language of the statute that suggests that the first sale doctrine was being overridden, or that Congress intended to change it, there's nothing in the legislative history where Congress was talking about changing the first sale doctrine, and we think the more natural reading of all of these sections together, including section 501, the more natural reading, to try to follow the congressional intent, not the policy arguments that each side can make, not the positions that the executive branch might wish to take as a matter of policy or as a matter of bilateral negotiations, we think that the fairer way to read the actual language of Congress is the way we've set
