complaint.","start":395.689,"stop":415.331,"duration":19.64},{"text":"There is nothing in the regulatory scheme, which might enable the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commodities Exchange Commission

we have an implied exemption?","start":476.498,"stop":502.234,"duration":25.74},{"text":"And it’s interesting to note in this regard what reference can be made to the legislative history, the

here, we’re dealing with statutes which were enacted by Congress which were well-aware of the antitrust laws.","start":535.195,"stop":544.08,"duration":8.88},{"text":"And these statutes give neither to the Secretary of Agriculture nor to any other body the power to and grant an immunity from the antitrust laws, or to enforce that act immunity, nor do they give a mechanism to readdress a violation
