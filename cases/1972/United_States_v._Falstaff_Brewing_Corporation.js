Court.","start":44.481,"stop":47.743,"duration":3.26},{"text":"This is an appeal under the Expediting Act from the order of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island dismissing the Government's complaint with the antitrust laws against the Falstaff Brewing Company.","start":47.743,"stop":60.568,"duration":12.82},{"text":"The complaint alleges that the 1965 acquisition by Falstaff Brewing Corporation, the Nation's fourth largest brewer of the assets of the Narragansett Brewing Company, the largest brewer in New England violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act as amended.","start":60.568,"stop":78.252,"duration":17.68},{"text":"Like Greeley, the preceding case on the docket, it is a potential competition case.","start":78.252,"stop":84.594,"duration":6.34},{"text":"Central to the case is the need to halt and if possible to reverse the increasing trend towards concentration in the brewing industry in local markets, a trend which was both noted with concern and was the primary basis for this Court's 1966 holding in United States against Pabst Brewing Company.","start":84.594,"stop":106.16,"duration":21.57},{"text":"The market in this case is not in dispute, it is stipulated, it is the production and sale of beer in the New England area comprised of the six New England States.","start":106.16,"stop":116.835,"duration":10.67},{"text":"There is no allegation in the case at the time of the acquisition.","start":116.835,"stop":121.166,"duration":4.33},{"text":"There was any direct competition between Falstaff and Narragansett.","start":121.166,"stop":127.508,"duration":6.34},{"text":"The Government alleged rather that Falstaff was a significant potential competitor in this market that the market was concentrated and becoming increasingly so and that the net effect of its elimination as a potential competitor therefore substantially lessened competition within the meaning of Section 7.","start":127.508,"stop":149.128,"duration":21.62},{"text":"More particularly, the Government alleged that Falstaff had the incentive to enter -- it had the financial capability to enter.","start":149.128,"stop":157.02,"duration":7.89},{"text":"It had reasonable prospects for a successful de novo or toe-hold entry.","start":157.02,"stop":164.041,"duration":7.02},{"text":"The District Court relying on two findings dismissed the Government's complaint.","start":164.041,"stop":170.255,"duration":6.21},{"text":"More specifically, the Court concluded that Falstaff's management had considered the acquisition by other means, find them unprofitable, and that therefore, the decision was made by Falstaff not to enter this market by any means other than the acquisition of Narragansett.","start":170.255,"stop":187.59,"duration":17.34}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Do the -- the complaint did not allege, did it that Falstaff was the only brewery

--","start":202.96,"stop":204.987,"duration":2.03}]},{"speakerName":"Kauper","textObjs":[{"text":"More specifically, if I'm right, the allegation and the evidence submitted would tend to indicate that it is one of the Nation's 10 largest brewers.","start":204.987,"stop":215.283,"duration":10.3},{"text":"Seven of those brewers are already in the New England market.","start":215.283,"stop":218.369,"duration":3.09}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"And two of them are way out west somewhere (Voice

significantly further west than Falstaff and they are also significantly smaller than Falstaff.","start":219.998,"stop":229.423,"duration":9.43}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"So, at least in argument you're going to say that Falstaff had superior opportunity and resources to any other brewing not already in the New England market to enter.","start":229.423,"stop":242.205,"duration":12.78}]},{"speakerName":"Kauper","textObjs":[{"text":"I believe that was the case.","start":242.205,"stop":243.368,"duration":1.16},{"text":"I don't

other hand, if the record showed there were 15 or 20 with equal access and resources of the potential competition argument would be much less than Falstaff.","start":248.129,"stop":260.757,"duration":12.63}]},{"speakerName":"Kauper","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, I think if -- if the evidence were to demonstrate that there were very large number of potential entrants, then clearly one would have to take the position elimination of one had no particular impact.","start":260.757,"stop":272.229,"duration":11.47}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"In other words, part of the potential competition theory I should suppose would be a proof that the potential entrant was -- if not unique at least one of a very small group, would it not be?","start":272.229,"stop":286.033,"duration":13.8}]},{"speakerName":"Kauper","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that essentially is correct, yes.","start":286.033,"stop":289.142,"duration":3.11},{"text":"So that its elimination had some consequence, otherwise clearly it would not.","start":289.142,"stop":295.098,"duration":5.96},{"text":"The court below, we believe misconceived standards which are to be applied in this sort of a case, more particularly in its two key holdings, we believe that it improperly relied upon subjective statements made after the fact as to what the intentions of Falstaff's management would have been at a previous point in time.","start":295.098,"stop":316.788,"duration":21.69},{"text":"Second, we believe that it failed to recognize the concentrated nature of the market in the New England area.","start":316.788,"stop":324.819,"duration":8.03},{"text":"In finding that, this particular market was “intensely competitive”.","start":324.819,"stop":331.239,"duration":6.42},{"text":"Finally, we believe it put undue weight upon certain post-acquisition evidence which tended to indicate that following the acquisition by Falstaff, Narragansett's market share declined.","start":331.239,"stop":343.4,"duration":12.16},{"text":"Let me now briefly deal with the facts.","start":343.4,"stop":346.587,"duration":3.19},{"text":"The New England beer market, first of all, is a growing market sales -- total sales increased by 9.5% during the period from 1960 to 1964.","start":346.587,"stop":358.374,"duration":11.79},{"text":"In 1960, the top eight firms in the market controlled 74% of the sales, by 1964, that figure was 81%.","start":358.374,"stop":367.972,"duration":9.6},{"text":"In 1960, the top four firms controlled 50% of the market, the top four firms in 1965, 61.3% of the market.","start":367.972,"stop":377.9,"duration":9.93},{"text":"In the seven years preceding the acquisition, the number of brewers operating plants in New England declined from 11 to 6.","start":377.9,"stop":388.439,"duration":10.54},{"text":"In short, we believe that this evidence carefully tracks the same trends which were noted by this Court in United States against Pabst Brewing Company in 1966.","start":388.439,"stop":399.476,"duration":11.04},{"text":"The increasing trend towards concentration, the decline in number of brewers is approximately the same.","start":399.476,"stop":408.44,"duration":8.96},{"text":"We also, as I indicated, Mr. Justice Stewart, the facts are indicated that there are 10 -- of the 10 largest brewers in the Nation, seven are already marketing in the New England area.","start":408.44,"stop":420.287,"duration":11.85},{"text":"The remaining three -- of the remaining three, Falstaff is clearly the largest, it is also the one most geographically proximate to the New England market although I think we would all recognize that it's not within, let's suppose, a hundred mile.","start":420.287,"stop":437.499,"duration":17.21},{"text":"The market is characterized as is the marketing at most beer by heavy promotional and advertising expenditure.","start":437.499,"stop":445.188,"duration":7.69},{"text":"The Narragansett Brewing Company acquired by Falstaff at the time of acquisition was the leading brewer in terms of sales in the New England area with approximately 20% of the market.","start":445.188,"stop":456.183,"duration":11},{"text":"It was at the time of the acquisition, a healthy firm, its profits and sales had increased substantially during the four years prior to the acquisition.","start":456.183,"stop":466.912,"duration":10.73},{"text":"It had engaged in significant planned expansion and indeed inquired -- acquired certain assets from certain other brewers during that same period.","start":466.912,"stop":475.544,"duration":8.63},{"text":"Its distribution system was primarily through independent wholesale distributors.","start":475.544,"stop":481.003,"duration":5.46},{"text":"They were not bound by contract to Narragansett, to handle Narragansett's beer exclusively and indeed the evidence suggest than in most instances they did not.","start":481.003,"stop":490.964,"duration":9.96},{"text":"The Falstaff Brewing Company, the acquiring corporation, at the time of the acquisition was the fourth largest brewer in the United States having 5.9% of the market.","start":490.964,"stop":502.308,"duration":11.34},{"text":"It at that time operated eight breweries.","start":502.308,"stop":505.731,"duration":3.42},{"text":"Most of those breweries had been acquired by Falstaff during a 20-year period.","start":505.731,"stop":511.967,"duration":6.24},{"text":"In most instance, there were small failing breweries of capacities of some hundred, two hundred thousand barrels.","start":511.967,"stop":520.506,"duration":8.54},{"text":"In each instance, Falstaff had substantially modernized those plants, had greatly expanded their capacity, and in that manner, had developed the system which made them, by 1965, the fourth largest brewer in the Nation.","start":520.506,"stop":537.097,"duration":16.59},{"text":"During the period preceding -- immediately preceding the acquisition, Falstaff's sales and profits had also expanded greatly.","start":537.097,"stop":545.747,"duration":8.65},{"text":"It was a financially healthy company.","start":545.747,"stop":548.686,"duration":2.94},{"text":"It had no difficulty in securing capital.","start":548.686,"stop":552.456,"duration":3.77},{"text":"Falstaff distributed its beer in two ways.","start":552.456,"stop":555.767,"duration":3.31},{"text":"Approximately 80% of its beer in various markets was distributed through independent wholesale distributors.","start":555.767,"stop":563.432,"duration":7.66},{"text":"Most of those distributors were non-exclusive distributors.","start":563.432,"stop":567.506,"duration":4.07},{"text":"I think the figure is something like 75% of the total wholesale distributors did not carry Falstaff's line exclusively.","start":567.506,"stop":576.641,"duration":9.13},{"text":"The balance of its beer was distributed through its own owned branch operations.","start":576.641,"stop":582.062,"duration":5.42},{"text":"Now that was true in cities where it operated breweries.","start":582.062,"stop":584.668,"duration":2.61},{"text":"It was also true in the number of cities in California.","start":584.668,"stop":588.361,"duration":3.69},{"text":"So that it was experienced with at least two types of distribution system namely the independent wholesale distributor as well as the branch distributor which it owned.","start":588.361,"stop":600.019,"duration":11.66},{"text":"So far as entry is concerned, Falstaff had conceived or perceived by -- that national breweries and you had Mr. Metzger in the previous case referred to probably the four best known international brewers, by virtue of their national status had certain competitive advantages over Falstaff.","start":600.019,"stop":620.691,"duration":20.67},{"text":"This includes the ability to advertise on a national basis and what is referred to as the so-called prestige factor.","start":620.691,"stop":628.502,"duration":7.81},{"text":"In fact, an individual who goes in to buy a can or a bottle of beer, he gets accustomed to a particular brand which he can find anywhere in the United States.","start":628.502,"stop":637.855,"duration":9.35},{"text":"In 1958, Falstaff commissioned a report to be made ahead on its future growth.","start":637.855,"stop":643.824,"duration":5.97},{"text":"That report is referred to throughout the record as the Arthur D. Little Report which was submitted to Falstaff in 1960.","start":643.824,"stop":652.829,"duration":9},{"text":"That report was designed to indicate the method of growth for the Falstaff Brewing Company in the years to come.","start":652.829,"stop":660.11,"duration":7.28},{"text":"It made a number of recommendations but I'd -- let me refer to three.","start":660.11,"stop":664.692,"duration":4.58},{"text":"First, it rather clearly and categorically stated that if Falstaff was to expand its sales, it would need to become a national brewer, but national brewer status.","start":664.692,"stop":675.548,"duration":10.86},{"text":"Second, it recommended that entry be made into new markets by the building of new brewers.","start":675.548,"stop":683.259,"duration":7.71},{"text":"Specifically, in the context of our case, it suggested that -- excuse me -- Falstaff should enter into the New England market -- pardon, the Northeastern market by the building of a new brewery, which was to be located in Baltimore, Maryland.","start":683.259,"stop":700.285,"duration":17.03},{"text":"But more generally, it concluded that building of a new brewery was more economical than entry by other means.","start":700.285,"stop":710.403,"duration":10.12},{"text":"It also indicated that distribution by Falstaff through its own company-owned outlets was more profitable to Falstaff than entry -- pardon me, distribution through the use of independent distributors.","start":710.403,"stop":725.589,"duration":15.19},{"text":"Following a receipt of that report, Falstaff began through public pronouncement and otherwise to indicate its desire to become a national brewery.","start":725.589,"stop":737.165,"duration":11.58},{"text":"Foremost among its desires was an entry into the Northeastern market.","start":737.165,"stop":743.532,"duration":6.37},{"text":"In pursuing that particular goal, it had negotiations with several other brewers before culmination of the acquisition of Narragansett.","start":743.532,"stop":755.348,"duration":11.82},{"text":"These brewers -- I think it -- must be indicated that at least in several instances came to Narragansett and not came to Falstaff and not the other way around, but there were extended negotiations with the Liebmann Brewing Company.","start":755.348,"stop":769.957,"duration":14.61},{"text":"There were extended negotiations with Rheingold Brewers.","start":769.957,"stop":773.185,"duration":3.23},{"text":"These are both brewers operating primarily or have brewing headquarters in New York -- in the New York City area but marketing in the New England area.","start":773.185,"stop":783.018,"duration":9.83},{"text":"Employees were sent to visit the plants of the Piel brewery, plants both in New York and Massachusetts.","start":783.018,"stop":789.154,"duration":6.14},{"text":"There were contacts made with other brewers in the Upstate New York area and indeed contacts inquiries made of Falstaff by several smaller brewers, at least two, pardon me, in the New England areas.","start":789.154,"stop":804.561,"duration":15.41},{"text":"Now it's in that setting that the Government contends that the acquisition of Narragansett by Falstaff eliminated a significant potential competitor from this market.","start":804.561,"stop":818.054,"duration":13.49},{"text":"Falstaff does not, as we understand it, deny that it had the capability, financial, technical capability to enter the New England market, nor does it deny at least in general -- in general that it had a strong incentive to enter the Northeastern market.","start":818.054,"stop":838.296,"duration":20.24},{"text":"It does not assert as out far as we can tell that there were any other brewers who are more likely to enter into the New England market.","start":838.296,"stop":848.734,"duration":10.44},{"text":"Its essential argument as we understand it, is that it could not enter this market other than by its acquisition of the Narragansett Brewing Company because and this was the basis defining by the District Court, statements made by its executives that it was necessary to secure a strong, viable distribution system to enter the Northeastern market and that kind of system could be obtained only through the acquisition of Narragansett.","start":848.734,"stop":881.449,"duration":32.71},{"text":"Hence, I think the issue in a large part comes down to the criteria by which one identifies a potential competitor in a given market.","start":881.449,"stop":893.503,"duration":12.05},{"text":"That is in a sense issue one.","start":893.503,"stop":896.475,"duration":2.97},{"text":"Second of all, I think it should be pointed out that Falstaff also contends that this market was in fact intensely competitive.","start":896.475,"stop":905.698,"duration":9.22},{"text":"Now I take it that the relevance of that is that if the market was intensely competitive before the acquisition, intensely competitive after the acquisition, the elimination of the significant potential competitor in and of itself would not materially hold the competition in the marketplace, and hence under those circumstances, we should not be concerned about the question whether Falstaff is such a significant potential competitor.","start":905.698,"stop":933.449,"duration":27.75},{"text":"Now in general, I don't think after the discussion yesterday we need to review in detail the theory of a potential competition case.","start":933.449,"stop":943.073,"duration":9.62},{"text":"In essence, it has two parts, one is that the particular firm, the acquiring firm in this instance was in fact likely to enter the market and that this because of the concentrated nature of the market would be pro-competitive.","start":943.073,"stop":960.189,"duration":17.12},{"text":"That is it is in fact a likely entrant.","start":960.189,"stop":963.607,"duration":3.42},{"text":"Second part of the theory says in essence that its presence as a potential competitor is likely to have had an impact on the behavior of firms already in the market.","start":963.607,"stop":977.051,"duration":13.44},{"text":"And it is that impact which is then eliminated through its entry of a brewer, particularly of the size of this particular firm, Narragansett.","start":977.051,"stop":987.88,"duration":10.83},{"text":"Indeed, in the cases decided by this Court, dealing with potential competition, there appears to be -- appears to have been more emphasis on the latter than on the former.","start":987.88,"stop":998.958,"duration":11.08},{"text":"Those cases, the El Paso case, the Penn-Olin case, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor case decided last term, all emphasize the effect which that particular acquiring firm had on the market even without actual entry, but instead by virtue of its existence, and the phrase which has come to be used is on the wings of the market.","start":998.958,"stop":1023.179,"duration":24.22},{"text":"As it was put in the panel, the existence of an aggressive, well-equipped, and well-financed corporation engaged in the same or related lines of commerce waiting anxiously to enter an oligopolistic market would be a substantial incentive to competition.","start":1023.179,"stop":1039.444,"duration":16.26},{"text":"Now that's the basic theory.","start":1039.444,"stop":1041.865,"duration":2.42}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
