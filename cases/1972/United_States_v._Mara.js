Lacovara","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.","start":29.057,"stop":32.226,"duration":3.17},{"text":"This case as I mentioned is the follow-up sequel to United States against Dionisio.","start":32.226,"stop":37.629,"duration":5.4},{"text":"It's also here on writ of certiorari to the Seventh Circuit, and in this case we have a slightly different factual setting.","start":37.629,"stop":46.313,"duration":8.68},{"text":"This was an investigation being pursued not by a special Grand Jury but by the regular September 1971 Grand Jury, and the Grand Jury was investigating a theft from interstate shipment and a conspiracy violation.","start":46.313,"stop":62.919,"duration":16.61},{"text":"Mr. Mara was subpoenaed before the grand jury and was directed by the grand jury foreman to give exemplars of his hand writing and his printing.","start":62.919,"stop":73.236,"duration":10.32},{"text":"And he returned -- refuse on constitutional grounds, essentially Fourth and Fifth Amendment grounds.","start":73.236,"stop":79.914,"duration":6.68},{"text":"The Government then filed a petition with the District Court to compel Mr. Mara to give the handwriting and printing exemplars and in that petition, the Government alleged the nature of the grand jury investigation which is an investigation under Section 659, Theft from Interstate Shipment and 371, Conspiracy and it alleged that Mr. Mara had been asked for handwriting and printing exemplars which the grand jury considered essential and necessary solely for the purpose of comparing his handwriting to determine whether he was the author of certain writings that were before the grand jury.","start":79.914,"stop":120.915,"duration":41},{"text":"The petition further alleged that Mr. Mara had refused to obey the foreman’s direction and refused to give the handwriting and printing exemplars.","start":120.915,"stop":132.61,"duration":11.7},{"text":"The Government also in an attempt to comply with what it understood to be the requirement of United States v. Dionisio which we were nevertheless challenging before this Court, submitted in Camera to the District Court an affidavit by an FBI agent who had testified before the grand jury.","start":132.61,"stop":150.848,"duration":18.24},{"text":"And in that affidavit as the petition alleged, the Court would determine that if there were reasonable grounds, that reasonableness must be determined for the grand jury’s demand for the handwriting exemplars.","start":150.848,"stop":165.434,"duration":14.59},{"text":"The -- that affidavit was before the District Court at the hearing on the Government’s petition.","start":165.434,"stop":172.858,"duration":7.42},{"text":"The respondent objected to the petition for the exemplar order raising essentially two grounds.","start":172.858,"stop":181.111,"duration":8.25},{"text":"First, the contention was that the Government did not have probable cause to support the application, the argument being that since the grand jury had not indicted him, it clearly did not yet have probable cause to think that he was somehow linked with the crime.","start":181.111,"stop":197.235,"duration":16.12},{"text":"And secondly, the objection was made that the Government was trying to support the petition by showing of reasonableness by submitting an affidavit that was not being made available.","start":197.235,"stop":209.024,"duration":11.79},{"text":"The District Judge ruled that an in camera submission was sufficient and also ruled that probable cause was not the standard necessary even under the Dionisio to secure an exemplar order.","start":209.024,"stop":222.888,"duration":13.86},{"text":"The respondent, Mr. Mara, was then ordered to provide such samples of his handwriting, his printing as the grand jury might deem necessary and in this case Mr. Justice Marshall the order explicitly did not make any reference I believe to the -- to any agents of the grand jury, it said to provide exemplars before and to the grand jury.","start":222.888,"stop":244.984,"duration":22.1},{"text":"There's been no objection – there was no objection at the hearing either before the grand jury or at the original hearing on that ground.","start":244.984,"stop":253.78,"duration":8.8},{"text":"After the District Court entered its order, requiring the giving of the exemplars and Mr. Mara refused in open court to give the exemplars and was committed for contempt, Mr. Mara, through his counsel submitted an application for a stay or for bond, and in that application as he has since then, has urged the contention that it was improper to suggest or to direct that the handwriting exemplars be given to a sworn agent of the grand jury.","start":253.78,"stop":287.006,"duration":33.23},{"text":"The argument is made, this goes beyond the lawful province of the grand jury.","start":287.006,"stop":291.695,"duration":4.69},{"text":"I had to anticipate, I say that the Government position on this is the same as it was in the prior case that the refusal before the grand jury was a categorical one based on constitutional grounds not based on the local of the giving of the exemplars.","start":291.695,"stop":307.79,"duration":16.1},{"text":"And both the petition and the order call only for the giving of exemplars before the grand jury, if respondent is willing to comply with that.","start":307.79,"stop":318.134,"duration":10.34},{"text":"After the District Court denied bail or stay, the Court of Appeals did release Mr. Mara on bond and when the case was argued, the Court of Appeals also asked that the FBI agent's affidavit be submitted to it in camera and that was subsequently done.","start":318.134,"stop":339.684,"duration":21.55},{"text":"The affidavit is now before this Court as a sealed exhibit, it is never been seen to the best of my knowledge by respondent.","start":339.684,"stop":348.198,"duration":8.51},{"text":"The Seventh Circuit reaffirmed its holding in Dionisio that the Fourth Amendment requires that the Government on behalf of the grand jury must make an affirmative showing of reasonableness before it can obtain an exemplar like this from a witness.","start":348.198,"stop":367.056,"duration":18.86},{"text":"The Court rejected Fifth and Sixth Amendment privilege and counsel claims for essentially the same reasons that it had in Dionisio, but it held here that it would address itself to the procedures that the Government had to avail itself in order to show reasonableness and would also discuss the substantive content of that reasonableness showing.","start":367.056,"stop":393.206,"duration":26.15},{"text":"On both points, the Seventh Circuit held that the Government on behalf of the grand jury had been deficient.","start":393.206,"stop":400.89,"duration":7.68},{"text":"On the question of the proper procedure, the Seventh Circuit ruled that in order to demonstrate reasonableness, the Government must submit its affidavit or any other proof it wants to bring to the attention of the District Court in an open and adversary hearing.","start":400.89,"stop":417.735,"duration":16.85},{"text":"So the Court of Appeals said, the respondent can have an opportunity to litigate the sufficiency of the Government showing.","start":417.735,"stop":428.876,"duration":11.14},{"text":"The Court ruled that grand jury's secrecy is not a magical incantation and was not applicable in this kind of setting.","start":428.876,"stop":438.627,"duration":9.75},{"text":"On the question of the substantive showing, the content of the reasonableness determination, the Court imposed a number of factual requirements that must be affirmatively demonstrated by the Government.","start":438.627,"stop":451.325,"duration":12.7},{"text":"These are set forth of course in the Court’s opinion which is printed as an appendix to the cert petition.","start":451.325,"stop":457.8,"duration":6.48},{"text":"The Court of Appeals stated at the outset that the Government must show that what is being conducted is a lawful, properly authorized grand jury investigation.","start":457.8,"stop":470.574,"duration":12.77},{"text":"That the investigation is probing some objective that Congress can permissibly authorize.","start":470.574,"stop":477.398,"duration":6.82},{"text":"It must also show that what is being sought is relevant to the inquiry.","start":477.398,"stop":482.819,"duration":5.42},{"text":"That’s exactly the kind of preliminary showing of this Court in Branzburg, not to mention many other cases that are cited in the various briefs has refused to require grand jury to show before it could conduct its inquiry.","start":482.819,"stop":497.264,"duration":14.44},{"text":"In addition to what it termed the showing of relevance to the inquiry, the Seventh Circuit insisted that the Government must show that the grand jury process is not being abused, and that the exemplars being sought are adequate, but not excessive to its purpose.","start":497.264,"stop":514.77,"duration":17.51},{"text":"Now that rather ambiguous formulation was amplified by the Seventh Circuit which went on to say that this meant that the Government had to show exactly with more specific detail on the FBI agent's affidavit before it had shown, what the purpose of the identification evidence was, what its connection was with the crime being investigated, what the witness's connection is between the identification, evidence and the crime might be.","start":514.77,"stop":547.816,"duration":33.05},{"text":"The Government also has to show according to the Seventh Circuit in order to obtain the exemplar that the evidence, the identification evidence is not otherwise available, again, another test that the Court explicitly rejected in Branzburg in the First Amendment context and the Court said that it would regard the grand jury process as being abused, if the Government failed to show that it was unable to obtain this material in any other way because the Court said, “Having a grand jury obtain evidence that investigators might otherwise be able to come upon is an abusive process.”","start":547.816,"stop":588.094,"duration":40.28},{"text":"We think that is also an unsupportable position, but in any event, the Court found that the showing of the Government had made in the affidavit submitted in camera did not rise to the level of showing these stringent standard -- meeting the stringent standards of relevancy non-abusive grand jury process, and direct link between the witness whose identification, whose evidence was being sought and the other materials before the grand jury.","start":588.094,"stop":617.308,"duration":29.21},{"text":"The Government promptly filed a petition to review that decision and in the interim, Judge Friendly had a virtually identical case before him in the Second Circuit, a case of United States against Doe, Mr. Schwartz, the real party in interest and in that decision, Judge Friendly taking specific note of both Dionisio and Mara, ruled that reasonableness was not the standard that had to be met as an affirmative matter in obtaining this kind of exemplar, handwriting exemplar and that in any event, if there is to be some sort of preliminary showing of reasonableness, the test certainly can’t be as burdensome and as intense as the Seventh Circuit has suggested.","start":617.308,"stop":668.316,"duration":51.01},{"text":"The bedrock position that we take in this case of course is identical to the one in Dionisio and that is that the grand jury witness is lawfully before the grand jury.","start":668.316,"stop":680.463,"duration":12.15},{"text":"Apart from a Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination, the witness has the obligation that every other citizens has to appear and to give testimony to cooperate in the grand jury's investigation even if that means giving some physical, some non-communicative or non-testimonial evidence that maybe involved in the grand jury's investigation of him.","start":680.463,"stop":703.192,"duration":22.73},{"text":"We think it's settled that the Fifth Amendment does not apply to this kind of inquiry as even the Seventh Circuit has held.","start":703.192,"stop":713.201,"duration":10.01},{"text":"We also believe that like a voice exemplar, handwriting is the kind of identifying physical characteristic that one does not have a reasonable expectation about.","start":713.201,"stop":725.37,"duration":12.17},{"text":"His handwriting is customarily made available in all sorts of casual contacts and that the grand jury is not usurping any untoward power, is not impinging upon any privacy when it asks the witness to provide it with a sample of his handwriting.","start":725.37,"stop":743.758,"duration":18.39},{"text":"Now, there's some argument in this case as in the other that giving of exemplar evidence is somehow different for Fourth Amendment purposes from the giving of oral testimony which we all concede is not covered by the Fourth Amendment because giving of exemplar evidence involves an act of the will.","start":743.758,"stop":765.92,"duration":22.16},{"text":"It involves an affirmative, physical act to create in the words of the legal aid agency's brief, to create the evidence that is being sought.","start":765.92,"stop":775.936,"duration":10.02},{"text":"Well in a sense, there is a creative process that is at work here.","start":775.936,"stop":780.534,"duration":4.6},{"text":"The witness is being asked for a voice exemplar or for a handwriting exemplar must as a matter of intellect and will, decide that he will cooperate.","start":780.534,"stop":789.501,"duration":8.97},{"text":"He must order his muscles, his diaphragm, his larynx or his hands in this kind of case, to manifest the evidence.","start":789.501,"stop":797.729,"duration":8.23},{"text":"But we cannot see that there is any constitutional difference between that kind of voluntary action, that kind of cooperation, and the kind of voluntary action or cooperation that an ordinary grand jury witness is being asked for oral testimony, he must furnish.","start":797.729,"stop":814.88,"duration":17.15},{"text":"He too when asked what do you know about the accident that occurred on 43rd street or when asked, what you know about gambling in Kell, Illinois, must go through the same cognitive process, deciding whether he will voluntarily formulate a response, whether he will order his body to provide the evidence that will intelligible to the grand jury itself.","start":814.88,"stop":839.711,"duration":24.83},{"text":"He has to create the evidence that it has to be laid before the grand jury.","start":839.711,"stop":843.798,"duration":4.09},{"text":"We think that for Fourth Amendment purposes no more -- no less than for Fifth Amendment purposes, there is no relevant constitutional distinction between the giving of oral testimony that is unprivileged and the giving of physical exemplar evidence that is not itself subject to an expectation of privacy and that we submit is this case.","start":843.798,"stop":867.323,"duration":23.52},{"text":"Now, moving along to the standards and as Mr. Justice Stewart asked in the earlier case, if the Court agrees with the Second Circuit and disagrees with the Seventh in the Dionisio decision, and holds that there is no burden on the grand jury to show reasonableness before it can expect compliance with its orders than the two issues that are before the Court in this case become academic.","start":867.323,"stop":891.067,"duration":23.74},{"text":"That is the procedure to be followed in showing reasonableness and the content of the reasonableness showing.","start":891.067,"stop":897.446,"duration":6.38},{"text":"But assuming the Court, decides that there is some obligation of this sort, we submit that in this kind of context, a current ongoing grand jury investigation, the procedure that was followed in this case is quite sufficient.","start":897.446,"stop":913.785,"duration":16.34},{"text":"That is the submission of an in camera affidavit which the District Judge can examine to determine whether it is sufficient.","start":913.785,"stop":922.586,"duration":8.8},{"text":"We think that cases relied on by the Seventh Circuit are quite at odds with the customary obligations of adversary litigation, and we also emphasize that we're talking here about a grand jury proceeding where there is a need for dispatch, there is a need for secrecy, there is a need for simplifying the proceedings, especially when as we believe is the case, there are no major constitutional values implicated.","start":922.586,"stop":954.083,"duration":31.5},{"text":"Now, the submission of an ex parte affidavit to the Court to make some legal test of it, of its sufficiency is not at all unusual in this kind of setting.","start":954.083,"stop":965.796,"duration":11.71},{"text":"It is the traditional procedure with the search warrant and it is been thought necessary that the warrant can actually be issued.","start":965.796,"stop":973.139,"duration":7.34},{"text":"This is what actually happens, the warrant is issued.","start":973.139,"stop":975.773,"duration":2.63},{"text":"Whatever privacy is involved is already invaded pursuant to that warrant before there is any opportunity to test its sufficiency and adversary proceeding.","start":975.773,"stop":986.706,"duration":10.93},{"text":"But going beyond that, the cases relied on, like Davis against the United States, the grand jury minutes case or Alderman, the illegal electronic surveillance case, talked about the necessity for an adversary hearing because the inquiry in that area was one of relevance and a relevance determination is one that turns on a lot subtle factors, which cannot always be recognized by a judge who isn’t as close to the evidence, to the investigation, to the background as the adverse party.","start":986.706,"stop":1022.137,"duration":35.43},{"text":"But even in Alderman, the Court said that they are related kinds of inquiries that can be made, and made decisively and finally ex parte by the judge.","start":1022.137,"stop":1033.077,"duration":10.94},{"text":"And in fact in subsequent cases also reported in the same volume of the US reports, Giordano and Taglianetti, the Court explicitly affirmed that District Judges acting in camera without an adversary hearing could decide such issues as whether a person had standing to complain about a Fourth Amendment violation and could even decide ex parte without any contest from an adverse litigant, that in particular electronic surveillance was legal and that determination would not be subject to any adversarial litigation.","start":1033.077,"stop":1070.856,"duration":37.78},{"text":"We consider this kind of case a fortiori because if a District Judge can make a decisive and conclusive determination that an electronic surveillance is lawful and can make that without giving any opportunity to the other side to contest that determination, we think in a much more extreme posture of an ongoing grand jury investigation, there is even less justification for demanding that the Government showing of reasonableness, if any it must make, must be subjected to full litigation.","start":1070.856,"stop":1108.555,"duration":37.7},{"text":"And in this case, I might point out what we have is an order by the Court of Appeals that the respondent in an exemplar case must be given an opportunity to test the sufficiency of the Government's showing, and I think that clearly contemplates a full trial-type or hearing-type proceeding.","start":1108.555,"stop":1131.402,"duration":22.85},{"text":"That I think is --","start":1131.402,"stop":1132.343,"duration":0.94}]},{"speakerName":"William O. Douglas","textObjs":[{"text":"Perhaps, your summary of the adversary hearings in the electric surveillance case, perhaps is a statement of a wishful affirmative of some kind because you go away beyond anything we've ever held?","start":1132.343,"stop":1149.152,"duration":16.81}]},{"speakerName":"Philip A. Lacovara","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, in the Taglianetti case which is in 394 US, the Court summarily affirmed, granted cert and affirmed the judgment holding that the District Judge acted properly in determining who had been overheard and who had not even though the defendant wanted to --","start":1149.152,"stop":1165.537,"duration":16.38}]},{"speakerName":"William O.

determination ex parte, we concede that.","start":1205.125,"stop":1208.757,"duration":3.63},{"text":"Here, we’re talking about not making a relevancy determination, but determining whether the grand jury has a reasonable basis for asking a witness to provide an exemplar.","start":1208.757,"stop":1221.464,"duration":12.71},{"text":"We think that is the kind of determination that can be made ex parte on the basis of a submission by the Government.","start":1221.464,"stop":1228.23,"duration":6.77},{"text":"This is the kind of determination that a judge who is presented with an application for a search warrant customarily makes, and he even has to make higher standard of determination than in this case, because the Seventh Circuit hasn’t said the probable cause is the standard.","start":1228.23,"stop":1244.902,"duration":16.67},{"text":"But we are content in our system to allow District Judges to make ex parte determinations of probable cause.","start":1244.902,"stop":1252.409,"duration":7.51},{"text":"And I think, even though you are correct that the Court hasn’t completely ruled on all of these electronic surveillance issues in Taglianetti as I say, the Court did affirm the ex parte procedure that was followed in the determining who had been overheard and who hadn’t, and in Giordano, which was a master order sending back for further proceedings in a number of electronic surveillance cases, Mr. Justice Stewart explicitly stating in his concurring opinion that the Court was in no way intimating that ex parte proceedings were not satisfactory to determine legality and that in fact has been the process that’s been followed in lower courts.","start":1252.409,"stop":1298.013,"duration":45.6},{"text":"So, we think then the rationale for the adversary hearing cases is inapplicable.","start":1298.013,"stop":1304.593,"duration":6.58},{"text":"On the other side, we have what is a legitimate value, and that is the value of grand jury secrecies.","start":1304.593,"stop":1311.436,"duration":6.84},{"text":"We're not talking now about attempts to keep the minutes of grand jury proceedings secret so that they can't be used to impeach a witness when he testifies years afterwards.","start":1311.436,"stop":1321.725,"duration":10.29},{"text":"We’re talking about a requirement that the Seventh Circuit has imposed, that the Government make an open showing of the current status of a grand jury proceeding.","start":1321.725,"stop":1332.659,"duration":10.93},{"text":"We think that is probably the -- as a distant from the legitimate purposes of grand jury secrecy which are designed to provide the grand jury an opportunity to pursue its investigation without providing any tip off either to the witnesses or to other people who may not be called before the grand jury about the focus of the grand jury's investigation, its progress thus far, which witnesses may so far have been called before or which witnesses may not had been?","start":1332.659,"stop":1362.257,"duration":29.6},{"text":"We think that balancing those two factors, the lack of any substantial need for an adversary litigation of a showing of reasonableness against the very considerable interest of preserving the secrecy of an ongoing grand jury combined to render the Seventh Circuit's decision wrong.","start":1362.257,"stop":1384.208,"duration":21.95},{"text":"The separate inquiry of course is one of the standard of reasonableness of the Seventh Circuit in explaining what it meant in Dionisio by listing all of the criteria that must be met here, I think it has gone far beyond with this Court has ever intimated, must be shown, certainly in any grand jury investigation.","start":1384.208,"stop":1406.237,"duration":22.03},{"text":"The Court imposes a very stringent obligation of showing relevancy which is perhaps even more intense than the similar suggestion that had been made and rejected in Branzburg and I think, it is our position for a much less justifiable constitutional objective.","start":1406.237,"stop":1426.004,"duration":19.77},{"text":"Furthermore, the requirement that the Government -- the grand jury must show the evidence is not otherwise available.","start":1426.004,"stop":1434.779,"duration":8.78},{"text":"Another criterion that was rejected in Branzburg is unwarranted, is somewhat unrealistic because at the one end, if the witness himself is agreeable to providing a grand jury -- providing a handwriting exemplar, we don’t have the litigation that we're confronted with today where the witness refuses on constitutional grounds to cooperate.","start":1434.779,"stop":1461.459,"duration":26.68},{"text":"On the hand, it's not difficult to see that using other investigative channels to secure handwriting exemplars maybe even more intrusive on Fourth Amendment interests, then is issuing court process, asking a person to come to the United States Courthouse where in secrecy he can provide an exemplar.","start":1461.459,"stop":1483.087,"duration":21.63},{"text":"It would be possible presumably for FBI agents to go to a person’s bank, or to a credit agency, or to his employer, and ask whether they will supply exemplars of the -- would be witness' handwriting.","start":1483.087,"stop":1498.439,"duration":15.35},{"text":"I don’t think that the Court should regard the lack of use of those alternatives as something the Government must affirmatively apologize for, before it asks a grand jury witness to provide exemplars.","start":1498.439,"stop":1514.651,"duration":16.21},{"text":"The level of the showing that the Seventh Circuit has imposed in this decision, I think can best be illustrated by a reading of the Government’s petition before the District Court which set out specifically the offense that was being investigated by the grand jury, which set out specifically that the grand jury thought it necessary for this witness to provide handwriting and printing exemplars so that the grand jury could determine whether he was the author of particular writings already before the grand jury.","start":1514.651,"stop":1549.942,"duration":35.29},{"text":"In that context, I think, if that showing does not meet whatever reasonableness showing the Constitution may call for, of course, we argue that it calls for none, the standard must be something quite close to probable cause which is an anomalous requirement since probable cause is the end of the grand jury's inquiry not its
