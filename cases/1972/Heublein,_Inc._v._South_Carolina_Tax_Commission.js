appellate, South Carolina claims the affirmation of it's highest court that the transfer of legal ownership has a technical title in South Carolina as required by it's own ABC Laws, is sufficient to change these inter-state transactions into intra-state transactions.","start":861.24,"stop":883.674,"duration":22.43},{"text":"The basis for this conclusion is that there is no shipment or delivery from out of state because the goods are still owned by the producer when they arrive in the state.","start":883.674,"stop":898.49,"duration":14.82},{"text":"It would hardly seem necessary to go beyond plain meaning of the Federal statute to reject this argument.","start":898.49,"stop":904.895,"duration":6.4},{"text":"However, there is, if there is any ambiguity in the Federal statute, it seems
