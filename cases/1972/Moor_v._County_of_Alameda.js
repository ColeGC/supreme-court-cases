can't pass such a law.","start":726.106,"stop":747.443,"duration":21.34},{"text":"And yet, I cannot imagine that the defendants are here even taking the position that California as a matter of its law

liability?","start":773.62,"stop":782.245,"duration":8.63},{"text":"To that, we look to 1988 and Section 1343.","start":782.245,"stop":787.196,"duration":4.95},{"text":"Now, 1988 is not a jurisdictional section.","start":787.196,"stop":790.914,"duration":3.72},{"text":"It doesn't create any cause of action, it doesn't confer any jurisdiction.","start":790.914,"stop":795.432,"duration":4.52},{"text":"Title 28, 1343 confers jurisdiction on the Federal Courts to enforce and in the words that I believe, any act of Congress which is provided for the protection of Civil Rights.","start":795.432,"stop":808.477,"duration":13.04},{"text":"Looking at Section 1988, if it's not an act of Congress, I don't know what it is and if it wasn't designed for the protection of Civil Rights, I don't know what it was passed for.","start":808.477,"stop":818.719,"duration":10.24},{"text":"It clearly falls within that language and thus there is no violation to Monroe, to 1983 or to any other Civil Rights Act provision by saying that the Federal Court can utilize 1988 in the fashion it was intended and have jurisdiction to impose that state created liability.","start":818.719,"stop":843.487,"duration":24.77},{"text":"This then brings me to the final jurisdictional contention we make, and which is perhaps the most difficult.","start":843.487,"stop":853.073,"duration":9.59},{"text":"That is, if we assume arguendo that by some quirk 1988 doesn't mean what it says, that the California Tort Claims Act cannot impose

employee.","start":853.073,"stop":877.675,"duration":24.6},{"text":"Can the county be joined as a pendent party on the pendent state claims that are otherwise before the court?","start":877.675,"stop":887.235,"duration":9.56},{"text":"Now, in a sense, we have something like and Astor-Honor type analysis because you do have a Federal Statute which can be construed along with pendent jurisdiction really to bring about the result of joining the county.","start":887.235,"stop":904.276,"duration":17.04},{"text":"But taking it just in the abstract for the moment, we're concerned here with the concept of judicial power, not discretion.","start":904.276,"stop":913.567,"duration":9.29},{"text":"There is no opinion from this Court that we are aware of that has precisely discussed the joinder of a pendent party.","start":913.567,"stop":920.919,"duration":7.35},{"text":"The trend since Gibbs has been certainly that pendent jurisdiction can be utilized, that the considerations and policy which led to its liberalization and were further liberalized in Rosado, and that if the criteria otherwise available for pendent jurisdiction, there was at least the power to join a pendent -- perhaps a pendent party.","start":920.919,"stop":948.613,"duration":27.69},{"text":"Now, in the Courts of Appeals, the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Eight Circuit Courts

parties, only claims.","start":969.412,"stop":984.493,"duration":15.08},{"text":"Taking this case for the moment, if we look to the traditional test, does the claim arise out of the nucleus of
