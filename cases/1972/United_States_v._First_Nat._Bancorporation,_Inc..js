claims that by preempting the correspondent banking business of first, of Greeley, the effect of the merger was to foreclose to the other banks in Colorado a significant important share of this

effect.","start":1165.364,"stop":1188.212,"duration":22.85},{"text":"This argument is a rather detailed and technical one.","start":1188.212,"stop":1191.702,"duration":3.49},{"text":"It turns on

indicated.","start":1214.666,"stop":1217.886,"duration":3.22},{"text":"And as I've also indicated, we think the primary issue in this case, therefore, is the standard for determining whether a firm is
