argument Mr. Chief Justice.","start":131.237,"stop":134.795,"duration":3.56},{"text":"The underlying mathematical technology involved in respondents’ claim as explained in great length in our brief and in respondents’ brief and though there is some difference in emphasis, I think there is little if any significant difference between the Government and respondents with respect to the technological nature of the claim discovery.","start":134.795,"stop":154.318,"duration":19.52},{"text":"Furthermore, though the technical background is set forth in our brief, I believe it would help

simply that it may appear and I will briefly describe here exactly what it is that respondents wish to patent.","start":161.447,"stop":174.193,"duration":12.75},{"text":"A computer is a device which solves problems involving either numerical information or other kinds of data which can be broken down by logic into numerical form.","start":174.193,"stop":185.574,"duration":11.38},{"text":"By far, the most common type of computer in operation today is the digital computer which its name implies, operates on information and data expressed the numerical digits.","start":185.574,"stop":196.778,"duration":11.2},{"text":"The basic function of a computer is quite simple after a problem has been broken down into the mathematical steps necessary to solve that problem.","start":196.778,"stop":205.258,"duration":8.48},{"text":"The computer computes the solution by actually doing the arithmetic, though it is an enormously elaborate and complicated and sophisticated device, the modern computer itself is really an extension in principle of the old adding machine or calculator.","start":205.258,"stop":220.397,"duration":15.14},{"text":"Its utility lies in its ability to perform in minutes or even in seconds’ calculations which would require years to perform by hand.","start":220.397,"stop":229.955,"duration":9.56},{"text":"Although the computer represents digits and numbers in physical forms such as for example by series of electrical pulses, the mathematical processes which the computer performs or the same which a human would perform except that they are expressed by means of the physical symbols built into the computer which uses electrical signals for example in a manner of similar to the way in which we use pencil and paper.","start":229.955,"stop":255.895,"duration":25.94},{"text":"Thus, the machine is built with the capacity that carry out a wide variety of arithmetical calculations but though the machine is built to do the arithmetic it is told to do.","start":255.895,"stop":266.015,"duration":10.12},{"text":"The machine can’t think.","start":266.015,"stop":267.662,"duration":1.65},{"text":"It cannot solve a problem unless the operator breaks that problem down into a series of mathematical or logical steps for the computer to carry out.","start":267.662,"stop":277.18,"duration":9.52},{"text":"This series of mathematical steps is the computers instructions or as it is popularly known in the trade of programming.","start":277.18,"stop":285.401,"duration":8.22},{"text":"Though some computers are built to carry out one particular program, obviously, the greatest utilities in general purpose of computers which are built to perform a wide variety of programs requiring only that the problems be broken down into logical mathematical steps and translated to a language that is compatible with the internal physical characteristics of a computer.","start":285.401,"stop":307.705,"duration":22.3},{"text":"This brings us to this precise subject of respondents’ claim.","start":307.705,"stop":313.142,"duration":5.44},{"text":"In the great majority of general purpose of digital computers, the simplest and most convenient means of physically representing numbers is in switch light alternatives such as the presence or absence of an electrical signal of pulse for example analogous and perhaps more understandable terms to the on and off the light bulb.","start":313.142,"stop":334.851,"duration":21.71},{"text":"For this reason, data used within the digital computer is ordinarily recorded not by means of our decimal number system but instead by means of the binary number system which expresses numbers and terms of only two characters 0 and 1 which can be easily correlated to the presence or absence of an electrical pulse the on or off the light bulb in which is based on powers of the number 2 rather than powers of the number 10 like our decimal number system.","start":334.851,"stop":362.816,"duration":27.96},{"text":"This two characters as I say are easily represented in the computer for example by the on and off of an electrical pulse.","start":362.816,"stop":369.889,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Now, the numbers that we deal with in our daily lives ordinarily in decimal form.","start":369.889,"stop":374.998,"duration":5.11},{"text":"Therefore, much of the data which we feed into computers has to be converted from the Decimal Number System to the binary number system.","start":374.998,"stop":383.778,"duration":8.78},{"text":"And an immediate step of this conversion process is the binary code decimal -- binary-coded decimal number system which is a combination of binary and decimal numbers and that it expresses the ordinary decimal digits in binary numerals and arranges them in the order of the decimal number system.","start":383.778,"stop":402.326,"duration":18.55},{"text":"Thus, the number 53 for example would consist of the binary representation of 5 in the left hand place and the binary representation of 3 in the right hand place.","start":402.326,"stop":414.304,"duration":11.98},{"text":"It is frequently desirable to convert binary-coded decimal numbers to pure binary form.","start":414.304,"stop":421.198,"duration":6.89},{"text":"Respondents have discovered a mathematical relationship between binary-coded decimal numbers and pure binary numbers.","start":421.198,"stop":428.609,"duration":7.41},{"text":"They have translated this mathematical relationship or theorem into a mathematical procedure for performing the conversion of binary-coded decimal numbers to binary numbers.","start":428.609,"stop":439.909,"duration":11.3},{"text":"What they are claiming in their claims are set forth to pages 3 and 4 of our brief and a numerous other places in the record is an algorithm, which the dictionary defines as any procedure for solving a given type of mathematical problem.","start":439.909,"stop":453.574,"duration":13.67},{"text":"The basic step in respondents’ algorithm as we show in the appendix to our reply brief in the appendix to our petition is the repeated multiplication in binary according to the rules of binary by the decimal number 10.","start":453.574,"stop":466.799,"duration":13.22},{"text":"Their claim would, if granted give them a monopoly over any computer program based on this mathematical relationship which they have discovered.","start":466.799,"stop":475.791,"duration":8.99},{"text":"Now, what they claim is not exactly a computer program itself, it is a generalized formulation for programs which solve the mathematical problem of converting from one form of numerical representation, binary-coded decimal to another form of a numerical representation that is pure binary.","start":475.791,"stop":495.047,"duration":19.26},{"text":"Now, let us deal with precisely what it is that the patent office and its Board of Appeals found wrong with the respondents claim.","start":495.047,"stop":503.027,"duration":7.98},{"text":"The Patent Law defines patentability essentially in two aspects.","start":503.027,"stop":507.839,"duration":4.81},{"text":"First, the statute sets forth at 35 U.S.C. 101 what constitutes patentable subject matter that is what types of invention are patentable.","start":507.839,"stop":517.719,"duration":9.88},{"text":"Then there are other provisions notably 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 which set forth conditions for the patentability of otherwise qualified subject matter and which are essentially that the invention be new, that it be useful and that it be non-obvious.","start":517.719,"stop":531.102,"duration":13.38},{"text":"The patent office did not deal here with the issue whether the algorithm claim by respondents is new, useful, and non-obvious because it found that respondents in any of it or claiming a patent or non-patentable subject matter.","start":531.102,"stop":546.097,"duration":15},{"text":"Under 35 U.S.C. 101, a patentable invention must be a “process machine, manufacturer or composition of matter.”","start":546.097,"stop":558.013,"duration":11.92},{"text":"It is fundamental axiom of the patent law, originating in the writings of Thomas Jefferson and repeated in perhaps the most consistent theme throughout the patent decisions of this Court that ideas including scientific principles or mathematical formulas, mental processes and other abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, only machines, manufacturers, composition of matter or processes.","start":558.013,"stop":584.465,"duration":26.45},{"text":"Now, how exactly thus respondents claim for an algorithm for converting binary-coded decimal numbers into binary numbers fit into this fundamental distinction between a non-patentable abstract mental procedure and a patentable process machine manufacture or composition of matter.","start":584.465,"stop":603.829,"duration":19.36},{"text":"Clearly their mathematical procedure is not a machine, manufacturer or composition as those three are all tangible products or substances.","start":603.829,"stop":612.763,"duration":8.93},{"text":"The only question is whether their claimed invention is a “process” within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. 101 and therefore the starting point of this inquiry is what is the distinction between an abstract principle or mental procedure and patentable process, the statute merely defines process at 35 U.S.C. 100 to include “process art or method” which brings in the old terminology historically used synonymous with the word “process.”","start":612.763,"stop":644.663,"duration":31.9},{"text":"Obviously, there is no sharp line between these two concepts.","start":644.663,"stop":649.479,"duration":4.82},{"text":"I need that every process and I suppose every tangible products such as a machine or manufactured article embodies and can be explained at some level in terms of abstract principles.","start":649.479,"stop":660.49,"duration":11.01},{"text":"But in the case of machines or other tangible products the patent is not granted on the idea but on the tangible object itself.","start":660.49,"stop":668.878,"duration":8.39},{"text":"So that the ideas themselves are not monopolized except in the limited tangible form in which they are embodied in the machine or manufactured product.","start":668.878,"stop":679.694,"duration":10.82},{"text":"In what circumstances then may patents be granted on processes?","start":679.694,"stop":683.982,"duration":4.29},{"text":"In other words, where have the decided cases drawn the line between ideas and patentable processes?","start":683.982,"stop":690.897,"duration":6.92},{"text":"There are essentially two lines of cases which I believe cover virtually all process patents that have been granted.","start":690.897,"stop":697.794,"duration":6.9},{"text":"First, the patent office has granted and this Court has validated patents on processes which involve the chemical or physical transformation of tangible substances such as for example processes for the vulcanization of rubber to conversion of patent to soap or the grinding of flour as it used in the several case of Cochrane and Deener.","start":697.794,"stop":718.55,"duration":20.76},{"text":"These cases and many of these are cited at pages 67 of our reply brief.","start":718.55,"stop":723.366,"duration":4.82},{"text":"Consistently emphasized, the court’s conception of a patentable process is a series of acts to be performed on a tangible substance to change of its physical properties in some way and that concept is expressly articulated in the leading decision of Cochrane and Deener at 94 U.S.","start":723.366,"stop":740.578,"duration":17.21},{"text":"The rationalities decisions is that when a process deals with the transformation of a specific substances by specific physical acts, a patent on that process has a finiteness, a forcibility of scope and a tangible quality that distinguishes it from a patent on a pure idea.","start":740.578,"stop":761.871,"duration":21.29},{"text":"The other line of cases which must be considered here in the context of process patents are those 19th century landmark cases in which process patents were granted to Mr. Morse connection with his invention of the telegraph and to Mr. Bell in connection with his invention of the telephone.","start":761.871,"stop":778.577,"duration":16.71},{"text":"The inventions claimed in these cases were series of steps performed on electric currents to produce physical reactions, in one case to print letters at a distance and in one case to produce sound at a distance.","start":778.577,"stop":791.726,"duration":13.15},{"text":"In our view of these cases are really analogous to cases such as Cochrane and Deener which involved the physical transformation of substances because the invented element in these cases was in the physical manipulation of electric signals, in our case by contrast electricity is really an arbitrary means of symbol by which numbers in mathematical operations are physically represented.","start":791.726,"stop":815.553,"duration":23.83},{"text":"The invented element in respondents claim is not in the physical manipulation of electricity but rather in the mathematical steps which the computer carries out under respondents instructions with the physical symbols that are already built-in to the computer but even assuming that the Morse and telephone cases were analogous to our case and avoiding a metaphysical argument over the tangible or intangible nature of electric pulses.","start":815.553,"stop":840.978,"duration":25.42},{"text":"These cases granted claims only on those processes which were limited by reference to a specific apparatus in envious and this is the discussed at great length in our brief.","start":840.978,"stop":851.541,"duration":10.56},{"text":"For this reason, Mr. Morse was denied a patent on his claim 8 -- his claim 8 was not limited to operation through the machinery which he have described and Mr. Morse was going rather they patent on his first claim which was so limited.","start":851.541,"stop":864.161,"duration":12.62},{"text":"And the court granted in Mr. Bells claims on processes carried out by means of the two specific apparatuses which he described.","start":864.161,"stop":871.316,"duration":7.16},{"text":"For in this cases, as in that case is such as Cochrane and Deener on which patented processes for transforming physical and chemical substances, any monopoly that might have been granted on the underlying scientific principles was limited by reference to tangible apparatus.","start":871.316,"stop":889.403,"duration":18.09},{"text":"And now finally, what is it that respondents’ claim here as a patentable process?","start":889.403,"stop":895.686,"duration":6.28},{"text":"Respondents have discovered a relationship between binary-coded decimal numbers and pure binary numbers that enables them to convert from one numerical language to another by repeated multiplication according to the rules of binary multiplication by the decimal number 10 which is expressed in binary form as 1010.","start":895.686,"stop":916.757,"duration":21.07},{"text":"The algorithm which they set forth in their claim merely translates into the language of computer programs a set of multiplications and additions by the binary equivalent of 10.","start":916.757,"stop":928.476,"duration":11.72},{"text":"Though there is no time here to explain in detail why respondents’ discovery is no more than a procedure involving multiplication by binary 1010.","start":928.476,"stop":937.648,"duration":9.17},{"text":"The Court need not except this conclusion on faith for it is fully develop in the appendix to our reply brief where we analyze respondents’ claims step by step.","start":937.648,"stop":946.503,"duration":8.86},{"text":"The respondents have illustrated their claim at great length with complicated explanations and diagrams and charts.","start":946.503,"stop":952.675,"duration":6.17},{"text":"They have not contradicted our analysis of the mathematical procedure that they claim nor had they denied that the algorithm described in their claim merely translates their mathematical discovery into the language of computer programming.","start":952.675,"stop":966.222,"duration":13.55},{"text":"When the operator tells the computer to add, he uses words like shifting, masking and storing. These words do not change the mathematical theorem that respondents have discovered into a patentable process.","start":966.222,"stop":978.366,"duration":12.14},{"text":"Any more than one changes 2+3 into a patentable process by calling it (Inaudible) or translating it into some other foreign language.","start":978.366,"stop":986.153,"duration":7.79}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
