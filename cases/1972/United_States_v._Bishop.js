Stone","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, there maybe opinion to that effect Mr. Justice Stewart, but I think all the law on lesser included offense and with this, I think that the respondent does not anywhere disagree nor did the court below disagree, the lesser included offense doctrine is very precisely designed to avoid presenting the jury with a situation in which it has to and makes a choice on a non factual determination.","start":545.532,"stop":569.409,"duration":23.88},{"text":"Let me state at the outset that though it is not entirely clear whether the government and respondent are in complete agreement as to every aspect of the general contours of the lesser included offense doctrine and I shall refer to a possible difference of opinion later on, with respect to the key issue which this case presents, I think it is quite fair to say that the government and respondent are indeed in agreement as to the general contours of a lesser included offense doctrine and disagree only as to the applicability of that doctrine to the specific felony and misdemeanor offenses set forth in Sections 7206 and 7207.","start":569.409,"stop":602.791,"duration":33.38},{"text":"Both parties agree that if on the basis of the undisputed facts in this case, the jury could not find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense without also finding him guilty of the greater offense; the lesser included offense doctrine is inapplicable.","start":602.791,"stop":617.38,"duration":14.59},{"text":"In other words, the doctrine does not apply for the purpose of giving the jury which in fact finds the defendant guilty of both offenses, discretion to and or a verdict only on the misdemeanor, that is not what the lesser included offense doctrine.","start":617.38,"stop":630.21,"duration":12.83},{"text":"It's about regardless of what maybe argued should be the jury’s function in other context.","start":630.21,"stop":637.503,"duration":7.29},{"text":"Where the lesser included offense doctrine does apply, however, is where the jury on the basis of the evidence might reasonably find the defendant not guilty of the greater offense, but guilty of the lesser offense.","start":637.503,"stop":648.982,"duration":11.48},{"text":"Consequently in this case, there must be a disputed factual matter which if resolved by the jury in a certain way could render the defendant innocent of the Section 7206 felony, but guilty of the Section 7207 misdemeanor.","start":648.982,"stop":663.481,"duration":14.5},{"text":"Now, it is undisputed here that the allegedly fraudulent documents were made and subscribed by the defendant under penalty of perjury, so that that basic distinction in these two statutes is not part of the factual, underlying factual dispute of this case.","start":663.481,"stop":677.856,"duration":14.38},{"text":"What respondent does argue and this is the key problem in the case is that Section 7206 uses the word willfully in a sense different from the way that that word is used in Section 7207.","start":677.856,"stop":691.553,"duration":13.7},{"text":"That the standard of willfulness necessary to support conviction of the felony is greater than that necessary to support conviction of the misdemeanor and consequently, that the jury could reasonably find that the defendant was innocent of the felony, but guilty of the misdemeanor on a lower standard willfulness.","start":691.553,"stop":709.306,"duration":17.75},{"text":"So that his position depends essentially upon reading the word “willfully” in Section 7206 to imply a higher standard of culpability, if you will, a more evil motive in that same word implies in the next Section 7207.","start":709.306,"stop":723.961,"duration":14.65},{"text":"And in spite of a usual presumption that the same word would not be used differently in two consecutive sections of the code defining very closely related offenses in a different manner, there is some superficial appeal to this argument as I have stated earlier for indeed, it may appear strange at first glance that these two Sections punish closely related offenses in a different manner, unless there is a higher degree of culpability in some way necessary to support a more severely punished offense, that is the felony.","start":723.961,"stop":757.445,"duration":33.48},{"text":"And as I said, I think it’s perfectly clear that what that distinction is based upon is a historical distinction with some validity I think in terms of reality between fraudulent submission of a document under penalty of -- signed under penalty of perjury and simply a document which is not signed which is handed over to an official with the government in administrative capacity.","start":757.445,"stop":782.515,"duration":25.07},{"text":"Now, having dealt with the reason why this immediate anomaly is really only superficial, let me turn to what I suggest is really the overwhelming reason and the overwhelming way in which respondent’s argument that willfully in Section 7207 means something less than it does in Section 7206 is plainly contradicted by the language of these two statutory provisions.","start":782.515,"stop":807.364,"duration":24.85},{"text":"Section 7206, the felony statute requires that the defendant willfully file a document which “he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material manner.”","start":807.364,"stop":820.73,"duration":13.37},{"text":"Section 7207, the misdemeanor statute requires that the defendant willfully file a document “known by him to be fraudulent or false as to any material matter.”","start":820.73,"stop":833.087,"duration":12.36},{"text":"It is difficult to understand on what basis the Court below could have concluded and respondent can argue here in this Court that a statute which hinges liability on a finding merely that defendant did not believe the documents to be true could imply a greater degree of willfulness than does a statute which hinges liability on a finding that the defendant knew in fact that the documents were false and fraudulent.","start":833.087,"stop":857.466,"duration":24.38},{"text":"Indeed, if either of these Sections implies a higher standard of willfulness or evil motive, it must be the misdemeanor statute which requires knowledge that the documents at issue are false.","start":857.466,"stop":868.846,"duration":11.38},{"text":"Now, respondent argues in his brief without explaining the basis of his argument that these two formulations of the defendant’s state of mind are basically the same thing, i.e. that not believing the documents to be true and knowing them to be false are really not meant to imply meaningful distinction, and I think there is a rather significant irony to his arguing this because he contends on the one hand that two very differently worded phrases implying to the average reader quite a different meaning and I think meaningful in many criminal statutory contexts, that these two very differently worded phrases used in connection with closely related offenses in consecutive statutory sections are intended to mean the same thing.","start":868.846,"stop":915.538,"duration":46.69},{"text":"While on the other hand, he argues that the word “willfully” also used in an identical manner, the same word used identically in these two provisions means something different in each of these two provisions and I think that that’s a rather strained version of statutory interpretation.","start":915.538,"stop":931.656,"duration":16.12}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, he does have the Court of Appeals going for

also involved, but I think what he had asked for in Sansone was a charge that instead of the felony, he could be charged with either of two misdemeanors, but in any event, I don’t think that’s important for our purposes here because the key issue in the Sansone is that the court denied him a lesser included offense charge and stated quite specifically that at least with respect to the standard of willfulness that the standard of willfulness in both the felony 7201 and the very misdemeanor at issue here required some sort of willful knowledge and evil intent and it's quite, the

capriciousness.","start":1180.545,"stop":1234.797,"duration":54.25},{"text":"Furthermore, I think that the Sansone opinion which was really not dealt with by the Ninth Circuit in a meaningful way precludes the Ninth Circuit’s across the board holding that the standard of willfulness in tax misdemeanors is necessarily less than it is for tax felonies because Sansone said that the standard of willfulness with respect that tax misdemeanor, the one at issue here and the tax felony at issue there, were indeed exactly the same.","start":1234.797,"stop":1263.361,"duration":28.56},{"text":"Finally, we make an alternative argument that is related in several respects to our contention that the misdemeanor in Section 7207

itself.","start":1263.361,"stop":1283.347,"duration":19.99},{"text":"This is a slightly different argument though based upon many of the same underlying reasons.","start":1283.347,"stop":1288.292,"duration":4.94},{"text":"At common laws, we point out in our brief, the lesser included offense doctrine was restricted to situations in which the

charged.","start":1308.453,"stop":1325.206,"duration":16.75},{"text":"Now, there maybe in some jurisdictions have allowed slight deviation from that rule and respondent implies in his brief that he

applicable here.","start":1357.219,"stop":1365.29,"duration":8.07},{"text":"For even if contrary to our contention, the Court were to find that the word “willfully” in Section 7206 means something more than it does in Section 7207, the misdemeanor under Section 7207 would still not be a lesser included offense within the felony under Section 7206 because knowledge of falsity is a key element of the misdemeanor, but is not an element of the felony.","start":1365.29,"stop":1390.39,"duration":25.1},{"text":"Even if willfulness has no relationship by some strange court to the states of mind that
