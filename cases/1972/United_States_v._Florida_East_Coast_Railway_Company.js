cars.","start":103.16,"stop":119.418,"duration":16.26},{"text":"Freight car shortages have been a serious and recurring problem throughout most of this century.","start":119.418,"stop":124.27,"duration":4.85},{"text":"In recent years, the Commission, with the strong encouragement and support of Congress, has been moving on a number of fronts to combat this problem.","start":124.27,"stop":133.381,"duration":9.11},{"text":"Just last term in the Allegheny-Ludlum case, this Court upheld two car service rules promulgated by the Commission under Section 114 (a).","start":133.381,"stop":144.03,"duration":10.65},{"text":"Those rules governed the return of unloaded freight cars to their owners.","start":144.03,"stop":150.179,"duration":6.15},{"text":"The instant rule making proceeding was initiated by the Commission in 1967 after an earlier proceeding had been dismissed for warrant of sufficient evidence.","start":150.179,"stop":162.832,"duration":12.65},{"text":"In initiating this proceeding, the Commission ordered the railroads to participate in a nationwide study of freight car shortages.","start":162.832,"stop":173.039,"duration":10.21},{"text":"During an 11-month period in 1968, over 32,000 reports were filed from state stations throughout the country-- no, it were

that day.","start":189.121,"stop":213.117,"duration":24},{"text":"Extensive field audits were conducted by Commission personnel to assure that the reports were filed and filled out directly and, also, to assure that they did not reflect over-auditing of cars by shippers.","start":213.117,"stop":231.685,"duration":18.57},{"text":"The collective data were put on magnetic tapes and were available to the railroads.","start":231.685,"stop":238.909,"duration":7.22},{"text":"In December 1969, the Commission issued an interim report containing an analysis of the data collected from the study and proposing a rule establishing a scale of incentive per diem charges for plain boxcars.","start":238.909,"stop":257.521,"duration":18.61},{"text":"In appendices to the report, the Commission described

boxcars.","start":257.521,"stop":275.471,"duration":17.95},{"text":"The study showed that there were deficiencies in placements of freight cars with shippers throughout the year, but that the deficiencies were most severe during the heavy traffic months from September through February each year.","start":275.471,"stop":290.019,"duration":14.55},{"text":"The study also revealed that, at the same time the deficiencies were reported by some freight stations, surpluses of cars would be reported by other stations frequently on the same railroad.","start":290.019,"stop":306.097,"duration":16.08},{"text":"Analyzing these data, the Commission included that, at least during the peak period from September through February each year, the surpluses were not sufficient so that the railroads could be expected to eliminate the deficiencies simply by using their boxcars more efficiently.","start":306.097,"stop":327.969,"duration":21.87},{"text":"The Commission, thus, concluded that the existing supply of plain boxcars was inadequate.","start":327.969,"stop":334.245,"duration":6.28},{"text":"It does propose the incentive per diem rules to be applicable during the six-month heavy loaded-- heavy traffic period of each year.","start":334.245,"stop":349.972,"duration":15.73},{"text":"Now, the proposed incentive rules were designed by the Commission to do two things.","start":349.972,"stop":355.277,"duration":5.31},{"text":"First, they were designed to improve the utilization of existing cars and, second, they were designed to provide funds to those

these considerations, that that is an implied requirement.","start":689.008,"stop":704.538,"duration":15.53}]},{"speakerName":"Samuel Huntington","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, they do and our response to that is that the 1966 amendment simply builds on what was there before and it does require the Commission to take into account certain factors before imposing an incentive element but, in no way, suggested that, in considering those factors, the Commission must do so only on the basis of the record.","start":704.538,"stop":729.516,"duration":24.98},{"text":"The hearing requirement whether

argument which assumes that Section 556 does apply to this proceeding.","start":755.47,"stop":772.323,"duration":16.85},{"text":"In that event, the Commission was justified in doing away and not having-- not holding oral hearings unless appellees have established before the Commission that they would be prejudiced by the absence of an oral hearing.","start":772.323,"stop":788.932,"duration":16.61},{"text":"The critical question here then is what showing is necessary to establish prejudice and did appellees make that showing.","start":788.932,"stop":800.574,"duration":11.64},{"text":"In our view, there are two basic tests that a request for oral hearing must meet to establish prejudice.","start":800.574,"stop":808.656,"duration":8.08},{"text":"And getting back to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, we would maintain that the District Court did not apply these tests.","start":808.656,"stop":815.712,"duration":7.06},{"text":"Therefore, its finding of prejudice was based on an erroneous standard and is not a finding of fact which this Court should defer to.","start":815.712,"stop":826.305,"duration":10.59},{"text":"The first and most obvious test is that the request must show a need to establish facts in an oral hearing that could not be adequately established through written submissions.","start":826.305,"stop":838.217,"duration":11.91},{"text":"Both appellees have failed to meet this initial test.","start":838.217,"stop":842.247,"duration":4.03},{"text":"Florida East Coast’s basic opposition to the rules stems from the fact that it is located on a peninsula and terminates far more plain boxcar traffic than it originates, and because a lot of the traffic terminates in the southern part of Florida as the verified statements submitted shows, the railroad must continue to pay per diem charges until it can get the unloaded boxcars back to the northern part of its line and on to a connecting railroad.","start":842.247,"stop":874.355,"duration":32.11},{"text":"Florida East Coast argues that because it owns sufficient plain boxcars to satisfy the limited needs of its shippers for plain boxcars and because it operates an efficient operation and generally returns empty cars as fast as it can, the incentive per diem rules would neither prompt it to purchase new cars nor result in the faster return of freight cars and, therefore, the rule shouldn’t be applied to them.","start":874.355,"stop":902.872,"duration":28.52},{"text":"While this argument shows that the application of the rules may not be in Florida East Coast’s best interest, they do not show that an oral hearing was necessary to establish these facts.","start":902.872,"stop":916.056,"duration":13.18},{"text":"In fact, these facts I’ve just outlined were set forth in verified statements in some detail submitted by Florida East Coast, and the Commission’s final report shows that it considered the arguments advanced by Florida East Coast, these policy arguments, and it considered the verified statements but concluded that an exemption from the incentive rules for all terminating roads would not be in the public interest.","start":916.056,"stop":944.804,"duration":28.75},{"text":"Now, Seaboard’s basic opposition to the rules is based on its ownership of a large number of specially equipped boxcars to which the rules do not apply.","start":944.804,"stop":953.936,"duration":9.13},{"text":"Although Seaboard did not submit any verified statements, it has made no showing that it could not have established this fact by written submissions and that it has made no showing that an oral hearing was necessary here.","start":953.936,"stop":966.275,"duration":12.34},{"text":"Now, perhaps recognizing that an oral hearing was not necessary to establish the adverse effect of the rules on them, both railroads argue that an oral hearing was necessary to cross-examine Commission personnel on the preparation an analysis of the freight car study.","start":966.275,"stop":992.889,"duration":26.61},{"text":"Here too, however, appellees could have challenged the Commission’s conclusion from the study by written submission and arguments.","start":992.889,"stop":1000.662,"duration":7.77},{"text":"The appendices to the Commission’s interim report set forth in plain terms the methodology of the study.","start":1000.662,"stop":1009.477,"duration":8.81},{"text":"No one has suggested that this methodology was unsound.","start":1009.477,"stop":1015.291,"duration":5.81},{"text":"I’d like to quote from the-- a verified statement submitted by the Penn Central, this is on page 151 of the appendix, where the Penn Central concedes the study data appears to have been gathered by recognized methods of sampling and statistical techniques.","start":1015.291,"stop":1033.207,"duration":17.92},{"text":"Penn Central then goes on to quibble with the conclusions reached by the

inappropriate.","start":1039.202,"stop":1046.878,"duration":7.68},{"text":"With this challenge, the Commission’s conclusions from the tables and graphs that the incentive per diem rule should be adopted to improve the utilization and supply of freight cars.","start":1046.878,"stop":1058.945,"duration":12.07},{"text":"They challenge the analysis that the Commission made from the data and the Commission’s conclusion that there was indeed a national shortage of freight cars and that the rules reasonably adopted to combat that shortage.","start":1058.945,"stop":1076.163,"duration":17.22},{"text":"Well, if appellees believe that the conclusions are unsound, their remedy is not to cross-examine Commission personnel who assisted the Commission in analyzing these data as part of the decision making process.","start":1076.163,"stop":1092.057,"duration":15.89},{"text":"Their remedy is to analyze the data on their own,
