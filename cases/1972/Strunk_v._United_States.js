case.","start":720.214,"stop":740.069,"duration":19.85},{"text":"The difficulty with that argument is that it, it ignores that at time of the finding Mr. Strunk was presumed innocent and if on trial he refuted the result would have been an admitted denial of the right with no remedy.","start":740.069,"stop":756.202,"duration":16.13},{"text":"And this is serious we submit because it judicially repeals the word “speedy” from the Sixth Amendment and merely leaves an accused with the right to be tried.","start":756.202,"stop":770.047,"duration":13.85},{"text":"Now, we are also arguing in this case here that the remedy applied below if permitted to stand will encourage Government prosecutors to give low priority to cases of the sort involved here.","start":770.047,"stop":779.982,"duration":9.93},{"text":"That is where you have an accused who is a prisoner in another jurisdiction on a related charge.","start":779.982,"stop":787.568,"duration":7.59},{"text":"Now if a prosecutor can reasonably anticipate that the only prejudice to be suffered by an accused is this Smith versus Hooey type of undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial he is really under no duty to exercise diligence in bringing the accused to trial.","start":787.568,"stop":803.97,"duration":16.4},{"text":"For the District Court presumably can compensate for a violation of the right in the event of conviction.","start":803.97,"stop":810.658,"duration":6.69},{"text":"Now since an accused such as Strunk can be
