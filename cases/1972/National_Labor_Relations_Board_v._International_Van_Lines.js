enforcement of provisions of the National Labor Relations Board order requiring -- excuse me, requiring the reinstatement of four employees who were engaged in a strike when they were discharged by their employer.","start":134.07,"stop":151.125,"duration":17.06},{"text":"The question presented here concerns the protection which the National Labor Relations Act affords to employees engaged in a strike against their employer for an economic objective, who are discharged for that activity before they have been permanently replaced by that employer.","start":151.125,"stop":168.235,"duration":17.11},{"text":"Thus do, such strikers have an unconditional right to reinstatement to their former jobs as the Board found or is that right to reinstatement lost if the employer can show substantial and legitimate business justifications for refusing to reinstate them as the court below found.","start":168.235,"stop":186.203,"duration":17.97},{"text":"The facts may be briefly summarized as follows.","start":186.203,"stop":189.791,"duration":3.59},{"text":"In August 1967, the Teamsters Union commenced an organizing campaign amongst the employees of 10 to 11 moving and storage companies within the Santa Maria, California area including the respondent, International Van Lines.","start":189.791,"stop":203.359,"duration":13.57},{"text":"On September 21st, the Union that had obtained authorization cards from five of six of International's employees filed a representation petition with the National Labor Relations Board, a copy of which was unserved upon the company and received by it on September 25.","start":203.359,"stop":220.789,"duration":17.43},{"text":"A week later on October 2nd and 3rd, this Union held meetings at which the Union representatives told the employees that certain companies being organized, including International had withdrawn their consent for an NLRB election.","start":220.789,"stop":237.603,"duration":16.81},{"text":"There was also some discussion at that time about the discharge of employees of other companies other than -- than International.","start":237.603,"stop":244.684,"duration":7.08},{"text":"In any event, the assembled employees decided to strike and did so on October 4th.","start":244.684,"stop":250.711,"duration":6.03},{"text":"Three of International's employees, Dicus, Manuel Vasquez, and Mr. Casillas refused to cross the picket line and the fourth, Robert Vasquez did not report for work that day because of the picket line.","start":250.711,"stop":264.705,"duration":13.99},{"text":"The president of International, Robert McEwan obtained temporary replacements the next day, October 5th, from his brother who had a similar moving and storage company within the area and sent telegrams to Manuel and Robert Vasquez and Dicus advising them that they had been permanently replaced.","start":264.705,"stop":282.595,"duration":17.89},{"text":"Seven days later, on October 12, the Union filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Manuel and Robert Vasquez, Casillas, and Dicus had all been discriminatorily discharged in violation of the National Labor Relations Act.","start":282.595,"stop":299.807,"duration":17.21},{"text":"Between October 8th and October 28th, Dicus and Manuel Vasquez each asked the president of the company, Mr. McEwan, who was then hospitalized whether each was going to have a job and neither received any commitment.","start":299.807,"stop":314.032,"duration":14.22},{"text":"Dicus had the same experience shortly after Mr. McEwan left the hospital on October 28th.","start":314.032,"stop":321.191,"duration":7.16},{"text":"In the latter part of November, Casillas who had prior to that time, a casual worker, asked Mr. McEwan to put him back on the availability list for call.","start":321.191,"stop":331.653,"duration":10.46},{"text":"He received no particular commitment and he has not or had not at the time of the hearing been recalled to work.","start":331.653,"stop":338.753,"duration":7.1},{"text":"On October 12th, Manuel and Robert Vasquez and Dicus asked Mr. McEwan to be reinstated and were refused.","start":338.753,"stop":345.964,"duration":7.21},{"text":"The strike continued on at least through the hearing which commenced on April 3, 1968.","start":345.964,"stop":352.782,"duration":6.82},{"text":"The Board found that the company's employees were engaged in a protected strike to compel a consent election and that even if the objected strike was to compel immediate recognition by the company, of the Union, it was a protected strike.","start":352.782,"stop":367.564,"duration":14.78},{"text":"Further the Board found that Manuel and Robert Vasquez and Dicus were discharged by the telegram sent on October 5th for as a matter of fact, they had not been permanently replaced at that time.","start":367.564,"stop":379.924,"duration":12.36},{"text":"And further, that all four employees which includes -- included Casillas, the casual employee, were refused reinstatement upon their unconditional offers or applications for reinstatement which further violated Sections 8 (a) (3) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act.","start":379.924,"stop":397.109,"duration":17.19},{"text":"The Board ordered reinstatement of all four of these employees even if that reinstatement required the discharge of strike replacements which may or may not had been hired since the time -- since the time of the discharge and the refusal of reinstatement of these employees.","start":397.109,"stop":417.057,"duration":19.95},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit found that all four of the employees have been discharged on October 5 for engaging in a protected strike which sought a consent election, but none had been permanently replaced up until that time and that as such, those discharges violated Sections 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act.","start":417.057,"stop":436.456,"duration":19.4},{"text":"The Court further found that the three of the strikers excluding Casillas at this point, the casual, made unconditional request for reinstatement which were denied.","start":436.456,"stop":447.352,"duration":10.9},{"text":"And that Casillas had made a similar request, but because he was a casual employee, was not clear to the Ninth Circuit, whether in fact he had been denied reinstatement or whether there just had not yet been an opportunity for the employer to call him back to work.","start":447.352,"stop":461.601,"duration":14.25},{"text":"The Court remanded that latter -- that latter execution to the Board.","start":461.601,"stop":465.889,"duration":4.29},{"text":"However, despite these findings and despite an assumption by the Ninth Circuit, the employees who struck after the discharge of these employees, who continued their strike, might in fact be properly considered to be unfair labor practice strikers.","start":465.889,"stop":479.762,"duration":13.87},{"text":"The Court held that the discharge strikers remained economic strikers, finding that to be their status at the time they were in fact discharged.","start":479.762,"stop":488.128,"duration":8.37},{"text":"Accordingly, although these employees had not been replaced when fired, the Court found that they were not entitled to reinstatement if the employer had a legitimate and substantial business justification for refusing to reinstate them which includes the hiring of permanent replacement since the -- since their discharge.","start":488.128,"stop":506.85,"duration":18.72},{"text":"The Court remanded the case to the Board to make this determination.","start":506.85,"stop":512.82,"duration":5.97},{"text":"In argument, I think it might be helpful to discuss initially some of the general principles involved in this area which are not, in my judgment, disputed.","start":512.82,"stop":523.649,"duration":10.83},{"text":"Thus, there is no dispute between the parties concerning the validity of the consistently recognized distinction between the reinstatement rights of unfair labor practice strikers and economic strikers.","start":523.649,"stop":535.446,"duration":11.8},{"text":"Unfair labor practice strikers are those who strike activity, either begins and or is prolonged or aggravated of -- by reaction against employer of unfair labor practices and economic strikers are generally everybody else.","start":535.446,"stop":549.869,"duration":14.42},{"text":"Economic strikers are entitled to reinstatement at the end of their strike unless the employer can show some substantial and a legitimate business justification for failing to reinstate them such as the continuing presence of permanent replacers -- replacements in their jobs.","start":549.869,"stop":565.357,"duration":15.49},{"text":"The theory here is that although the employer may not discriminate against those strikers, it does have a legitimate interest in operating his business during the strike and may in the balancing of the interest and equities involved obtain permanent replacements for those strikers.","start":565.357,"stop":581.829,"duration":16.47},{"text":"Unfair labor practice strikers on the other hand are entitled to unconditional reinstatement regardless of the employer's business justification for not reinstating them including the presence of permanent replacements.","start":581.829,"stop":596.953,"duration":15.12},{"text":"The theory here is that such strikers are acting to protect themselves against the illegal acts of the employer which violate the Act.","start":596.953,"stop":604.954,"duration":8},{"text":"And although the employer can and has a legitimate interest in operating his business during the strike, he may not penalize his employees by permanently replacing them for the action which they've taken really in response to his transgression.","start":604.954,"stop":618.998,"duration":14.04},{"text":"Further elaborating on the foregoing, it's also clear that a strike that starts as an economic strike may in fact become an unfair labor practice strike, thus conferring the economic strikers and the unfair labor practice strikers where the employer's commission of an unfair labor practice has the effect of prolonging or aggravating a strike.","start":618.998,"stop":637.487,"duration":18.49},{"text":"And finally and apart from the discussion of unfair labor practice and economic strike of that distinction, I think it is also clear that the discharge of economic strikers for strike absences before they have been permanently replaced is discrimination and violates Sections 8 (a) (3) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act.","start":637.487,"stop":656.916,"duration":19.43},{"text":"As I say, up to this point, I think there is no disagreement between the respondent, the petitioner nor indeed by the court below.","start":656.916,"stop":663.891,"duration":6.97}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Is that true even though or is that what this case is about even though a person who is fired

replacement to the extent of the dicta, what I would call the dicta in that case is different from Fleetwood, yes.","start":783.926,"stop":799.496,"duration":15.57},{"text":"I think it's implicitly an extension of rights.","start":799.496,"stop":805.677,"duration":6.18},{"text":"The court below, however, did find in this case that all -- all four of the strikers were discharged before they had been permanent -- permanently replaced, they could not, as a matter of law require any greater reinstatement rights than those of economic strikers, for that was a status that they had held at the time of their discharge.","start":805.677,"stop":824.022,"duration":18.35},{"text":"And this is true in the Ninth Circuit's view even if those discharges converted the strike in question and the strikers, the non-discharge strikers in the unfair -- into an unfair labor practice strike and then into an unfair labor practice group of strikers.","start":824.022,"stop":839.883,"duration":15.86},{"text":"I think that the Court's position is erroneous for at least two reasons.","start":839.883,"stop":844.228,"duration":4.34},{"text":"First, wholly apart from whether the four dischargees became unfair labor practice strikers are not, the respondent, because of its action and unlawfully discharging them has an unconditional obligation to reinstate them.","start":844.228,"stop":859.203,"duration":14.98},{"text":"A classic remedy for an unlawful discharge of an employee is unconditional reinstatement for that's the best way to restore the status quo ante.","start":859.203,"stop":867.433,"duration":8.23},{"text":"This holds true whether the dischargee was unlawfully discharged from active duty or whether he's unlawfully discharged from a picket line before he had been replaced.","start":867.433,"stop":877.139,"duration":9.71},{"text":"In the latter case, the striker not having been replaced at that time -- at the time of his wrongful discharge had an unconditional right to return to work.","start":877.139,"stop":886.158,"duration":9.02},{"text":"He was terminated from that position and in order to replace and put things back into status quo, that wrongfully terminated striker should be in the same position that he was in before he was discharged which is the position of an economic striker with an unconditional ability to return.","start":886.158,"stop":903.414,"duration":17.26},{"text":"Thus, the circuits have uniformly held that without regard to whether the strikes subsequently takes on the nature of a protest against an employer's unfair labor practice, that that employer may not lawfully terminate economic strikers prior to the time they've been validly replaced and that the appropriate remedy therefore is reinstatement even if that requires the displacement of post-firing replacements.","start":903.414,"stop":926.192,"duration":22.78},{"text":"Just as an employer may not deny reinstatement to an employee unlawfully discharged while he is actively working on the grounds that he subsequently replaced that discharged employee, so too a striking employee can have no less protection.","start":926.192,"stop":941.213,"duration":15.02},{"text":"To hold otherwise, I think would be to recognize a distinction between non-strike concerted activities protected by Section 7 on the National Labor Relations Act, and strike activities similarly protected.","start":941.213,"stop":954.354,"duration":13.14},{"text":"Congress did not authorize such a distinction to be made and rightly so or no one can deny that the right to legally strike is one of the paramount protected activities under the National Labor Relations Act and indeed Congress so recognized specifically in passing Section 13 of that Act.","start":954.354,"stop":970.623,"duration":16.27},{"text":"Secondly, and contrary to the court below, the Board could properly find that by continuing to strike after their unlawful discharge, the four dischargees in this case became unfair labor practice strikers.","start":970.623,"stop":983.62,"duration":13},{"text":"It is I submit a reasonable inference for the Board to make that the dischargees had added to their protest against their employer, their unlawful discharge.","start":983.62,"stop":997.203,"duration":13.58},{"text":"And further that the unfair labor practice of firing a striker has such an effect upon a strike is to tend to prolong it.","start":997.203,"stop":1005.287,"duration":8.08},{"text":"At the very least, the Board in the exercise of its expertise may, I submit, properly conclude that the discriminatory and unlawful discharge of strikers is so likely to have an impact upon the strike itself that such an act by the employer shifts the burden to that employer to show that the strike was not in fact impacted by the illegal discharges.","start":1005.287,"stop":1028.815,"duration":23.53}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A.
