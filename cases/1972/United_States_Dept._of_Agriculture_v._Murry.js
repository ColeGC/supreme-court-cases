discussion of the constitutional issues in this case.","start":502.125,"stop":508.384,"duration":6.26},{"text":"The appellees’ principal challenge to the statute is on grounds of equal protection.","start":508.384,"stop":514.19,"duration":5.81},{"text":"In the standard of reviewing equal protection cases or cases involving equal protection challenges to welfare classifications is by now well established.","start":514.19,"stop":524.511,"duration":10.32},{"text":"A welfare classification such as the one involved here, must be upheld if it furthers any reasonable purpose which maybe attributed to the legislature.","start":524.511,"stop":533.987,"duration":9.48},{"text":"As this Court reiterated last month in Ortwein against Schwab and in the last term in Richardson against Belcher and Jefferson against Hackney, a legislative allocation of welfare benefits maybe sustained, must be sustained if it is shown that the allocation has a reasonable basis and we believe that this tax dependent amendment does have such a reasonable basis.","start":533.987,"stop":558.095,"duration":24.11},{"text":"As a matter it was added to the Food Stamp Act, only after Congress had acquired several years experience with the administration of food stamp program.","start":558.095,"stop":567.616,"duration":9.52},{"text":"And during those years it had become apparent that although the program generally upgraded in a satisfactory manner, it was subject to some abuses.","start":567.616,"stop":577.474,"duration":9.86},{"text":"By 1970, many Congressmen fear that unless these abuses could somehow be eliminated, the whole program might be terminated as a result of rising political opposition.","start":577.474,"stop":588.956,"duration":11.48},{"text":"One of the most significant abuses at least in the minds of many Congressmen was the obtaining and use of food stamps by the college-age children of higher income families and the tax dependent amendment represents the Congressional response to this general problem.","start":588.956,"stop":606.716,"duration":17.76},{"text":"The underlying premises of this amendment are that the food stamp program was not intended to provide welfare assistance to college students and other young adults who are being supported by parents who are financially better off.","start":606.716,"stop":619.783,"duration":13.07},{"text":"And also, that when these parents receive a tax benefit for supporting their children, they have assumed the primary responsibility for making certain that that support is adequate.","start":619.783,"stop":630.797,"duration":11.01},{"text":"In short, through the tax deduction the Government has already in essence paid for the support of these young people.","start":630.797,"stop":637.788,"duration":6.99},{"text":"It needn’t provide food stamps as well.","start":637.788,"stop":640.668,"duration":2.88},{"text":"So the effect of the amendment is to restrict the coverage of the food stamp program to low income households which have no apparent access to substantial parental support and with respect to which no higher income family is obtaining a tax benefit and we submit that Congress had the right to choose to go this far and no further in the provision of food stamp assistance.","start":640.668,"stop":665.693,"duration":25.02},{"text":"Appellees’ equal protection argument apparently is based on the general claim that even if this statute was generally effective in eliminating the abuses with which Congress was concerned, it’s nevertheless unconstitutional insofar as it denies food stamps to certain needy households.","start":665.693,"stop":685.671,"duration":19.98},{"text":"We concede that some needy households maybe denied of food stamps, but we don’t invest that fact of constitutional significance.","start":685.671,"stop":694.686,"duration":9.01},{"text":"First, I think it’s appropriate to point out that the appellees seem to have exaggerated the effect of this amendment.","start":694.686,"stop":701.521,"duration":6.83},{"text":"They propound a variety of hypothetical cases, but they fail to show that the amendment will in fact bar assistance to significant numbers of needy households.","start":701.521,"stop":710.95,"duration":9.43},{"text":"To the contrary, Congress could recently assume the very few truly poor households containing young adult who in fact is receiving more than half of his support from a parent who is not himself poor, Congress could determine that parents who receive the tax benefits with dependency exemption, have assumed and are fulfilling their responsibility to support their children.","start":710.95,"stop":733.402,"duration":22.45},{"text":"Secondly, a welfare classification such as this one is not unconstitutional simply because it doesn’t reach all persons who had benefit from welfare assistance.","start":733.402,"stop":743.711,"duration":10.31},{"text":"As this Court has often noted, a welfare classification need not be made with mathematical precision.","start":743.711,"stop":750.703,"duration":6.99},{"text":"Thus in this case, if the food stamp program fails to reach all needy households which have no access to parental support, it’s not for that reason alone unconstitutional.","start":750.703,"stop":763.206,"duration":12.5},{"text":"Finally, Congress can limit the coverage of a welfare program by the use of non-need eligibility criteria.","start":763.206,"stop":770.663,"duration":7.46},{"text":"It needn't restrict itself to the use of need as the sole eligibility criteria.","start":770.663,"stop":776.664,"duration":6},{"text":"Given that many necessary physical restraints on welfare expenditures, Congress could reasonably determine that if children of higher income parents, when the parents themselves are enjoying tax benefits from supporting their children or needy that’s primarily the responsibility of the parents and perhaps also the children if they're voluntarily unemployed.","start":776.664,"stop":800.162,"duration":23.5},{"text":"But it’s not necessarily, it’s not constitutionally the responsibility of the Government.","start":800.162,"stop":805.134,"duration":4.97},{"text":"Congress has paid for the support of these children in a sense through the tax deductions, doesn’t have to provide food stamps as well.","start":805.134,"stop":813.007,"duration":7.87},{"text":"Appellees’ claim in essence is that the Government should be required to pay twice for their support.","start":813.007,"stop":819.854,"duration":6.85},{"text":"Once through the tax deduction and then a second time through the food stamps.","start":819.854,"stop":824.954,"duration":5.1},{"text":"We see no reasons, tax exemption --","start":824.954,"stop":828.125,"duration":3.17}]},{"speakerName":"Potter
