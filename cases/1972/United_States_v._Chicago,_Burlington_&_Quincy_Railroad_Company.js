certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.","start":34.528,"stop":41.028,"duration":6.5},{"text":"The sole issue presented in the Government’s petition for certiorari is whether the respondent railroad is entitled to take depreciation deductions with respect to certain to properties paid for by governmental agencies for the purpose of improving safety and traffic flow at highway -- railroad intersections.","start":41.028,"stop":60.829,"duration":19.8},{"text":"The issue is governed as I shall explain by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 which are no longer applicable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.","start":60.829,"stop":72.207,"duration":11.38},{"text":"The resolution of this question of construction of the 1939 Code, however, will continue to effect tax returns filed for many future years, especially with respect to the railroading utility industries because the relevant amendments to the 1954 Code do not apply to properties paid for as for those in issue here prior to 1954 and most of these properties have very long useful lives, in some cases, as many as 50 or 60 years.","start":72.207,"stop":103.31,"duration":31.1},{"text":"The background of the properties with respect to which respondent seeks depreciation deductions here is as follows.","start":103.31,"stop":111.7,"duration":8.39},{"text":"Beginning in the early 1930s, respondent and many other railroads entered into agreements with various State Governments for construction of facilities to improve the safety and traffic flow conditions at highway-railroad intersections.","start":111.7,"stop":128.276,"duration":16.58},{"text":"The initial agreements between the railroads and the States provided that the states would substantially, though not entirely, reimburse the railroads for those facilities which it was the railroad’s obligation to construct.","start":128.276,"stop":142.405,"duration":14.13},{"text":"Shortly after these initial agreements were reached, Congress passed a series of statutes which authorized the Federal Government to pay at least part of the state share of the construction cost of these facilities.","start":142.405,"stop":157.297,"duration":14.89},{"text":"This is set forth in the National Industry Recovery Act at 48 Stat. 195, Section 203 and is a 1933 statute.","start":157.297,"stop":167.173,"duration":9.88},{"text":"In the years following the initial agreements and the initial authorization of partial federal reimbursement of state expenses, the railroads who presumably felt that these facilities designed to improve highway traffic conditions were tangential to the profitable operation of their railroad business displayed great reluctance to share substantially in the construction costs and disputes between the railroads and the states were quite frequent over allocation of the costs.","start":167.173,"stop":201.587,"duration":34.41},{"text":"In order to settle these disputes, the Congress passed the Federal Highway Act of 1944 which was basically a stepped version of the prior act and this act authorized the Federal Government to reimburse the States for the entire cost of the facilities such as those at issue here, subject only to the limitation that to the extent that the railroad was deemed to receive direct benefit from these facilities, it should reimburse the Federal Government on a pro rata basis up to a maximum of 10% of the cost of any particular facility.","start":201.587,"stop":236.659,"duration":35.07},{"text":"The result was that the States initially absorbed all or most of the cost of the facilities for which they were reimbursed by the Federal Government and the railroads paid only so much as was deemed to reflect the benefit which the railroad derived from the facilities and this Court in no event exceed 10% of the cost.","start":236.659,"stop":257.685,"duration":21.03},{"text":"Now, although there is some question as to whether respondents or the States have title to the facilities under the terms of these agreements.","start":257.685,"stop":264.721,"duration":7.04},{"text":"The agreements do provide that respondent is obligated to maintain the facilities “directly related to railroad use,” such as rail bridges and roadbeds and tracks and the states are correspondingly required maintain the facilities directly related to motor vehicle use such as highway bridges and approaches.","start":264.721,"stop":287.457,"duration":22.74},{"text":"The majority of the Court of Claims here appears to have assumed that the obligation to maintain these facilities includes the obligation to replace worn out equipment.","start":287.457,"stop":298.43,"duration":10.97},{"text":"Judge Davis found that questionable proposition, but he Court of Claims appears to have found the respondent had the obligation here to maintain and replace those, at least those facilities, most directly related to railroad use.","start":298.43,"stop":313.474,"duration":15.04},{"text":"And at this point, I should point out that the Government and respondent appear to be in some disagreement as to precisely the type of facilities which respondent seeks here to depreciate.","start":313.474,"stop":326.23,"duration":12.76},{"text":"The Court of Claims did not make a specific finding as to what percentage of the facilities at issue here were of the type closely related to the railroad business and correspondingly what percentage were closely related to highway use and this would bear for example, upon the question whether respondent was obligated to maintain and replace the facilities that it seeks to depreciate, a question which to be sure, we do not believe to be dispositive of this case.","start":326.23,"stop":353.938,"duration":27.71},{"text":"The Court did find and this finding is at page 55a of our certiorari petition that about a million and a half or a somewhat more than $2 million of property at issue here, was in the category of “Highway under crossings or highway over crossings.”","start":353.938,"stop":374.127,"duration":20.19},{"text":"We assumed perhaps in some haste, that highway under crossings and highway over crossings referred to highway facilities over railroad tracks and concluded on that basis that at least 71% of the amount in controversy represented facilities in the category most directly related to highway use.","start":374.127,"stop":394.739,"duration":20.61},{"text":"Judge Davis appears to have assumed the same thing and I refer you in that connection to footnote 2 on page 48a of the petition.","start":394.739,"stop":404.196,"duration":9.46},{"text":"Respondent now asserts in his brief that it is not claiming any highway structures here and that the items in its account 6 which the Court of Claims described as highway under crossings are in fact railroad bridges of some sort.","start":404.196,"stop":418.015,"duration":13.82},{"text":"In this connection, it cites the joint exhibit found at page 51 of the appendix in which the items in account 6 are described simply as bridges.","start":418.015,"stop":426.486,"duration":8.47},{"text":"Respondent claims that the bridges in this account are all rail bridges and that in spite of the finding of the Court of Claims, it has not sought to depreciate any highway under crossings or over crossings.","start":426.486,"stop":436.912,"duration":10.43},{"text":"Now, our examination of the record in this case including an inspection of the tax returns filed by respondent does not provide a satisfactory answer to the question whether the items in account 6 include highway crossings and if so, to what extent and the litigation as I think quite rightfully not focused closely on this point.","start":436.912,"stop":455.04,"duration":18.13},{"text":"We felt it is desirable to bring this discrepancy between our reading of the record and respondent’s assertion to the Court’s attention, but for reasons which I shall refer to several times in the course of this argument, hopefully, our position is in no way dependent upon the answer to the question whether the bulk of the facilities in question were directly related to highway use or railway use.","start":455.04,"stop":478.378,"duration":23.34}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"As a matter of terminology both highway under crossing and highway over crossing could refer to the railroad structures.","start":478.378,"stop":485.535,"duration":7.16},{"text":"They would not necessarily include highway --","start":485.535,"stop":486.984,"duration":1.45}]},{"speakerName":"Richard B.

industry.","start":637.157,"stop":646.077,"duration":8.92},{"text":"They are basically involved, the post second World War changes from retirement to depreciation accounting and I am told that that was such a widespread practice due to the fact there was such low retirements and high profits during the second World War and most railroads and most industries generally, did their accounting on the basis of -- did their accounting on the basis of retirement, but it became much more profitable after the war to do it on the basis of straight depreciation technique.","start":646.077,"stop":682.097,"duration":36.02},{"text":"But I don’t know specifically, if there are any cases backed up right now which do not involve the terms letter.","start":682.097,"stop":690.363,"duration":8.27},{"text":"In deciding this issue in respondent's favor the Court of Claims held both that the depreciation deductions were allowable on the applicable provisions of the 1939 Code and then in addition, respondent had not given up its right to take depreciation deductions on donated properties when it entered into these terms letter agreements.","start":690.363,"stop":710.079,"duration":19.72},{"text":"It is our position that even if the 1939 Code allowed the respondent a depreciation deduction in these circumstances which we certainly believe it did not, respondent was precluded from taking these deductions as a result of the binding terms letter agreement it entered into.","start":710.079,"stop":727.081,"duration":17},{"text":"This is a question of contract interpretation essentially.","start":727.081,"stop":729.774,"duration":2.69},{"text":"It is quite thoroughly covered in our brief and I shall focus my attention in this argument on the primary question with respect to which we sought certiorari here which is whether the respondent is entitled under the terms of the 1939 Code, to take deductions in these circumstances for the depreciation of properties in which it has incurred no cost.","start":729.774,"stop":754.14,"duration":24.37},{"text":"The fundamental concept of the depreciation deduction and this is virtually an (Inaudible) since its inception has been that tax payers deduct from taxable income that portion of their assets which is used up in earning that income.","start":754.14,"stop":769.669,"duration":15.53},{"text":"The deduction for depreciation is essentially an expense deduction.","start":769.669,"stop":772.903,"duration":3.23},{"text":"It’s designed to reflect approximately that portion of a taxpayer’s expense incurred in the purchase of its assets which is attributable to the production of income in any particular year.","start":772.903,"stop":785.489,"duration":12.59},{"text":"Accordingly, both the 1939 and 1954 Internal Revenue Codes provide that the basis on which depreciation is allowed is the same as the basis for determining gain or loss in disposition of the property and in most instances, this is the expense that the taxpayer has incurred in purchasing the asset which is of course the taxpayer’s cost.","start":785.489,"stop":808.378,"duration":22.89},{"text":"If an asset has caused the taxpayer nothing, its gradual consumption represents no expense to him and there is ordinarily no reason to give him an expense deduction.","start":808.378,"stop":818.439,"duration":10.06},{"text":"Now, there ought to be sure certain refinements of the general rule that the depreciation basis is the taxpayers cost.","start":818.439,"stop":826.224,"duration":7.79},{"text":"In certain situations for example, the tax laws have historically provided that a taxpayer to whom assets are transferred in certain well defined types of transactions, takes over the basis of the transferor rather than acquiring a new basis.","start":826.224,"stop":842.648,"duration":16.42},{"text":"This is known commonly as a carryover basis.","start":842.648,"stop":845.664,"duration":3.02},{"text":"This is true for example where a taxpayer receives property in a transfer which the code characterizes as a gift.","start":845.664,"stop":853.17,"duration":7.51},{"text":"There is also a carryover of the transferor's basis in many situations in which property is transferred to a corporation by its shareholders for example.","start":853.17,"stop":863.228,"duration":10.06},{"text":"Section 358 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides a classic example of carryover basis which is a carryover basis for property transfer to a corporation in a Section 351 transfer which is transfer in exchange for stock or securities in a corporation controlled by the transferors.","start":863.228,"stop":884.024,"duration":20.8},{"text":"The reasons for providing a carryover basis in these situations are various and they are quite complex and would not fruitfully be explored in the context of this argument.","start":884.024,"stop":895.956,"duration":11.93},{"text":"But I would suggest that close analysis justifies the conclusion that these provisions do not really represent departures from the notion that basis is fundamentally a function of cost.","start":895.956,"stop":908.117,"duration":12.16},{"text":"Rather these special provisions reflect the legislative view that in certain circumstances, well defined and for certain reasons, the purposes of the Code are most consistently and effectively carried out when the basis of an asset is unchanged in the hands of a transferee or if you will, when the cost basis of someone else other than the transferee taxpayer is the most appropriate basis.","start":908.117,"stop":935.637,"duration":27.52},{"text":"Now, what is the situation that we deal with here?","start":935.637,"stop":939.491,"duration":3.85},{"text":"Section 113 (a) (8) (B) of the 1939 Code, provided that corporate taxpayers could take over that transferor’s basis, a carryover basis, in this case to be sure that assets we’re dealing with are new and so that the question is not one of whether it is a carryover basis or a taxpayer’s cost basis because those are one of the same, the question is simply whether the taxpayer takes over any basis at all on these assets.","start":939.491,"stop":969.643,"duration":30.15},{"text":"Section 113 (a) (8) (B), provided that corporate taxpayers could take the transferor’s basis including for purposes of depreciation in property transferred as “A \"contribution to capital\"” and that is the term we are dealing with here.","start":969.643,"stop":986.213,"duration":16.57},{"text":"Ordinarily, that term “\"contribution to capital\"” refers to a transfer of money or other property to a corporation by a shareholder.","start":986.213,"stop":995.305,"duration":9.09},{"text":"In this situation, the \"contribution to capital\" is quite logically considered a part of the shareholder’s investment in his equity interest in the corporation and it’s treated much the same way as consideration paid for example for the issuance of stock.","start":995.305,"stop":1011.19,"duration":15.89},{"text":"But the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 did not restrict the right to acquire a basis and correspondingly to depreciate assets donated as contributions to capital -- to assets donated by shareholders.","start":1011.19,"stop":1027.148,"duration":15.96},{"text":"It simply provided that the corporation acquired the transferor’s basis and a \"contribution to capital.\"","start":1027.148,"stop":1033.359,"duration":6.21},{"text":"Consequently, it appears that the 1939 Code contemplated that non-shareholders could also make contributions to a corporation’s capital and that the corporation could take over the transferor’s basis in these assets for depreciation purposes.","start":1033.359,"stop":1051.31,"duration":17.95},{"text":"Significantly by virtue of this Court’s holding in Edwards against Cuba Railroad 268 U.S., a property transferred in these circumstances was held not to constitute income to the transferee corporation.","start":1051.31,"stop":1065.269,"duration":13.96},{"text":"Nonetheless, under the 1939 Code, corporate taxpayers who received the donated assets which could be categorized as contributions to capital, were able to take depreciation deductions with respect to these assets in which they had no investment and which they had received entirely for income tax liability.","start":1065.269,"stop":1086.24,"duration":20.97},{"text":"Congress changed the situation when it enacted the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.","start":1086.24,"stop":1091.966,"duration":5.73},{"text":"Section 362 (c) of the current Code provides that contributions to capital made by non-shareholders after June 1954 have a basis of zero for depreciation and other purposes in the hands of the transferee, so that the basis is no longer carried over from the transferor.","start":1091.966,"stop":1110.714,"duration":18.75},{"text":"But for cases such as this one which involved assets transferred before the application -- the applicable date of Section 362, it is still necessary to inquire whether the transfer in question can be classified as a \"contribution to capital\" within the meeting of Section 113 (a) (8) of the 1939 Code.","start":1110.714,"stop":1133.118,"duration":22.4},{"text":"Let me make it clear that we are not in any way whatsoever implying that respondent should be deprived of a benefit which the 1939 Code provides to it.","start":1133.118,"stop":1143.147,"duration":10.03},{"text":"We are not attempting to make the amendments contained in Section 362 of the 1954 Code retroactive because they are explicitly made prospective in application only.","start":1143.147,"stop":1153.394,"duration":10.25},{"text":"The specific issue in this case, however, is the definition of the term \"contribution to capital\" as used in Section 113 (a) (8) (B) of the 1939 Code and that term is not defined in the Code.","start":1153.394,"stop":1166.613,"duration":13.22},{"text":"As I’ve indicated, it is a term ordinarily associated with transfers by shareholders or persons with underlying equity interests in a corporation.","start":1166.613,"stop":1176.14,"duration":9.53},{"text":"The question in this case is, what does the term \"contribution to capital\" mean in the context of a transfer to a corporation by a non-shareholder?","start":1176.14,"stop":1186.959,"duration":10.82},{"text":"With respect to this question, we believe that it is highly relevant to understand that the allowance of a depreciation basis in this circumstances was a departure from the traditional notion of depreciation as a reflection of expense actually incurred as an asset is used up and we believe it is reasonable to conclude from the context that the term \"contribution to capital\" was not intended to apply to all transfers made to a corporation without immediately apparent consideration, but that the term was intended to have a rather specific meaning and it is that meaning which we are attempting to uncover here.","start":1186.959,"stop":1228.729,"duration":41.77},{"text":"Indeed, we submit that the decisions of this Court rendered while Section 113 (a) (8) (B) was still in effect have interpreted the term \"contribution to capital\" in the context of non-shareholder transfers in a very specific and limited way.","start":1228.729,"stop":1245.615,"duration":16.89},{"text":"Essentially, we deal with two cases in which this Court specifically considered whether transfers of assets to a corporation by a non-shareholder constituted contributions to capital.","start":1245.615,"stop":1257.696,"duration":12.08},{"text":"In both of these two cases, the Court tested the assets in question in terms of the donative intent of the transferor.","start":1257.696,"stop":1264.365,"duration":6.67},{"text":"Specifically in terms of whether the transferor’s intention was to increase the corporation’s capital, whether he was making a contribution to the corporation’s capital.","start":1264.365,"stop":1275.648,"duration":11.28},{"text":"Thus, in the Detroit Edison case, decided in 1943 at 319 U.S., the taxpayer was a utility

depreciation accounting from -- retirement accounting to straight-line depreciation accounting revised or schedules were submitted to the Internal Revenue Service and an offer of a terms letter agreement, a consent of this change over in accounting was sent to the taxpayer.","start":3035.326,"stop":3065.805,"duration":30.48},{"text":"Included in that terms letter in 1945 was the document

precluded from the benefits of such changes.","start":3093.878,"stop":3118.43,"duration":24.55},{"text":"Now, considering the status of the law in regard to these depreciation deductions in 1945, it’s clear why these were not included in the schedule submitted by respondent to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.","start":3118.43,"stop":3135.035,"duration":16.61},{"text":"In 1943, this Court decided the Detroit Edison case and subsequent to that decision, the commissioner began to disallow depreciation deductions to the Brown Shoe Company based on the Detroit Edison case.","start":3135.035,"stop":3151.61,"duration":16.58},{"text":"That’s what initiated the lawsuit by the Brown Shoe Company to be allowed to claim these depreciation deductions and that issue was resolved by this Court in 1950.","start":3151.61,"stop":3165.087,"duration":13.48},{"text":"So, from the period from 1943 to 1950, it was the position of the commissioner and the government that nobody was entitled to any depreciation deductions on contributions to capital similar to those at issue in Brown Shoe and here.","start":3165.087,"stop":3180.745,"duration":15.66},{"text":"Therefore, it would have been a meaningless act for us to, as a result of a request for change over in accounting raise the issue when that was the current understanding of the Commissioner and the Government.","start":3180.745,"stop":3192.052,"duration":11.31},{"text":"The terms letter itself and the memo 58 both specifically were qualified to indicate that depreciation was to be in accordance

this Court’s decision on the Brown Shoe case that contributions of this nature were properly depreciable.","start":3209.9,"stop":3220.052,"duration":10.15},{"text":"It affected a change in the terms and conditions of the terms letter agreement between respondent and commissioner and justified our claim for depreciation deductions even if the memo 58 guidelines could be considered as even partially incorporated into the terms letter offer from the commissioner to respondent.","start":3220.052,"stop":3245.03,"duration":24.98},{"text":"Finally, in conclusion, respondent would like to assert that it's a very simple factual situation we are dealing with here in this case.","start":3245.03,"stop":3256.006,"duration":10.98},{"text":"What we’re talking about are railroad bridges, rail safety facilities that are directly related to the operation of plaintiff’s railroad that we have the legal and practical obligation of replacement of these facilities if as we do continue to desire to stay in business as an interstate railroad.","start":3256.006,"stop":3281.707,"duration":25.7},{"text":"Further, that the Government should not be allowed as result of this litigation to apply a

finally, we assert that the so-called terms letter defense cannot be successfully used to defeat a valid claim of this taxpayer on a substantive issue of its entitlement to depreciation deductions
