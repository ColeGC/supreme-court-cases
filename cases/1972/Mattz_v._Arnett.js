Record 3918.","start":523.316,"stop":538.411,"duration":15.09},{"text":"He specifically said that they where 40 to 60 Indians left on the old reservation at that

information.","start":553.156,"stop":558.187,"duration":5.03},{"text":"First, the census actually found 505 Indians total on both the Klamath River Reservation and the area 20 miles upstream from the Klamath River Reservation which everybody refers to as the connecting strip, and that fact is reported in Annual Report of Commissioner of Indian Affairs to Secretary of Interior year 1892, page 784.","start":558.187,"stop":582.422,"duration":24.24},{"text":"Then, according to the trial commissioner’s findings in the Short case which had been heavily relied upon by both the Commissioner and

the old reservation.","start":582.422,"stop":602.045,"duration":19.62},{"text":"So that means from a practical purposes that more than 95% of the Indians on the Klamath River Reservation lift the reservation between the time that it was originally created in 1855, and the time that the 1892 Act was before Congress, and that is the first historical fact that I think has some significance in this case.","start":602.045,"stop":621.693,"duration":19.65},{"text":"Secondly, after the Indians move out of the area, the homesteaders moved into the area.","start":621.693,"stop":628.132,"duration":6.44},{"text":"And according to the congressional debates which as I say had been quoted at length in my opening brief, most of the lands in the old

area.","start":645.116,"stop":651.228,"duration":6.11},{"text":"And many Bills were offered in the Congress through the 1818’s for the purpose of perfecting the title of these homesteaders to the lands which they occupied.","start":651.228,"stop":659.139,"duration":7.91},{"text":"The 1892 Act was a direct outgrowth of all these congressional efforts.","start":659.139,"stop":663.453,"duration":4.31},{"text":"This is the historical context that I am referring to and that I think distinguishes this case from the Seymour case and that also

benefits.","start":663.453,"stop":681.703,"duration":18.25},{"text":"Now, Congress was very greatly persuaded and influenced by these historical circumstances to which I’ve alluded is very unique

references in the legislative history to an abandoned reservation, but if you read the legislative history closely, especially the House Committee Report, you find that those references are to the
