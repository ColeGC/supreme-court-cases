is the key issue in this case today, Arnheim contended that its business was not an enterprise under the Act but rather that the employees at these buildings were employed and its many different enterprises as there were separate building owners.","start":423.615,"stop":439.434,"duration":15.82},{"text":"Finally, an issue that is not raised by either side here, there was an issue regarding the nexus to interstate commerce and the District Court held that prior to February 1, 1967, the necessary nexus did not exist and dismissed the secretary suit as to that prior period subsequent to February 1, 1967 when the statute was amended.","start":439.434,"stop":462.017,"duration":22.58},{"text":"The Court held that the necessary nexus did exist and we don’t understand that issue to be

these employees under the act.","start":468.758,"stop":478.924,"duration":10.17},{"text":"It secondly held also an agreement with the Government and with the District Court that the proper measure of gross revenues for purposes of determining coverage under Section 3 (s) of the Act is rents and not merely Arnheim’s commissions.","start":478.924,"stop":492.921,"duration":14},{"text":"However, they agreed with Arnheim that it was not conducting a single enterprise but rather as many different enterprises as they were different building owners.","start":492.921,"stop":502.856,"duration":9.94},{"text":"Accordingly, it remanded the case to the District Court for a hearing whether each of these, whether any of these separate enterprises met the dollar volume requirements of the Act to create an enterprise in which the employees would be covered.","start":502.856,"stop":517.283,"duration":14.43},{"text":"Our petition for certiorari raised solely the issue of the correctness of the Court of Appeals definition of Arnheim’s enterprise.","start":517.283,"stop":524.72,"duration":7.44},{"text":"No cross-petition was filed with respect to the issues won by the Government below nor were they raise in the brief in our position to the certiorari petition.","start":524.72,"stop":536.148,"duration":11.43},{"text":"Turning to the merits, the Government’s theory is that these employees are employed in Arnheim and Neely’s Enterprise, the management of office and apartment buildings for others and that the activities that all the buildings Arnheim manages are part of a single enterprise.","start":536.148,"stop":552.811,"duration":16.66},{"text":"Question presented to this Court is fundamentally one of interpretation of the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.","start":552.811,"stop":559.45,"duration":6.64},{"text":"We submit these provisions are acceptable of only one interpretation and that interpretation provides coverage for these employees.","start":559.45,"stop":567.876,"duration":8.43},{"text":"Let’s take John Doe, an elevator operator of one of the buildings that Arnheim manages, in order to determine whether he is protected by the minimum wage provisions which it contained in Section 6 of the Act would begin by looking at Section 6 which says every employer shall pay to each of his employees and I am skipping to the relevant part, employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce wages at certain rates.","start":567.876,"stop":596.415,"duration":28.54},{"text":"Now the phrase “engaged in the --employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce” is defined in Section 3 (s).","start":596.415,"stop":605.349,"duration":8.93},{"text":"Its there defined as an enterprise whose annual gross volume of sales made or business done is not less than $500,000 if we are talking about the period from February 1967 to January 1969.","start":605.349,"stop":620.373,"duration":15.02},{"text":"So the question is, is John Doe employed in an enterprise which has the necessary dollar volumes?","start":620.373,"stop":627.684,"duration":7.31},{"text":"Now “enterprise” as defined in Section 3 (r) and here we are the crux of the case.","start":627.684,"stop":632.92,"duration":5.24},{"text":"The relevant portion says that an enterprise means “the related activities performed either through unified operation or common control by any person or persons for a common business purpose, and includes all such activities whether performed in one or more establishments or by one or more corporate or other organizational units.”","start":632.92,"stop":657.141,"duration":24.22},{"text":"Now Arnheim’s activities as a manager of office and apartment buildings for others clearly constitute a single enterprise under this definition.","start":657.141,"stop":666.092,"duration":8.95},{"text":"There are three elements that need to be met.","start":666.092,"stop":668.515,"duration":2.42},{"text":"Are they related activities?","start":668.515,"stop":670.919,"duration":2.4},{"text":"And Congress has not defined related activities per se but the legislative history makes it clear that consider related activities to be those that are the same or similar.","start":670.919,"stop":681.583,"duration":10.66},{"text":"Looking in Arnheim’s activities that each of the office buildings and apartment buildings that have manages, it does the same thing under basically the same agreement with the building owner clearly related activities we submit.","start":681.583,"stop":694.329,"duration":12.75},{"text":"The second requirement is, are these activities performed through a unified operation or common control?","start":694.329,"stop":700.244,"duration":5.92},{"text":"Now, the common control requirement is satisfied if they’re performed by a single company.","start":700.244,"stop":704.677,"duration":4.43},{"text":"Arnheim and Neely incorporated runs the business of Arnheim and Neely, Incorporated and that’s what we are talking about here.","start":704.677,"stop":711.344,"duration":6.67},{"text":"The common control requirement is met.","start":711.344,"stop":713.993,"duration":2.65},{"text":"In addition, although it’s not necessary to meet both, Arnheim’s business of managing buildings is run through unified operations.","start":713.993,"stop":721.977,"duration":7.98},{"text":"That is out of its central Arnheim and Neely office where its management and supervisory personnel and clerical personnel work.","start":721.977,"stop":730.41,"duration":8.43},{"text":"Finally, these related activities must be engaged in, for a common business purpose.","start":730.41,"stop":736.997,"duration":6.59},{"text":"Again, we think it’s clear that the requirement is met.","start":736.997,"stop":739.527,"duration":2.53},{"text":"The emphasis of Congress was on the word “business” to distinguish between business and charitable.","start":739.527,"stop":744.941,"duration":5.41},{"text":"Here, the activities that each of the nine buildings are undertaken by Arnheim for its business purpose of managing buildings and making a profit from that activity.","start":744.941,"stop":757.933,"duration":12.99},{"text":"How then did the Court of Appeals reach a different conclusion?","start":757.933,"stop":761.608,"duration":3.67},{"text":"It did so by completely ignoring Arnheim’s enterprise and by looking instead at Arnheim’s clients the building owners.","start":761.608,"stop":768.694,"duration":7.09},{"text":"It found that the building owners did not share common business purpose that they have nine distinct enterprises.","start":768.694,"stop":775.996,"duration":7.3},{"text":"This finding was absolutely correct.","start":775.996,"stop":778.243,"duration":2.25},{"text":"We have no problem with it, whatsoever.","start":778.243,"stop":780.85,"duration":2.61},{"text":"But it’s irrelevant as applied to this case because it’s Arnheim’s enterprise in which we contend that these individuals are employed.","start":780.85,"stop":790.165,"duration":9.31},{"text":"Now, there is a fact which is perhaps overlooked by the Court of Appeals and by the respondents herein which is that under the Fair Labor Standards Act, it’s possible to be employed in more than one enterprise at the same time.","start":790.165,"stop":802.616,"duration":12.45},{"text":"And indeed that’s exactly what appears to have happened here.","start":802.616,"stop":807.303,"duration":4.69},{"text":"These persons are employed in the building owners enterprise which is to own real estate.","start":807.303,"stop":813.141,"duration":5.84},{"text":"They are employed in Arnheim and Neely’s enterprise which is to manage real estate.","start":813.141,"stop":817.815,"duration":4.67},{"text":"They are involved in both of those businesses.","start":817.815,"stop":820.409,"duration":2.59},{"text":"Now, where they are employed by more than one enterprise, if one of the enterprises comes within the coverage requirements of Section 3 (s) then the employee is protected regardless of whether the other enterprise by which he may also be employed comes within Section 3 (s) or not.","start":820.409,"stop":837.988,"duration":17.58},{"text":"Now, I think the example that we gave in our reply brief of the warehouses retaining the protective agency will illustrate the fallacy of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.","start":837.988,"stop":848.416,"duration":10.43},{"text":"Supposed you have nine separate warehouses, each completely independent business having no connection with one another.","start":848.416,"stop":855.129,"duration":6.71},{"text":"They all require security services, night watchmen, they all retain the
