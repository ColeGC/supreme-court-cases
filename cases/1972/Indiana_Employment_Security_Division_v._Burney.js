appropriate analysis, as a matter of law, there are only two.","start":640.351,"stop":656.059,"duration":15.71},{"text":"The first of these is the determination of insured status.","start":656.059,"stop":660.774,"duration":4.72},{"text":"This is merely whether the claimant has had enough work and has earned wage credits in a covered employment to be eligible for benefits if he meets the eligibility requirements.","start":660.774,"stop":676.097,"duration":15.32},{"text":"This determination says nothing about whether the person is eligible or not eligible.","start":676.097,"stop":681.521,"duration":5.42},{"text":"In fact, a person can even request this determination when he is still employed.","start":681.521,"stop":686.383,"duration":4.86},{"text":"The second determination goes to eligibility and this, I have broken down into two parts.","start":686.383,"stop":692.536,"duration":6.15},{"text":"The first issue, going to the reason for termination of the prior employment, that is basically whether the termination was attributable to the employer or to the employee.","start":692.536,"stop":708.611,"duration":16.08},{"text":"The third issue, which is involved in this case is a continuing question of the conduct of the claimant during the period of the unemployment.","start":708.611,"stop":722.045,"duration":13.43},{"text":"Each week, the claimant is required to well, continue to be unemployed, to be able to work, to be available for work, to be making an independent effort to secure work, to not have refused an offer of a suitable job or not have refused instructions by Division to apply for a job which would be suitable.","start":722.045,"stop":747.85,"duration":25.81},{"text":"This determination is made each week by the Division and it is on this basis that the determination of eligibility for that week is made.","start":747.85,"stop":760.358,"duration":12.51},{"text":"There is never any determination by the Division which would have any effect for any week prior -- past the time of that week.","start":760.358,"stop":770.831,"duration":10.47},{"text":"This is like, in a sense, pay for looking for work and you don't get paid until after you have done the job.","start":770.831,"stop":782.203,"duration":11.37},{"text":"When a person comes in each week to present his claim, he is required to establish that he has met these criteria.","start":782.203,"stop":795.695,"duration":13.49},{"text":"This establishment may come about by his certification, upon the voucher form that he has met these requirements.","start":795.695,"stop":804.99,"duration":9.29},{"text":"It may come by an interview or a hearing, an interview type hearing with a Claims Deputy.","start":804.99,"stop":815.038,"duration":10.05},{"text":"This hearing would be basically similar to the hearing on an initial claim which was described by this Court in its opinion in the Case of California Department of Human Resources Development versus Java.","start":815.038,"stop":831.929,"duration":16.89},{"text":"The party, the claimant is called in, the question which raises the doubt is discussed.","start":831.929,"stop":843.478,"duration":11.55},{"text":"If there is anyone else who would have information, the Deputy finds that information and he reaches a determination of whether or not the person was eligible for that particular week.","start":843.478,"stop":859.616,"duration":16.14},{"text":"That decision is as much an initial decision in that sense as is the first week.","start":859.616,"stop":867.591,"duration":7.98},{"text":"The only difference being that in the normal situation, it is not necessary each week to determine the questions of why the previous employment was terminated.","start":867.591,"stop":884.443,"duration":16.85},{"text":"In this case, Mrs. Burney was determined by the Division, by the Deputy not to be available for work in that she was unduly restricting the hours for which she was available for work and the other case was presenting the same issue, in the New York case of Torres, there was the plaintiff Mr. Dinger who was found

offer of suitable work.","start":930.388,"stop":938.59,"duration":8.2},{"text":"When these questions arose, it was necessary to make a determination of the prior week's conduct because each of these questions is a condition precedent to eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits.","start":938.59,"stop":957.339,"duration":18.75},{"text":"This is a different type of system than the welfare system, in which there is an initial determination of status such as a family has a child or children who are dependent within the definition of 42 U.S.C Section 606, that is, a needy child living with a designated relative who is deprived of the parental support of at least one parent.","start":957.339,"stop":989.043,"duration":31.7},{"text":"In those cases, once a determination is made, it

all.","start":1024.586,"stop":1033.492,"duration":8.91},{"text":"In looking to this Court's decision in Java last year which was held by the District Court to be dispositive of the issue, I believe

determination by the Deputy in the California Department, as to the eligibility of a particular claimant.","start":1057.84,"stop":1073.351,"duration":15.51},{"text":"After that determination had been made, one of the parties to that case filed a notice appeal and that notice or appeal was sufficient in itself to call for determination of benefits, even though in that case, the Division had determined that the benefits were due.","start":1073.351,"stop":1097.328,"duration":23.98},{"text":"So, you were allowing a party to upset the decision of the impartial
