is particularly true in a context of an American bankruptcy of an international company because the assets in Switzerland or other foreign jurisdictions would not be under the jurisdiction in the American Bankruptcy Court, and creditors may very well have chosen to inquire into company accounts abroad so that they might seek some form of ansulary of bankruptcy.","start":566.146,"stop":599.729,"duration":33.58},{"text":"There was indeed one in Spain.","start":599.729,"stop":601.486,"duration":1.76},{"text":"A creditor may have chosen to go into Switzerland, and that’s another reason, Mr. Chief Justice, when I say it’s not all that clear that this was an evasive answer.","start":601.486,"stop":611.769,"duration":10.28},{"text":"Judge Lumbard proceeded on the assumption that he must have been talking about a personal account, but when you reflect upon the problems of international bankruptcies of companies with assets all over the world, it’s not unreasonable to believe that the witness thought he was being asked about the company’s accounts.","start":611.769,"stop":630.612,"duration":18.84},{"text":"He asked- he answered about the company’s accounts and if the question meant personal, he could’ve said so.","start":630.612,"stop":638.417,"duration":7.81},{"text":"But, if we assume, as Judge Lumbard said, that it was not ambiguous but was directed to a personal account, then the questioner could not have been put off.","start":638.417,"stop":651.579,"duration":13.16},{"text":"It was patently unresponsive.","start":651.579,"stop":653.667,"duration":2.09},{"text":"It was about a company account, and that raises then the second question of whether a truthful and clearly unresponsive answer should be the basis for a criminal conviction of perjury.","start":653.667,"stop":671.653,"duration":17.99},{"text":"Now, there’s that second question which, I think, raises the most intriguing conceptual problems and which the Court may very well wish to ask more questions about, but I have chosen to argue first the question of ambiguity for the purpose of the clarity of the argument.","start":671.653,"stop":690.897,"duration":19.24},{"text":"I think you will find that if we discuss that first the whole discussion will proceed in a more easily followed

absolute maximum forthcoming type of candor and disclosure, but that’s a far cry from dealing with the question of a layman being asked questions by a lawyer who is satisfied with the answer, does not go on to ask the next question, and to put the layman in jail or to brand him a felon and, that, I submit, is the issue here.","start":741.723,"stop":774.833,"duration":33.11},{"text":"It’s obvious
