appeal to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which presents two basically unrelated issues.","start":59.279,"stop":70.922,"duration":11.64},{"text":"The first issue is whether in a civil antitrust case, the Government may challenge validity of patents which although not relied upon by the defendants as a defense to the antitrust charge and nevertheless involved in the antitrust violations case.","start":70.922,"stop":90.247,"duration":19.33},{"text":"And the second issue is whether the relief given by the District Court in this case was inadequate.","start":90.247,"stop":96.901,"duration":6.65},{"text":"The appellees, the Glaxo Group Ltd. and Imperial Chemical Industries Inc, which I should refer to as ICI, are two British drug firms.","start":96.901,"stop":108.056,"duration":11.16},{"text":"The drug involved in this case is an antibiotic called Griseofulvin.","start":108.056,"stop":114.427,"duration":6.37},{"text":"Griseofulvin itself is an old product and is unpatented and for many years was used as fungicide in the treatment of fungus infection of plants.","start":114.427,"stop":125.617,"duration":11.19},{"text":"In the 1950s, ICI discovered that if Griseofulvin was taken internally, it would be able to cure various fungus infections such as ringworms on the skin of people and animals.","start":125.617,"stop":142.623,"duration":17.01},{"text":"And as a result of these discoveries, in 1959, ICI obtained a patent upon this new use of the drug.","start":142.623,"stop":153.224,"duration":10.6},{"text":"The patent contained two basic claims.","start":153.224,"stop":156.835,"duration":3.61},{"text":"The first was a so-called method claim which consisted of a method of curing external fungus infections of animals and people by the administration of what they describe as an effective amount of Griseofulvin.","start":156.835,"stop":174.764,"duration":17.93},{"text":"The second claim was a so-called product claim.","start":174.764,"stop":177.45,"duration":2.69},{"text":"It was described as pill, a capsule or a container containing an effective amount of Griseofulvin which would accomplish this objective.","start":177.45,"stop":186.999,"duration":9.55},{"text":"And this is the basic patent, these two claims which the government is here challenging.","start":186.999,"stop":193.031,"duration":6.03},{"text":"In 1967, the other appellee Glaxo obtained a United States patent on an improved form of Griseofulvin, the so-called micro size form of the drug, which is very much ground up in very small particles which is proven to be much more effective than the original form, which is the one now of principal commercial significance.","start":193.031,"stop":218.57,"duration":25.54},{"text":"Between 1957 and 1960, the two appellees had extensive discussions, looking to a pooling of their patents and cross-licensing, and in 1960, they reach such an agreement under which the patents on Griseofulvin of the two companies were pooled and they cross-licensed each other.","start":218.57,"stop":240.057,"duration":21.49},{"text":"And in addition to that, in this agreement, ICI agreed that it would use its best endeavors to make sure that its licensees did not sell Griseofulvin in bulk to third persons without the consent of Glaxo.","start":240.057,"stop":259.305,"duration":19.25},{"text":"In 1962, ICI appointed the American Home Products Corporation, an American firm as its exclusive distributor of Griseofulvin.","start":259.305,"stop":270.353,"duration":11.05},{"text":"It previously had appointed this firm as its exclusive distributor for other drugs.","start":270.353,"stop":275.913,"duration":5.56},{"text":"And in its license to American Home Products, it required an agreement that American Home Products in turn would not sell this drug in bulk to any third persons without the written permission of ICI.","start":275.913,"stop":292.546,"duration":16.63},{"text":"Shortly before this, Glaxo had granted similar, made a similar agreement with two other American firms, Schering Corporation and Johnson & Johnson, appointing them as distributors for the drug Griseofulvin in the United States and the agreements of Glaxo with these two licensees similarly provide that the licensees could not sell in bulk without the written approval of the licensor.","start":292.546,"stop":323.744,"duration":31.2},{"text":"Each of these agreements gave the people cross-licenses under the patents.","start":323.744,"stop":329.964,"duration":6.22},{"text":"That is Glaxo license under its own and ICI’s patents, ICI license under its and the Glaxo patent, and each of these was in form, the form of a patent licensing agreement.","start":329.964,"stop":343.006,"duration":13.04},{"text":"That is they -- in addition to the bulk sales restriction, the basic agreement was they licensed them to manufacture and sell under the patents and each of the licensees was required to pay a royalty to the licensor based upon the total amount of the Griseofulvin which they purchased from the English firms and sold.","start":343.006,"stop":366.387,"duration":23.38},{"text":"Now, although the license has permitted the American firms to manufacture, the fact is that throughout this entire period, all three of the American licensees purchased all of their Griseofulvin from the English firms.","start":366.387,"stop":381.748,"duration":15.36},{"text":"During this entire period, neither Glaxo nor ICI made any bulk sales to anyone, other than the three licensees and the three licensees themselves made no bulk sales at all to anyone in the United States.","start":381.748,"stop":398.51,"duration":16.76},{"text":"Shortly before this suit was filed when the appellees were informed that the Justice Department was investigating the legality of these bulk sales restrictions, they canceled them.","start":398.51,"stop":412.182,"duration":13.67},{"text":"Since that time, American Home Products Corporation has made a few sales of the Griseofulvin, not in bulk, but in the capsule form.","start":412.182,"stop":423.518,"duration":11.34},{"text":"Now when this government suit was filed in March 1968, the three licensees together had a 100% of the market and at the time the record was closed a couple of years later they had 98.5% of the market.","start":423.518,"stop":439.903,"duration":16.39},{"text":"The government suit alleged that the bulk sales limitations contained in the licenses and also in the ICI, Glaxo patent pooling arrangement violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.","start":439.903,"stop":454.887,"duration":14.98},{"text":"The Government complaint also challenged the ICI patent on two grounds.","start":454.887,"stop":460.918,"duration":6.03},{"text":"We contended that the method patent was invalid, because it did not disclose how to practice the invention, since it’s nowhere stated what was an effective amount of Griseofulvin, and of course, the patent, the idea that was patented was the administration of an effective amount necessary to cure these diseases.","start":460.918,"stop":481.031,"duration":20.11},{"text":"As we said, all that it said was an effective amount and that didn’t sufficiently disclose the method of practice in the invention

violation.","start":518.616,"stop":534.129,"duration":15.51},{"text":"Of course, here our allegation is that these bulk sales agreements restrictions were invalid and these of course will brought the patent licensing agreements.","start":534.129,"stop":544.912,"duration":10.78},{"text":"Now we also challenged the so-called product claim on the ground that all this was, was a new use of the well-known product and if you couldn’t get a product claim on that that could only be patented under the method claim.","start":544.912,"stop":561.763,"duration":16.85},{"text":"Though it is not in this case a trial in the traditional sense, the case was decided on various motions for partial summary judgment.","start":561.763,"stop":570.206,"duration":8.44},{"text":"However, an extensive record was produced, it occupies 400 pages in this Court and extensive facts were developed through affidavits, through depositions, through stipulations, through various documents.","start":570.206,"stop":584.886,"duration":14.68},{"text":"The District Court held that the ban upon the sales of bulk of the Griseofulvin and both the patent licensing agreements and the cross-licensing agreements was per se violation of section one of the Sherman Act, because under this Court’s decision in the Schwinn case in 388 U.S.","start":584.886,"stop":606.602,"duration":21.72},{"text":"It was an impermissible restraint by the manufacture upon alienation.","start":606.602,"stop":612.123,"duration":5.52},{"text":"That is

licensees.","start":612.123,"stop":624.92,"duration":12.8},{"text":"The District Court however, struck from the complaint the allegations with respect to the invalidity of the patents.","start":624.92,"stop":632.024,"duration":7.1},{"text":"The court said that the government had no standing to litigate this issue and there were two grounds of its decision -- it’s really one ground.","start":632.024,"stop":639.377,"duration":7.35},{"text":"What it said was as it interpreted the prior decisions of this Court, the government may challenge the validity of a patent only in two circumstances.","start":639.377,"stop":648.45,"duration":9.07},{"text":"One, where it is alleged the patent has been obtained by fraud on the Patent Office.","start":648.45,"stop":653.277,"duration":4.83},{"text":"There was no such claim here.","start":653.277,"stop":654.958,"duration":1.68},{"text":"Two, where the defendants rely upon the patent as a defense to the antitrust case, and since the defendants here, the expressed it, one of the ICI had disavowed the reliance on the patent is concluded that the government had no standing and consistent with that decision, it also denied the government’s motion to file an amended complaint, which among, other things, would have also challenged the validity of the later Glaxo patent.","start":654.958,"stop":684.55,"duration":29.59},{"text":"The judgment the District Court entered in this case prohibits the appellees from participating, adhering, enforcing it anyway, agreement prohibiting or limiting the resale in bulk of not only Griseofulvin but of all drugs that it sells in the United States.","start":684.55,"stop":705.643,"duration":21.09},{"text":"The District Court however refused to grant two other provisions which the government asserted was essential to dissipate the effects of this illegal conduct.","start":705.643,"stop":715.299,"duration":9.66},{"text":"That is, we said in addition to that the Court should order the appellees themselves to grant licenses in bulk as long as they sell in the United States on reasonable, nondiscriminatory terms and in addition we urge that they should be required to grant licenses under their patents at reasonable royalties.","start":715.299,"stop":735.677,"duration":20.38},{"text":"And I will discus the facts relating to the need for this relief when I come to discus the relief portions of the case.","start":735.677,"stop":743.878,"duration":8.2},{"text":"Now, under this Court’s decision in the Gypsum case, there is no question that if the defendants rely upon a patent as a defense to a antitrust case involving patents, the government then has standing to challenge the patents.","start":743.878,"stop":761.208,"duration":17.33},{"text":"In the Gypsum case, what happened was the government alleged that an industry wide price-fixing system resulting from the series of patent licenses violated the Sherman Act.","start":761.208,"stop":773.171,"duration":11.96},{"text":"The defendants in that case admitted that if their patents didn’t provide a defense, their conduct was illegal.","start":773.171,"stop":780.337,"duration":7.17},{"text":"But they asserted the patents did provide a defense.","start":780.337,"stop":783.47,"duration":3.13},{"text":"At that point, the government then moved to amend the complaint to challenge the validity of the patents.","start":783.47,"stop":789.804,"duration":6.33},{"text":"The District Court refused to permit the government to do that, saying that if you permitted the government in an antitrust suit to challenge the validity of patents that would involve a collateral attack upon the decision of Commissioner of Patents granting a patent, and that the statute do not permit such collateral attack.","start":789.804,"stop":809.692,"duration":19.89},{"text":"When the case came to this Court on the government’s appeal, the Court said it was actually unnecessary to decide that issue because it concluded that what the defendants had done in that case could not be justified by their patents.","start":809.692,"stop":823.879,"duration":14.19},{"text":"But it said that because of the significance of the issue was unwise to leave that holding as a precedent, and therefore took pains to correct.","start":823.879,"stop":833.452,"duration":9.57},{"text":"And I would like to read to the Court the ground on which this Court held that the District Court had erred in Gypsum in saying that government couldn’t rely on the patents.","start":833.452,"stop":843.432,"duration":9.98},{"text":"It’s in 333 U.S. of Pages 387-388.","start":843.432,"stop":848.214,"duration":4.78},{"text":"The Court said, “In an antitrust suit, instituted by a licensee against his licensor, we have repeatedly held that the licensee may attack the validity of the patent under which he was licensed.”","start":848.214,"stop":861.446,"duration":13.23},{"text":"And now I stress these words “because of the public interest in free competition”, even though the licensee has agreed in his license not to do so.","start":861.446,"stop":871.07,"duration":9.62},{"text":"That is the public interest in free competition method.","start":871.07,"stop":873.805,"duration":2.73},{"text":"Even though, the licensee had said he wouldn’t attack the patent, nevertheless he should be given the right to do so.","start":873.805,"stop":879.384,"duration":5.58},{"text":"And the Court then concluded in a suit to vindicate the public interest by enjoining violations of the Sherman Act, that is a suit to vindicate the public interest as distinguished from the private interest involved in the private suit.","start":879.384,"stop":892.316,"duration":12.93},{"text":"The United States should have the same opportunity to show that the asserted shield of patentability does not exist.","start":892.316,"stop":899.908,"duration":7.59},{"text":"Now, of course, as our opponents argue vigorously, this is a different case, because here they haven’t relied upon the patents as a defense, but we think the basic rational of that case and the whole theory of all of this Court’s decisions dealing with the interrelationship of patents and the antitrust laws calls for the same result in this case.","start":899.908,"stop":924.986,"duration":25.08},{"text":"This Court, in recent years, has frequently recognized as it said Lear against Adkins, the important public interest in permitting free and full competition in the use of ideas which are in realty a part of the public domain and the strong federal policy favoring that interest and in Lear against Adkins, it also
