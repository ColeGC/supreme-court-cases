Districts.","start":338.756,"stop":358.904,"duration":20.15},{"text":"In other words, those districts were combined into a single district which of course, represented an anomaly as far as the Senate

mentioned that the plans were forwarded to the Attorney General of the United States, the Attorney General filed with State objections under the Voting Rights Act in two respects.","start":384.392,"stop":395.187,"duration":10.8},{"text":"One, the division line between Senate Districts five and six which I have just referred to, and also to the five multi-member

General Assembly reconvened, but this Court had not decided the Chavis case.","start":412.921,"stop":419.591,"duration":6.67},{"text":"The Lower court had not acted and consequently, the General

it.","start":419.591,"stop":435.778,"duration":16.19},{"text":"On May the 24th, the Court entered an order on first hearing, which said in essence that on or before June 15th, 1971, Virginia was to adopt and submit to the Attorney General of the United States, curative legislation with respect to the two objections I have just mentioned.","start":435.778,"stop":455.622,"duration":19.84},{"text":"If that were not done by that date, then the Court would proceed the trial.","start":455.622,"stop":460.772,"duration":5.15},{"text":"On June the 3rd, the General Assembly came back into session.","start":460.772,"stop":464.979,"duration":4.21},{"text":"Senate Bill 125 was introduced to cure the Attorney General's objections to the Senate plan, which constituted the drawing of a single line between the fifth and sixth Districts.","start":464.979,"stop":477.349,"duration":12.37},{"text":"And then, the General Assembly recessed until June, the 7th, to await this Court’s decision in Chavis versus Whitcomb.","start":477.349,"stop":485.206,"duration":7.86},{"text":"On June the 7th, Chavis versus Whitcomb was decided.","start":485.206,"stop":488.634,"duration":3.43},{"text":"The Attorney General of the United States withdrew his objections to the House plan.","start":488.634,"stop":494.19,"duration":5.56},{"text":"The General Assembly passed Senate Bill 125, curing the objection with respect to the Senate line in districts five and six.","start":494.19,"stop":503.985,"duration":9.8},{"text":"Consequently, the Court’s order, which I refer to on May 24th, was fully complied with and so the General Assembly recessed until August 16th, the subject of course, to being reconvened earlier for the Court to decide the issues before it.","start":503.985,"stop":520.517,"duration":16.53},{"text":"On June the 16th, there was such a hearing.","start":520.517,"stop":522.818,"duration":2.3},{"text":"On July the 2nd, the Court in its order found the plans constitutionally defective, but instead of permitting the General Assembly to come back into session and to act on the guidelines established in the Court’s opinion as to what in fact would be a constitutionally appropriate, reapportionment plan proceeded to mandate on itself.","start":522.818,"stop":547.889,"duration":25.07},{"text":"On July 8th, the General Assembly reconvened, directed the Attorney General of the Commonwealth to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of the United States and adjourn since there was nothing further, which the General Assembly of Virginia could do under those circumstances.","start":547.889,"stop":564.372,"duration":16.48},{"text":"Thus today, we start a second round or second decade of reapportionment litigation with the hope that guidelines maybe established in order that states throughout the country will not be faced with subsequent rounds of litigation as to what in fact is constitutionally permitted in terms of the drawing of legislated district lines.","start":564.372,"stop":591.074,"duration":26.7},{"text":"I want to address myself for a few minutes to the House plan and then to the Senate plan and then I will cease at that point and Mr. Frazier will deliver his argument.","start":591.074,"stop":602.413,"duration":11.34},{"text":"With respect to the House, the lower court’s decision was based on numbers and numbers alone when it struck down the validity of the Virginia House and Delegate's plan.","start":602.413,"stop":613.773,"duration":11.36},{"text":"The lower court relying on this Court’s previous decisions in Kirkpatrick and Wells, both of course being congressional redistricting cases, not state legislative cases, found variations exceeding those which were struck down in those two cases.","start":613.773,"stop":634.238,"duration":20.47},{"text":"Now, if numbers must be the sole criteria of the Virginia plan, we submit that the Court should not have looked only at the maximum variation of plus 9.6% and minus 6.8% depending on the calculations of the floater district concept.","start":634.238,"stop":655.361,"duration":21.12},{"text":"It should have considered that of 52 house districts, 35 were within 4% of the norm, that of 52 house districts, only two exceeded 8%, that of 52 house districts, the average deviation from the norm was only 3.8%, that of the 52 house districts, a majority of the delegates elected by or in those districts would be elected by 49.3% of the population of the State.","start":655.361,"stop":686.41,"duration":31.05},{"text":"But we further submit that numbers and numbers alone viewed in the manner in which the lower court viewed them on the overall aspect as I have just presented them to you, cannot be what this Court meant in Reynolds versus Sims when it stated that “one man, one vote” means an individual is entitled to fair and effective representation.","start":686.41,"stop":708.792,"duration":22.38},{"text":"That is the constitutional criteria which we submit must be met.","start":708.792,"stop":713.234,"duration":4.44},{"text":"It cannot be numerically measured alone for purposes of State legislative reapportionment.","start":713.234,"stop":719.487,"duration":6.25},{"text":"But it can be, we submit, measured by two-pronged test.","start":719.487,"stop":723.514,"duration":4.03},{"text":"One, is the apportionment of the house in question based on a permissible standard.","start":723.514,"stop":730.652,"duration":7.14},{"text":"Two, there is the plan approached population equality as closely as possible in consistency with that rationale.","start":730.652,"stop":740.964,"duration":10.31},{"text":"The rationale of the Virginia plan is very simple.","start":740.964,"stop":744.369,"duration":3.4},{"text":"It is one suggested by this Court that a State can accord political subdivisions, some independent representation and at least one body of the State legislature, as long as the basic standard of equality of population among districts is maintained.","start":744.369,"stop":763.327,"duration":18.96},{"text":"That was the rationale adopted in Virginia and today it is more important than ever before under the newly adopted Virginia Constitution because under this Constitution which went into effect in 1971, counties of which we have 95 in the State as well as cities are given the opportunity to have enacted for them numerous local or special legislation applicable to specific problems which that jurisdiction as a jurisdiction, maybe confronted with.","start":763.327,"stop":792.476,"duration":29.15},{"text":"Now the second test that we suggest was also met.","start":792.476,"stop":796.074,"duration":3.6},{"text":"The lower court specifically found that disparities in the Virginia plan cannot be reduced at all if the integrity of political subdivisions are mandated.","start":796.074,"stop":810.008,"duration":13.93},{"text":"No plan has been presented, which keeping intact local political subdivision boundaries for one House of a bicameral legislature achieves closer population equality.","start":810.008,"stop":822.846,"duration":12.84},{"text":"How then can the lower court’s decision as to the house plan be upheld?","start":822.846,"stop":827.868,"duration":5.02},{"text":"Only in two ways, neither of which were sustainable in this instance.","start":827.868,"stop":832.164,"duration":4.3},{"text":"First that the Court finds, that the rationale or the Virginia plan, is one that is not permissible or is one that was not rationally applied.","start":832.164,"stop":842.96,"duration":10.8},{"text":"According to political subdivisions, independent representation is, we submit, permissible.","start":842.96,"stop":849.339,"duration":6.38},{"text":"The policy of Virginia in this regard was rationally applied.","start":849.339,"stop":854.435,"duration":5.1},{"text":"Appellant Duval's argument that there is no provision in the Virginia constitution allowing independent representation ignores a basic constitutional principle and that is that a State Constitution is a document of limitation.","start":854.435,"stop":866.704,"duration":12.27},{"text":"Nothing in Virginia’s Constitution prohibits according to political subdivisions independent representation.","start":866.704,"stop":874.503,"duration":7.8},{"text":"Virginia has not abandoned her policy, a traditional policy of according political subdivisions independent representation.","start":874.503,"stop":881.766,"duration":7.26},{"text":"She did change this policy as far as the Senate is concerned but clearly, in light with this Court’s language and opinion in Reynolds versus Sims, this does not mandate an abandonment of this policy in the House also.","start":881.766,"stop":894.936,"duration":13.17},{"text":"In fact, the design of Virginia’s reapportionment was to balance the two Houses of her General Assembly in this respect.","start":894.936,"stop":903.972,"duration":9.04},{"text":"The only other manner in which the decision of the Lower court can be sustained is if this Court now decides that the principles of congressional redistricting are also applicable to legislative redistricting.","start":903.972,"stop":916.032,"duration":12.06},{"text":"We submit, they are none; for if there were numbers and numbers alone which we're concerned with, there would be no need to determine whether various rationales, as suggested by this Court in previous opinions could be applied because the only rationale would be numbers.","start":916.032,"stop":933.101,"duration":17.07},{"text":"There would be no need to determine whether one House of a bicameral legislature balances inequities in another House.","start":933.101,"stop":940.854,"duration":7.75},{"text":"Now for this Court to make applicable to legislative redistricting, the congressional redistricting decisions would repudiate its past enunciation that numbers and numbers alone, though most important, are not the sole criteria, that a balancing concept of a bicameral legislature is constitutionally acceptable, and that the maintenance of political subdivisions is a permissible, a rationale.","start":940.854,"stop":965.978,"duration":25.12},{"text":"Congressional redistricting, allocating representatives to Congress is entirely different from allocating State delegates for each State’s legislative processes.","start":965.978,"stop":976.21,"duration":10.23},{"text":"The relationship of congressional districts to the Federal Government simply cannot be compared with that of legislative districts or to a State Government for reasons I have previously assigned.","start":976.21,"stop":986.968,"duration":10.76},{"text":"There is one other way in which the court’s decision below may be sustained and that is for this Court to agree with everything that has been stated here today, within the State that nonetheless percentage variation is impermissible, that the percentage is too much.","start":986.968,"stop":1002.951,"duration":15.98},{"text":"But for this Court to say that would be saying it on the basis of numbers and numbers alone.","start":1002.951,"stop":1008.665,"duration":5.71},{"text":"For we have already demonstrated that Virginia has applied a permissible rationale in a consisted manner and we have come as close to population equality as possible in conformity with that rationale.","start":1008.665,"stop":1022.926,"duration":14.26},{"text":"The last aspect to the lower court’s decision, which affected the House of Delegates plan was the removal of the delegate from Tidewater area to Northern Virginia.","start":1022.926,"stop":1031.306,"duration":8.38},{"text":"This was done essentially on the basis of projected population growth.","start":1031.306,"stop":1036.424,"duration":5.12},{"text":"The Virginia General Assembly did not use population projections and this non-use, we submit, is permissible.","start":1036.424,"stop":1043.255,"duration":6.83},{"text":"In any event, to apply the population projections only in one part of the State rather than utilize them consistently and rationally throughout the State, clearly is contrary to the Ad Hoc application, which this Court discouraged in Kirkpatrick.","start":1043.255,"stop":1058.434,"duration":15.18},{"text":"I do not have to stand here and argue why the General Assembly did not use population projection.","start":1058.434,"stop":1063.021,"duration":4.59},{"text":"As seen in the appendix at page 66, the projections on the basis of fertility assumptions, industrial development, present and planned highway and many other considerations, all of which the General Assembly felt too speculative for proper utilization.","start":1063.021,"stop":1079.22,"duration":16.2},{"text":"As far as the Senate is concerned, there is one simple issue.","start":1079.22,"stop":1083.909,"duration":4.69},{"text":"May apportionment be based on the decennial census or must have been based on a sample housing survey conducted by a review of zip codes. Virginia adopted two policies with respect to the Senate.","start":1083.909,"stop":1096.615,"duration":12.71},{"text":"The first policy was that the entire Senate would consist of single-member districts.","start":1096.615,"stop":1101.279,"duration":4.66},{"text":"One does not have to read many cases to come to the conclusion that this is a matter peculiarly within the expertise of various state legislatures.","start":1101.279,"stop":1110.316,"duration":9.04},{"text":"And the second choice that Virginia made was the adoption of a total population apportionment base.","start":1110.316,"stop":1116.55,"duration":6.23},{"text":"Obviously, there are various basis which a state might adopt, but in Virginia, the intent, as demonstrated in the debates of the Virginia constitutional revisions as quoted in our reply brief on page 8, was for redistricting to include every human being living and counted, balloted at decennial census of the United States Government.","start":1116.55,"stop":1140.936,"duration":24.39},{"text":"That means that the lower court was faced with what we submit, were two valid constitutional policies.","start":1140.936,"stop":1146.641,"duration":5.71},{"text":"It ignored both.","start":1146.641,"stop":1148.228,"duration":1.59},{"text":"It found that the apportionment base was not proper simply because a sample zip code housing survey showed that of the 36,000 sailors enumerated aboard vessels, approximately 50% had addresses outside the Fifth Senatorial District.","start":1148.228,"stop":1162.602,"duration":14.37},{"text":"If the Court had bothered to consistently apply this sample housing survey, it would have seen that the survey at least purported to show that not only that 18,000 had addresses outside the fifth senatorial district, but that approximately half of these addresses, in other words 9,000 or 9,500 were outside of the fifth, sixth and seventh senatorial districts because they lived in other jurisdictions in the Hampton roads area, the cities of Portsmouth and Chesapeake, the cities of Newport News and Hampton.","start":1162.602,"stop":1195.737,"duration":33.13},{"text":"And I think it is well-settled that a State has great latitude in choosing its own apportionment base and I submit that the base chosen by Virginia is constitutionally permissible and consequently should be approved by this Court.","start":1195.737,"stop":1208.713,"duration":12.98},{"text":"Thank you.","start":1208.713,"stop":1222.153,"duration":13.44}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.
