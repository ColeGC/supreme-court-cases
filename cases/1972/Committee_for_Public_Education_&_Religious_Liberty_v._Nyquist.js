cleaning, janitorial and custodial services; snow removal; necessary upkeep and renovation of buildings, grounds and equipment; fire and accident protection; and such other items as the commissioner, as the state Commissioner of Education may deem necessary to ensure the health, welfare and safety of enrolled pupils.","start":210.208,"stop":252.833,"duration":42.63},{"text":"Indeed I think it is fair to say that except for teacher salaries, this statute permits practically the state and directs the state to pick up the bill for everything in those schools.","start":252.833,"stop":274.437,"duration":21.6},{"text":"Now, the only qualifications under the statute are that the schools be located in low income areas.","start":274.437,"stop":286.073,"duration":11.64},{"text":"The amount given to the schools for that purpose is $30 per pupil in attendance and an additional $10.00 if the school is more than 25 years old.","start":286.073,"stop":302.001,"duration":15.93},{"text":"Now, in Lemon against Kurtzman and Earley against DiCenso, this Court in 1971 declared unconstitutional the state laws in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island which appropriated public funds to pay for the secular teaching in religious schools.","start":302.001,"stop":333.346,"duration":31.35},{"text":"On the same day, the Court decided these cases, it decided Tilton against Richardson which upheld on its face, not necessarily as applied, indeed quite clearly not as applied, a Federal statute which appropriated funds to pay half the cost of constructing facilities, colleges.","start":333.346,"stop":358.664,"duration":25.32},{"text":"Now, in Tilton against Richardson, the plurality opinion, there was no court opinion, distinguished the Federal statute, the add from the statutes in the Pennsylvania and Rhode Island cases.","start":358.664,"stop":379.616,"duration":20.95},{"text":"The Court said, in the first place, the federal statute deals with colleges and universities, and there was a rare latitude given by the Establishment Clause, under in such circumstances, because the students are mature, they can resist pressure by the teachers, sectarian pressure in other reasons and therefore the limits of governmental action are somewhat broader, are broader than those in elementary and secondary schools.","start":379.616,"stop":421.42,"duration":41.8},{"text":"Secondly, the Court pointed out that we had there a one-time grant in each of those cases.","start":421.42,"stop":431.709,"duration":10.29},{"text":"The money is given to that state whereas in the DiCenso and Lemon cases, there was ongoing payments each year, therefore there was a greater area of governmental involvement.","start":431.709,"stop":452.27,"duration":20.56},{"text":"Finally, the Court pointed out that in the federal grant, the Tilton grant, the statute specifically forbade the use of any of those facilities partly financed with public funds to be used for religious purposes and indeed in that case, the Court held unconstitutional by unanimously that part of the federal statute which restricted, which removed this limitation after 20 years.","start":452.27,"stop":490.954,"duration":38.68},{"text":"After 20 years under the statute, those federally financed facilities could be used for religious instruction; the Court said this is unconstitutional.","start":490.954,"stop":500.509,"duration":9.56},{"text":"No funds which come from governmental body maybe used to finance any facility used in whole or in part for religious instruction or worship.","start":500.509,"stop":516.001,"duration":15.49},{"text":"Now, in the present case, the statute applies to elementary and secondary schools not to colleges.","start":516.001,"stop":530.24,"duration":14.24},{"text":"Moreover it is not a one-time-grant, but it's -- you have to renew it each year, and perhaps above all, the statute does not forbid the use of the facilities so financed governmental funds for religious or sectarian purposes.","start":530.24,"stop":560.109,"duration":29.87}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

one.","start":561.747,"stop":565.078,"duration":3.33},{"text":"The same rooms which are financed, whose lighting, whose ventilation whose upkeep, whose renovation, is financed with state funds are used for sectarian instruction and religious worship.","start":565.078,"stop":585.157,"duration":20.08},{"text":"If that was a chapel in school as many of the schools to have chapels, that chapel too is part of the cost of maintenance and repair borne by the state.","start":585.157,"stop":601.286,"duration":16.13},{"text":"The statute provides that only 50% of the average state cost of maintenance and repair of public schools maybe appropriated towards these schools, and in no case more than 100 % of money is actually used for these purposes in the parochial schools maybe used.","start":601.286,"stop":624.469,"duration":23.18},{"text":"But there is no distinction within the statute between those parts of the bill indeed it's questionable whether it could be, but those parts of building used for religious purposes and those for sectarian purposes.","start":624.469,"stop":637.292,"duration":12.82},{"text":"Now I do not believe.","start":637.292,"stop":640.394,"duration":3.1},{"text":"And in fact as I read the briefs, there is I believe an implicit admission that if this statute applied to all nonpublic schools, it would clearly be unconstitutional.","start":640.394,"stop":656.264,"duration":15.87},{"text":"I don't see how it can be denied.","start":656.264,"stop":659.324,"duration":3.06},{"text":"There was an effort to justify the statute on the police power of the state to provide for safety and health of students.","start":659.324,"stop":671.985,"duration":12.66},{"text":"While the police power has to be exercised within the restrictions of the First Amendment.","start":671.985,"stop":680.528,"duration":8.54},{"text":"In Flast against Cohen, this Court held that there is an express provision in the constitution, the First Amendment forbidding governmental financing of parochial schools.","start":680.528,"stop":695.198,"duration":14.67},{"text":"I do not know of any case in which a court has held that where there is an express provision in the constitution that can't be transgressed under the police power.","start":695.198,"stop":708.138,"duration":12.94},{"text":"The police power of the state is inherent.","start":708.138,"stop":711.299,"duration":3.16},{"text":"It is used to -- the word police, it's origin is the use of security and safety for people, to arrest criminals or those who are charged with crime and to try them, convict them, and punish them, but that doesn't mean that it's the police power.","start":711.299,"stop":731.553,"duration":20.25},{"text":"A state can't violate an express prohibition against double jeopardy let us say or trial without jury or trial without counsel.","start":731.553,"stop":739.886,"duration":8.33},{"text":"Surely the police -- the public has an interest, the state has an interest in the education of children, but it must be exercised in such way that it does not follow a specific prohibition of the Bill of Rights.","start":739.886,"stop":754.705,"duration":14.82},{"text":"No matter how wise, no matter how effective a trial without jury, or double jeopardy, or trial without counsel would be in preventing crimes speaks, that cannot stand, that cannot justify a specific prohibition in the constitution in the Bill of Rights.","start":754.705,"stop":778.198,"duration":23.49},{"text":"And, in fact, in Cole the whole base of the decision was that the statute clause is a specific prohibition, the first prohibition in the Bill of Rights against a financing of the operations of parochial schools.","start":778.198,"stop":795.336,"duration":17.14},{"text":"The state seems to, also indeed clearly bases its position on this, in this part that this statute is limited to schools in low-income areas.","start":795.336,"stop":814.993,"duration":19.66},{"text":"Again, I know of no decision of any Court holding that to be a critical, or relevant constitutional question, where the question is Equal Protection.","start":814.993,"stop":827.862,"duration":12.87},{"text":"If the state chooses a certain class as beneficiaries of its action and excludes other classes as for example, if the state provides free counsel in criminal case which indeed it must, to poor people but not to wealthy people or provide free access to the divorce cases, indeed it must for poor people not to wealthy people or other cases it does not provides the transcripts of criminal trial to put but not the wealthy people.","start":827.862,"stop":859.147,"duration":31.29}]},{"speakerName":"Potter

indigents.","start":861.039,"stop":864.992,"duration":3.95},{"text":"If the state -- then quite clearly this would not -- this is a rational classification not quite like the Equal Protection but the state could constitutionally provide free access with divorce courts, to faculty courts, to free transcripts, to public defense service, to all, to the indeed, it does in public schools.","start":864.992,"stop":892.76,"duration":27.77},{"text":"Public schools are open to everybody, the wealthiest as well as the most poor, and it is not a violation of Equal Protection because of the reasonable classification whether, if the state chooses one alternative free for all or the other type of free only for the poor, the indigent.","start":892.76,"stop":909.808,"duration":17.05},{"text":"But that never has been used to say that the state can violate an express provision of the Bill of Rights where individual who are involved where they cannot violate it, where the (Inaudible) to it.","start":909.808,"stop":927.731,"duration":17.92},{"text":"So, it seems to me that the first -- the unanimous decision of the court below is entirely correct, that it is a violation of the Establishment Clause for the state to provide funds for the maintenance and repair of schools which are used in part at least for religious education or religious question.","start":927.731,"stop":960.146,"duration":32.41},{"text":"The only case which can remotely justify this statute and very remotely, is the Everson case in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of paying, reimbursing parents for the expenses of sending their children on public bus to parochial schools.","start":960.146,"stop":991.01,"duration":30.86},{"text":"Mr. Justice Black for majority of the Court stated that the purpose of this law is to protect the children from the hazards of the road.","start":991.01,"stop":1006.087,"duration":15.08},{"text":"Well, we do not deny, we cannot deny because the of prior decision of this Court which seem to take a position that you cannot go behind what the legislative state in its declaration of purposes.","start":1006.087,"stop":1023.222,"duration":17.13},{"text":"Therefore we must assume that the purposes of this statute the same, but the effect is probably different, you do not teach religion or practice religion on the bus.","start":1023.222,"stop":1038.361,"duration":15.14},{"text":"If you did, if a private owned bus, in Everson it was a publicly owned bus, system parents got, paid back for the money which they paid for transportation of public bus but if you did under McCollum against Board of Education, going way back to 1948 which held that no premises publicly owned, publicly financed can be used for religious teaching or religious worship even for as much as a half an hour or an hour a week.","start":1038.361,"stop":1068.034,"duration":29.67},{"text":"If it does that, it is unconstitutional, that is what the Court held in McCollum and of course it held the same thing in Engel against Vitale, the prayer case, in Abington Township involving Bible reading and in Lemon against Kurtzman.","start":1068.034,"stop":1087.05,"duration":19.02},{"text":"So we believe that this part of the statute, part one, was quite properly held unconstitutional by unanimous vote of the District Court.","start":1087.05,"stop":1100.756,"duration":13.71},{"text":"Part two deals with tuition payments.","start":1100.756,"stop":1108.724,"duration":7.97},{"text":"The statute provides that up to 50 % of the tuition of the -- no, I believe it does have -- but the basic provision is that $50.00 is paid per child for the tuition up to no more than the tuition actually is -- for the tuition paid for enrollment in nonpublic schools.","start":1108.724,"stop":1151.513,"duration":42.79},{"text":"The question of tuition grants is not a new one, unlike the maintenance and repair and tax credits which are quite new which appear to be a recent.","start":1151.513,"stop":1165.98,"duration":14.47},{"text":"Tuition grants has a means of avoiding constitutional limitations goes back at least a century.","start":1165.98,"stop":1172.548,"duration":6.57},{"text":"It has been challenged in the Court in three different contexts.","start":1172.548,"stop":1178.446,"duration":5.9},{"text":"First, is a violation of state constitutional provisions against financing parochial schools.","start":1178.446,"stop":1185.83,"duration":7.38},{"text":"Second, under the Establishment clause of the First Amendment and third under the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in a racial segregation context, a decision growing out of state appropriations of public funds to pay for the tuition of pupils in racial segregated schools.","start":1185.83,"stop":1216.123,"duration":30.29},{"text":"Now, my own research and I am not volunteering that it is an exhaustive, indeed as I have indicated a moment, I did overlooked one case fortunately which would support to my position not oppose, but the research I have done has disclosed not a single decision and there were many, many which considered this question, not a single decision holding that there was a constitutional difference between a direct grant of public funds to religious schools and paying whole or part of the tuition of children attending those schools.","start":1216.123,"stop":1259.08,"duration":42.96},{"text":"The cases -- some of the cases there are many others, supporting my position are in my brief, both on the -- under the state constitutions Establishment Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.","start":1259.08,"stop":1279.494,"duration":20.41},{"text":"In the (Inaudible) cases decided both before and after the Lemon, DiCenso cases, there were three, I point out three in my brief, there is actually a fourth one, I must, I say overlooked things, I argued the case but it slipped my
