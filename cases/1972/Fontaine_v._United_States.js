Umin","textObjs":[{"text":"I’ll do my best, Your Honor.","start":66.466,"stop":68.402,"duration":1.94},{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":68.402,"stop":71.043,"duration":2.64},{"text":"This case here on writ of certiorari challenges the validity of a guilty plea, federal armed bank robbery, entered by the petitioner David X. Fontaine in Federal Court in November of 1969.","start":71.043,"stop":84.996,"duration":13.95},{"text":"The issues that the case raises were each presented pro se by Mr. Fontaine in his motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. 2255 and with the Court’s permission, I'll indulge in some oversimplification initially and define those issues as follows.","start":84.996,"stop":103.645,"duration":18.65},{"text":"First, whether 2255 entitled the petitioner to an evidentiary hearing upon his concrete allegations which he had threw -- which show that his guilty plea was coerced.","start":103.645,"stop":115.321,"duration":11.68},{"text":"And second and even more important, I would suggest, the threshold issue of whether petitioner’s guilty plea is void on the face of the existing record, without further evidentiary hearing, for want of a valid Sixth Amendment waiver of counsel.","start":115.321,"stop":131.701,"duration":16.38},{"text":"The procedural history of this case is the history of inattention to to detail.","start":131.701,"stop":136.016,"duration":4.31},{"text":"In the face of the petitioner’s concrete allegations, the police’s physical and mental abuse, United States Attorney declined even to answer those specific allegations.","start":136.016,"stop":146.118,"duration":10.1},{"text":"The District Court nonetheless denied the petitioner’s claims summarily without a hearing, his waiver of counsel points on the ground that the petitioner had participated in a Rule 11 proceeding at guilty plea and his voluntariness claim on the same ground.","start":146.118,"stop":165.606,"duration":19.49},{"text":"The Court of Appeals typical of the inattention paid to this case, affirmed the summary denial below in one sentence and that sentence contained an error, an error dealing with the ground of decision by the District Court.","start":165.606,"stop":179.957,"duration":14.35},{"text":"This Court granted certiorari and appointed counsel.","start":179.957,"stop":183.378,"duration":3.42},{"text":"I mentioned the appointment only to highlight that the absence of counsel at all prior stages of this case and most particularly at the guilty plea itself is the critical fact at hand.","start":183.378,"stop":194.553,"duration":11.18},{"text":"From arrest through custody, through plea and sentencing, the absence of counsel raises the federal issue whether this record, the existing record made at the guilty plea, discloses a waiver of counsel compatible with the Sixth Amendment standards.","start":194.553,"stop":213.505,"duration":18.95},{"text":"The issue must be framed precisely.","start":213.505,"stop":216.196,"duration":2.69},{"text":"This is not a question of whether at a guilty plea proceeding there was an offer of counsel and a rejection of counsel.","start":216.196,"stop":223.01,"duration":6.81},{"text":"We can argue about that.","start":223.01,"stop":224.331,"duration":1.32},{"text":"I do believe that the record shows something resembling an offer and something resembling a rejection.","start":224.331,"stop":229.957,"duration":5.63},{"text":"But the question is whether even if there was a meaningful offer of counsel and an offer of reject -- and a rejection of counsel, the circumstances of that offer and rejection disclose an understanding and intelligent waiver under the Sixth Amendment.","start":229.957,"stop":247.008,"duration":17.05},{"text":"To quote from Carnley against Cochran, “In the absence of an understanding of an intelligent waiver anything less is not waiver.”","start":247.008,"stop":256.19,"duration":9.18},{"text":"Let me say one word if I may about the position of that issue in this case.","start":256.19,"stop":260.302,"duration":4.11},{"text":"It stands as point number four in the petitioner’s brief on Page 47.","start":260.302,"stop":265.477,"duration":5.17},{"text":"In my judgment and I would respectfully submit it to the Court, it’s point number one in the case.","start":265.477,"stop":270.295,"duration":4.82},{"text":"So, I’m something in the position of a college debater that I once heard who perhaps over-tied to the structure of his own argument, had to begin by announcing to his audience that I have four points to make, let me make the fourth one first.","start":270.295,"stop":285.067,"duration":14.77},{"text":"The waiver of counsel point is indeed number four in the brief, but it’s number one the case.","start":285.067,"stop":289.259,"duration":4.19},{"text":"Let me turn to the facts that surround the waiver of counsel point, making two things clear at the outset.","start":289.259,"stop":296.216,"duration":6.96},{"text":"Absolutely nothing about that point depends upon the truth or falsity of the petitioner’s allegations pertaining to police abuse or coercion.","start":296.216,"stop":306.371,"duration":10.15},{"text":"Likewise, absolutely nothing about the waiver of counsel claim depends upon the Trial Court’s alleged compliance with the Rule 11 at the guilty plea proceeding.","start":306.371,"stop":318.749,"duration":12.38},{"text":"The waiver of counsel point depends entirely upon the record made at that proceeding for it’s the record which must disclose whether there was not merely an offer and rejection of counsel but an understanding, an intelligent one.","start":318.749,"stop":330.259,"duration":11.51},{"text":"It is the record to which Johnson against Zerbst, Carnley against Cochran and Boykin against Alabama refers.","start":330.259,"stop":338.109,"duration":7.85},{"text":"That record shows that the petitioner was arrested on October 21, 1969.","start":338.109,"stop":343.953,"duration":5.84},{"text":"That with the exception of a hospitalization he was in continuous custody.","start":343.953,"stop":347.989,"duration":4.04},{"text":"It is un-denied on the record that he was never arraigned at which time he might have been informed of his right to counsel.","start":347.989,"stop":354.781,"duration":6.79},{"text":"Even those facts are strictly speaking irrelevant.","start":354.781,"stop":358.63,"duration":3.85},{"text":"The first fact which is critical is that during his custody, he signed two pieces of paper, alleged waivers of grand jury indictment and counsel.","start":358.63,"stop":371.116,"duration":12.49},{"text":"And on November 13, he came to Court in the company of United States Attorney without a lawyer and the plea proceeding took place.","start":371.116,"stop":383.396,"duration":12.28},{"text":"I could read all of that proceeding to this Court in approximately four minutes at a reasonable pace.","start":383.396,"stop":389.893,"duration":6.5},{"text":"Doubling the time, let’s assume that plea proceeding took eight minutes in Federal Court.","start":389.893,"stop":396.178,"duration":6.29},{"text":"There is of course no time requirement on a guilty plea proceeding but I would submit that it is some index, the brevity of this proceeding is some index of the care and attention that was paid to the plea proceeding as a whole and to the question of the waiver of counsel, and I would read for you only that part of the proceeding which deals with the waiver of counsel, the very beginning of it and I’ll be very brief.","start":396.178,"stop":421.364,"duration":25.19},{"text":"The United States Attorney on page 3 of the appendix, Mr. Chief Justice, the Assistant United States Attorney, Mr. Zanglin (ph) begins, “Your Honor, this is an arraignment on an information charging the defendant with armed bank robbery.","start":421.364,"stop":434.319,"duration":12.96},{"text":"He’s been given a copy of the information.","start":434.319,"stop":436.69,"duration":2.37},{"text":"He acknowledges that he understands it and knows what the maximum penalty is.","start":436.69,"stop":440.781,"duration":4.09},{"text":"I have explained to him his right to an indictment by a grand jury.","start":440.781,"stop":443.849,"duration":3.07},{"text":"He has waived that right and signed a waiver of rights form.","start":443.849,"stop":447.164,"duration":3.31},{"text":"He understands that he has a right for an attorney at this time and informs me that he wants to waive that right and has signed the waiver of that right.","start":447.164,"stop":454.815,"duration":7.65},{"text":"Knowing all of these rights, he informs me he intends to plead guilty of the information.”","start":454.815,"stop":458.805,"duration":3.99},{"text":"The Court, “You are Mr. David Fontaine?”","start":458.805,"stop":461.94,"duration":3.13},{"text":"Defendant Fontaine, “Yes sir.”","start":461.94,"stop":464.367,"duration":2.43},{"text":"The Court, “Did you ever receive the copy of the information here, the charge against you for armed bank robbery, is that right?”","start":464.367,"stop":471.779,"duration":7.41},{"text":"Defendant Fontaine, “Right.”","start":471.779,"stop":474.232,"duration":2.45},{"text":"The Court, “The first thing of consequence is that you have signed also a waiver of grand jury indictment which means you are entitled to have this matter first submitted to a grand jury and a determination made by that body and an indictment returned first.”","start":474.232,"stop":488.663,"duration":14.43},{"text":"If the Court please, may I pause there to indicate that the trial court in accepting a plea first emphasizes the waiver of grand jury indictment out of court and then to the extent that it defines waiver at all defines it exactly erroneously.","start":488.663,"stop":504.721,"duration":16.06},{"text":"A waiver of a grand jury indictment does not mean that you are entitled to have this matter first submitted to as grand jury.","start":504.721,"stop":510.116,"duration":5.39},{"text":"It means exactly the opposite of that.","start":510.116,"stop":512.751,"duration":2.63},{"text":"The Court then continues, “Do you understand that the rights you have there under?","start":512.751,"stop":516.943,"duration":4.19},{"text":"Anyway, that’s what you will get if you wanted it to go to the grand jury.”","start":516.943,"stop":520.424,"duration":3.48}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E. Burger","textObjs":[{"text":"Don’t you think that cleared up whatever ambiguity troubled you about the first fact?","start":520.424,"stop":525.949,"duration":5.52}]},{"speakerName":"Steven M. Umin","textObjs":[{"text":"I think not, Your Honor because all the Court does is ask the defendant, do you understand that and the rights you have there under?","start":525.949,"stop":532.221,"duration":6.27},{"text":"If he understood that, that definition of waiver, he would be understanding precisely the opposite of what waiver was.","start":532.221,"stop":539.024,"duration":6.8},{"text":"Anyway, the Court says, “That’s what you will get if you wanted it to go to the grand jury.”","start":539.024,"stop":543.088,"duration":4.06},{"text":"Defendant Fontaine, “Yes.”","start":543.088,"stop":545.302,"duration":2.21},{"text":"The Court, “You have signed a waiver of that right, am I right?”","start":545.302,"stop":548.785,"duration":3.48},{"text":"Defendant Fontaine, “Yes, sir.”","start":548.785,"stop":550.793,"duration":2.01},{"text":"There’s no indication by the Court at that time that the defendant was free at that point to reconsider his waiver.","start":550.793,"stop":556.517,"duration":5.72},{"text":"So, the whole issue of waiver introduced by the Trial Court without any suggestion that prior waivers made out of Court and in custody can be reconsidered and then the Court addresses the critical counsel point.","start":556.517,"stop":569.031,"duration":12.51},{"text":"The Court, “In addition, you are entitled to be represented by an attorney And if you are without funds with which to employ an attorney, the Court will appoint one for you.","start":569.031,"stop":578.538,"duration":9.51},{"text":"The Court has here before it a waiver of an assignment of an attorney.","start":578.538,"stop":582.045,"duration":3.51},{"text":"Is it your wish to proceed here without an attorney?”","start":582.045,"stop":584.76,"duration":2.72},{"text":"Defendant Fontaine, “I guess so.”","start":584.76,"stop":587.818,"duration":3.06},{"text":"The Court, “You have got to know so.”","start":587.818,"stop":590.603,"duration":2.78},{"text":"Defendant Fontaine, “Yes sir.”","start":590.603,"stop":594.704,"duration":4.1},{"text":"I would submit to this Court that that part of the plea proceeding which is all there is, on the question of the waiver of counsel is deficient in multiple respects.","start":594.704,"stop":605.678,"duration":10.97},{"text":"First, there is no explanation at all in that part of the proceeding or anywhere else, as to what a guilty plea is, what rights it waives, and what right exists to plead not guilty.","start":605.678,"stop":618.507,"duration":12.83},{"text":"Under Boykin against Alabama, a State case, but decided under federal constitutional standards, that alone is sufficient to condemn the plea and force vacation of this conviction, but there’s more.","start":618.507,"stop":631.165,"duration":12.66},{"text":"The Court gave no explanation that a guilty plea does not entail the waiver of counsel.","start":631.165,"stop":636.124,"duration":4.96},{"text":"Indeed the opposite impression is left by the Court’s indication that you have got to know that you want to waive counsel.","start":636.124,"stop":643.121,"duration":7},{"text":"I don’t suggest that’s the only implication to come out of that sentence, but it’s a fairly likely one.","start":643.121,"stop":649.142,"duration":6.02},{"text":"And a layman is all too likely to consider a guilty plea as the equivalent of an abandonment of the lawyer.","start":649.142,"stop":655.929,"duration":6.79},{"text":"The lawyer is useful for the fight for the time of trial, but if you’re going to plead guilty, you certainly don’t need a lawyer.","start":655.929,"stop":662.161,"duration":6.23},{"text":"And I suggest, in order to correct that impression, to make sure that an understanding and intelligent waiver of counsel takes place is the obligation of the Court accepting a guilty plea to indicate when a waiver of counsel is possible, is tendered that a guilty plea does not entail a waiver, nor of course is there any explanation of the role of counsel to guilty plea, of his critical role in plea bargaining.","start":662.161,"stop":690.395,"duration":28.23},{"text":"This case does not indicate that any plea bargaining took place, indeed the sentence of 20 years with a maximum 25 suggest it didn’t.","start":690.395,"stop":699.647,"duration":9.25},{"text":"And there were also lesser included offenses to federal law in bank robbery, which were never mentioned by the Court and which could be very vital indeed in plea bargaining.","start":699.647,"stop":710.955,"duration":11.31},{"text":"The absence of any mention of lesser included offenses is, in my judgment, sufficient to condemn this plea under McCarthy against the United States where this Court did not quite hold that lesser included offenses had to be mentioned as part of the explanation to the defendant of the nature of the charge that was involved, but it strongly suggests in footnote 20 that where lesser included offenses are involved, the defendant cannot understand the nature of the charge without being told about it.","start":710.955,"stop":739.967,"duration":29.01},{"text":"Boykin and McCarthy thus far condemn the plea, but there’s still more.","start":739.967,"stop":745.78,"duration":5.81},{"text":"There is no statement by this Court that the Court thinks that counsel would be desirable.","start":745.78,"stop":750.869,"duration":5.09},{"text":"That a waiver of counsel is ordinarily not preferred.","start":750.869,"stop":755.112,"duration":4.24},{"text":"Indeed as this Court has put it on many, many occasions, every presumption is indulged against waiver.","start":755.112,"stop":760.271,"duration":5.16},{"text":"The system really has no interest in an un-counseled guilty plea although it has an interest guilty pleas generally.","start":760.271,"stop":768.047,"duration":7.78},{"text":"Nor when the petitioner indicated that he had guessed he did not want to proceed with a lawyer, did the Court take any concern or pains to clarify that ambiguous rejection to indicate at that point that he was offering a lawyer for this plea, to do anything at all to suggest to the defendant that this was not the time to guess about whether he wanted a lawyer or not.","start":768.047,"stop":793.21,"duration":25.16},{"text":"If you’re in any doubt at all, the Court advices you to

pistol.","start":3255.626,"stop":3256.672,"duration":1.05},{"text":"Yes, he held up the teller and he took the money and later at sentencing, he made the statement that he was under the influence of

points.","start":3371.624,"stop":3377.437,"duration":5.81},{"text":"First of all, petitioner was 26 years old.","start":3377.437,"stop":3381.297,"duration":3.86},{"text":"He had a seventh grade

petition at Page 11, he admits that he misspoke when he informed the Court that he didn’t have a record at the guilty plea hearing and admitted that he had a long record and also indicated the F -- he
