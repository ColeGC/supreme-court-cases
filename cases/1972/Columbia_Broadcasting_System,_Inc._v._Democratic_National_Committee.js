dissented.","start":504.346,"stop":511.269,"duration":6.92},{"text":"The Commission in its opinions did not really focus on advertising time except in response to Commissioner Johnson's dissent in the DNC case.","start":511.269,"stop":523.058,"duration":11.79},{"text":"And even there, the Commission appears to be talking about both programming and advertising time similarly in the BEM opinion.","start":523.058,"stop":533.402,"duration":10.34},{"text":"The Commission does not highlight advertising time though that was all that was involved in BEM's complain.","start":533.402,"stop":544.169,"duration":10.77},{"text":"Now, following these decisions, BEM and DNC filed separate appeals in the Court of Appeals.","start":544.169,"stop":552.782,"duration":8.61},{"text":"The Federal Communications Commission and the United States were the respondents.","start":552.782,"stop":558.891,"duration":6.11},{"text":"And the two cases were consolidated there, Post-Newsweek Stations, American Broadcasting Companies, and Columbia Broadcasting System intervened.","start":558.891,"stop":572.992,"duration":14.1},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the Commission in an opinion by Judge Wright concurred in by Judge Robinson

respondent.","start":601.91,"stop":612.386,"duration":10.48},{"text":"And the United States and the Federal Communications Commission filed petitions against both complainants, BEM and DNC.","start":612.386,"stop":624.606,"duration":12.22},{"text":"In many respects, the positions of the United States and the Commission on the one hand are similar to those of the broadcasters, on the other.","start":624.606,"stop":636.283,"duration":11.68},{"text":"In particular, speaking for the Commission and the United States, however, I should point out this possible difference.","start":636.283,"stop":644.659,"duration":8.38},{"text":"In particular, I am interested in maintaining the preposition that this is an area in which the Commission is properly concerned.","start":644.659,"stop":654.118,"duration":9.46},{"text":"And were it has authority to act, if it should determine that affirmative action on its part is appropriate.","start":654.118,"stop":662.968,"duration":8.85},{"text":"I should let the broadcaster speak for themselves, but they would, I gather from their briefs, preferred to have it establish that the Commission cannot act at all in this area consistently with their First Amendment rights.","start":662.968,"stop":678.649,"duration":15.68},{"text":"These differences does not seem to me to be essential in the present case, as long as it can be determined that the Commission acted properly when it decided not to act in these cases.","start":678.649,"stop":695.713,"duration":17.06},{"text":"Now, there's one more factual situation which I should put before the Court.","start":695.713,"stop":702.13,"duration":6.42},{"text":"While this case was pending before the Court of Appeals on June 19, 1971, the Commission published a notice in the Federal Register initiating a broad study into the efficacy of the Fairness Doctrine.","start":702.13,"stop":718.744,"duration":16.61},{"text":"The Commissions specifically under took the study, “In the light of current demands for access to the broadcast media to consider issues of public concern.”","start":718.744,"stop":732.781,"duration":14.04},{"text":"The Commission noted, however, that it could not abandon the Fairness Doctrine since that is ratified by Act of Congress or treat broadcasters as common carriers.","start":732.781,"stop":745.734,"duration":12.95},{"text":"What the Commission said -- sought it said, “Was whether the policies it had developed are the most effective means of fostering uninhibited robust wide open debate on public issues.”","start":745.734,"stop":763.563,"duration":17.83},{"text":"When, in January and February of this year there was a period when the mandate of the Court of Appeals in this case was not stayed, the Commission published a further notice soliciting comments on the procedures and guidelines necessary to carry out the mandate of the Court of Appeals.","start":763.563,"stop":785.331,"duration":21.77},{"text":"This letter notice was withdrawn.","start":785.331,"stop":788.312,"duration":2.98},{"text":"When this Court granted the certiorari and stayed the mandate of the Court of Appeals.","start":788.312,"stop":794.767,"duration":6.46},{"text":"But the Commission has continued its overall inquiry into the Fairness Doctrine and its operation, and has requested comments on what policies, if any, should be adopted with respect to access to the broadcast media.","start":794.767,"stop":811.497,"duration":16.73},{"text":"It has confined its inquiry to the non-constitutional aspects of access because the First Amendment issue was pending before this Court.","start":811.497,"stop":822.715,"duration":11.22},{"text":"It added that its final decision maybe delayed and made -- made in light of the Supreme Court's decision.","start":822.715,"stop":833.41,"duration":10.69},{"text":"I am advised that this inquiry is proceeding
