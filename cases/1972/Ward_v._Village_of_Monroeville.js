during which the mayor sought to shift the burden of going forward to the accused, a period that somewhat surprised and amazed the defense council would even challenge the credibility of a uniformed

council.","start":222.14,"stop":249.573,"duration":27.43},{"text":"And as a layman, not a lawyer relied rather substantially and heavily upon the prosecutor's legal

judge in these kinds of cases.","start":422.313,"stop":431.524,"duration":9.21},{"text":"The Ohio Revised Code Section 73715, 18, 73330 and 190520 made very clear his position as chief law enforcement officer in the village.","start":431.524,"stop":443.296,"duration":11.77},{"text":"In addition, it was developed and the law is also clear that the mayor is the chief executive of the village with
