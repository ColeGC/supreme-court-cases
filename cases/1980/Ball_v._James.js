electoral system of the Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District.","start":17.226,"stop":27.333,"duration":10.11},{"text":"Salt River Project is today, and it always has been, a federal water reclamation project.","start":27.333,"stop":34.254,"duration":6.92},{"text":"It's first owner and operator was the United States of America.","start":34.254,"stop":38.223,"duration":3.97},{"text":"The Salt River Valley Water Users Association, which is a private corporation organized under the laws of the Territory of Arizona, was formed in 1903 as the entity which could perform the statutory function of guaranteeing the repayment into the reclamation fund of the initial costs advanced by the United States.","start":38.223,"stop":58.653,"duration":20.43},{"text":"One of the obligations imposed on the Association by the United States in the initial 1904 contract between the two was the commitment that the only beneficiaries of the Project's water storage and development activities would be the landowners, who had subscribed their lands into... membership in the Association.","start":58.653,"stop":78.533,"duration":19.88},{"text":"And that obligation, imposed on the Association by the United States, is still in effect.","start":78.533,"stop":82.535,"duration":4},{"text":"So that from the beginning, the benefits of this Project have been proportionate to land ownership.","start":82.535,"stop":90.139,"duration":7.6},{"text":"In 1917, the role of the Association changed from guarantor to operator and for the next 20 years the care, operation, maintenance and control of the Project were vested in this private corporation.","start":90.139,"stop":103.281,"duration":13.14},{"text":"In 1937, the District was brought into being by the landowners of the Association as an agricultural improvement district, which under the laws of the state of Arizona, is a political subdivision of the state.","start":103.281,"stop":115.972,"duration":12.69},{"text":"Prior to the creation of the District, the Association and its members had experienced severe financial difficulties and the primary purpose of the District was to give the Project a better interest rate on its bonds by making that interest tax free.","start":115.972,"stop":131.382,"duration":15.41},{"text":"Over the decades, since 1937, the District has changed in several ways.","start":131.382,"stop":136.97,"duration":5.59},{"text":"And the most important of those changes, for present purposes, are two: the first is that though the physical boundaries of this District and Association have remained the same, the number of people living in those boundaries has increased so that the number of landowners entitled to use the water stored and developed by the Project, as well as the number of electric customers, has increased.","start":136.97,"stop":164.637,"duration":27.67},{"text":"And the second change is reflected in a pair of statutory amendments in 1969 and 1974, through which the Arizona legislature has significantly increased the extent of small landowner influence in the election to board of directors.","start":164.637,"stop":182.582,"duration":17.94},{"text":"The 1969 change eliminated the formerly existing one acre limitation as a condition for the franchise, and the 1974 change expanded the board from 10 to 14 with the further provision that those four additional members of the board of directors would be elected at large, on a one landowner/one vote basis.","start":182.582,"stop":206.164,"duration":23.58},{"text":"But even more important than how the District has changed is how it has not changed.","start":206.164,"stop":210.732,"duration":4.57},{"text":"It still serves raw water to the same lands, the number of persons benefitted has changed but its purpose and function have not.","start":210.732,"stop":222.874,"duration":12.14},{"text":"The Arizona Supreme Court has held and the parties to this case have stipulated that the primary purpose of the Salt River Project is today and always has been, the storage, development and delivery of raw water for the benefit of those landowners who were willing to risk their property in order to bring it into existence.","start":222.874,"stop":241.185,"duration":18.31},{"text":"Now the Appellees take a different view of the significance of these changes in the number of people served by the Project.","start":241.185,"stop":250.541,"duration":9.36},{"text":"They contend that the significance of this increase in population is that the District has effectively been converted into the equivalent of a city.","start":250.541,"stop":260.813,"duration":10.27},{"text":"And they refer, for example, to the District's city like status and have asserted that it has all the attributes of sovereignty.","start":260.813,"stop":269.753,"duration":8.94},{"text":"Two comments with respect to this view are appropriate.","start":269.753,"stop":272.87,"duration":3.12},{"text":"The first is that this view is absolutely essential to their position.","start":272.87,"stop":278.172,"duration":5.3},{"text":"The second is that it is squarely inconsistent with controlling holdings of the Arizona Supreme Court.","start":278.172,"stop":285.178,"duration":7.01},{"text":"Because the Arizona Supreme Court has ruled, and I'm quoting,","start":285.178,"stop":288.463,"duration":3.29},{"text":"\"that the District's function is purely business and economic and not political and governmental, and that it's limited governmental attributes have been conferred for the purpose of better enabling it to function and accomplish the business and economic purpose for which it was organized.

governmental functions that any entity might have, the issue is how many are enjoyed by this creature of Arizona law, this Agricultural Improvement District.","start":307.792,"stop":328.957,"duration":21.17},{"text":"And the answer has been supplied by the Arizona Supreme Court; only those incidents of public ness, of governmentalness, that are absolutely essential in order to enable the District to perform its proprietary business economic activities.","start":328.957,"stop":345.517,"duration":16.56},{"text":"What this case really involves is state encouragement of private investment in water reclamation.","start":345.517,"stop":354.539,"duration":9.02},{"text":"Which, I submit, is a most appropriate endeavor for an arid state like Arizona.","start":354.539,"stop":360.176,"duration":5.64},{"text":"But it's our position that there's nothing in the United States Constitution that says that Arizona can't do that.","start":360.176,"stop":366.963,"duration":6.79},{"text":"And we also believe that that is the thrust of this Court's decision in Salyer v.
