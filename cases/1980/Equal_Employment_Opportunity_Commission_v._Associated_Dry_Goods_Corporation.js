Sullivan","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":61.805,"stop":65.108,"duration":3.3},{"text":"This case is here on on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.","start":65.108,"stop":71.679,"duration":6.57},{"text":"The question presented is a narrow but important question of statutory construction regarding Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.","start":71.679,"stop":82.052,"duration":10.37},{"text":"The question is whether Section 706(b) and 709(e) of Title VII which prohibit the Commission from disclosing investigatory information to the public prior to the filing of a suit prohibit disclosures of such information to persons immediately involved in Commission proceedings.","start":82.052,"stop":108.102,"duration":26.05},{"text":"This is a narrow question in two senses.","start":108.102,"stop":112.506,"duration":4.4},{"text":"First, the textual question is a narrow one, whether the words of the statute, \"making public\", includes persons who are immediately involved in administrative proceedings.","start":112.506,"stop":128.099,"duration":15.59},{"text":"Secondly, in context, in Section 709(e) of the statute, it is clear that the prohibition on making public this information applies only to prelitigation disclosure, to disclosures that are made prior to the time that the Title VII action is brought.","start":128.099,"stop":155.083,"duration":26.98},{"text":"Therefore, the question is not whether disclosures of information may occur, even to the public, but the timing of those disclosures.","start":155.083,"stop":167.324,"duration":12.24},{"text":"The question is an important question for purposes of the administration of Title VII, because the answer to the question, whether the charging parties and attorneys and respondents and material witnesses are members of the public within the meaning of the statute will impact on the Commission's administration of the statute in investigation, conciliation, and reasonable cause determination, virtually at every stage of the Commission's processing of charges of employment discrimination.","start":167.324,"stop":208.051,"duration":40.73},{"text":"The facts of this case may be briefly stated.","start":208.051,"stop":212.337,"duration":4.29},{"text":"In November, 1971, and continuing through June, 1973, seven charges of employment discrimination were filed with the Commission against the Joseph Horne Company, a Pittsburgh retailer, and the subsidiary of respondent, Associated Dry Goods.","start":212.337,"stop":239.106,"duration":26.77},{"text":"These charges alleged discrimination... these charges were filed by seven women.","start":239.106,"stop":246.76,"duration":7.65},{"text":"In six of the cases sex discrimination was charged.","start":246.76,"stop":252.847,"duration":6.09},{"text":"In the seventh charge, which was also filed by a woman, racial discrimination was charged.","start":252.847,"stop":261.12,"duration":8.27},{"text":"Three of the charges also charged retaliation.","start":261.12,"stop":266.922,"duration":5.8},{"text":"In February, 1974, the Commission began its investigation by asking the Joseph Horne Company to produce certain evidence that the Commission thought relevant to these charges.","start":266.922,"stop":283.8,"duration":16.88},{"text":"Basically, the evidence that was requested was information pertaining to the Company's personnel practices and employment files and other information relating to the departments of the employer in which these seven charging parties were employed.","start":283.8,"stop":304.547,"duration":20.75},{"text":"Horne declined the Commission's request for this information on the ground that the Commission would not guarantee at that point that information thus collected would not be disclosed to charging parties or their attorneys or to witnesses during the course of the proceedings.","start":304.547,"stop":330.697,"duration":26.15},{"text":"Thereafter, negotiations followed.","start":330.697,"stop":336.518,"duration":5.82},{"text":"They were eventually unsuccessful.","start":336.518,"stop":339.386,"duration":2.87},{"text":"The Commission in October, 1974, issued an administrative subpoena for purposes of acquiring much the same information.","start":339.386,"stop":349.678,"duration":10.29},{"text":"In June, 1975, Associated brought this action in the Eastern District of Virginia, asserting that the Commission's disclosure policies violated Sections 706(b) and 709(e).","start":349.678,"stop":365.77,"duration":16.09},{"text":"Subsequently the Commission brought an action itself to enforce its subpoena in the Western District of Pennsylvania.","start":365.77,"stop":375.476,"duration":9.71},{"text":"The two suits were subsequently consolidated in the Eastern District of Virginia; the District Court enforced subpoena, but held that disclosure to the parties and to attorneys would do violence to the statutory scheme because it would affect conciliation and settlement, and therefore held that the parties were included within the public for purposes of this statute.","start":375.476,"stop":404.662,"duration":29.19},{"text":"In October, 1979, the Court of Appeals affirmed by divided vote.","start":404.662,"stop":413.684,"duration":9.02},{"text":"The question the Court of Appeals determined was whether disclosure to charging parties and attorneys prior to suit violates Section 706(b) and 709(e).","start":413.684,"stop":426.511,"duration":12.83},{"text":"The Court held that it did.","start":426.511,"stop":429.63,"duration":3.12},{"text":"Judge Hall dissented in the Court of Appeals.","start":429.63,"stop":434.932,"duration":5.3}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"The Court primarily held it violated 709(e), didn't it?","start":434.932,"stop":436.95,"duration":2.02}]},{"speakerName":"Barry Sullivan","textObjs":[{"text":"I believe, Mr. Justice--","start":436.95,"stop":440.586,"duration":3.64}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"That's certainly the statutory provision upon which respondent primarily relies.","start":440.586,"stop":444.389,"duration":3.8}]},{"speakerName":"Barry Sullivan","textObjs":[{"text":"--That is correct.","start":444.389,"stop":445.472,"duration":1.08}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"So that you don't really accurately state the question, that the question is a 709(e) question, not a 706(b) and 709(e) question.","start":445.472,"stop":454.078,"duration":8.61}]},{"speakerName":"Barry Sullivan","textObjs":[{"text":"I recognize that is what Respondent asserts, Mr. Justice.","start":454.078,"stop":457.197,"duration":3.12},{"text":"However, the text of the opinion of the Court of Appeals is quite clear in relying on both of the sections.","start":457.197,"stop":465.219,"duration":8.02}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R. White","textObjs":[{"text":"So if it was right on either one, we could affirm?","start":465.219,"stop":470.957,"duration":5.74}]},{"speakerName":"Barry Sullivan","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that would be correct although I don't think that the 4th Circuit was correct on either one.","start":470.957,"stop":478.877,"duration":7.92}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"You're talking about Judge Winters' opinion?","start":478.877,"stop":480.579,"duration":1.7}]},{"speakerName":"Barry Sullivan","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, Your Honor.","start":480.579,"stop":481.696,"duration":1.12},{"text":"Judge Hall dissented noting that the decision of the majority was not based on statutory construction, but was based on policy ground, namely, the fear that disclosure to charging parties and their attorneys would contribute to litigation.","start":481.696,"stop":505.428,"duration":23.73},{"text":"The Judge also noted that the practical effect of the decision was to require charging parties to file lawsuits in order to determine whether their charges had any merit, and that the practical effect was simply to delay disclosure to the parties, not to deny disclosure.","start":505.428,"stop":531.911,"duration":26.48},{"text":"I should also note, however, that in one respect Judge Hall did not agree with the Commission in that Judge Hall believed that disclosure of materials in related case files which the Commission believes is appropriate was not valid.","start":531.911,"stop":557.146,"duration":25.24},{"text":"The decision of the 4th Circuit simply does not come to grips with the problem that's presented in this case.","start":557.146,"stop":573.822,"duration":16.68},{"text":"The Court of Appeals held that charging parties and attorneys were members of the public, but at the same time the Court found that certain disclosures could be made to the parties during the administrative process.","start":573.822,"stop":593.252,"duration":19.43},{"text":"The Court of Appeals said that information could not be disseminated to the parties in haec verba but that the Commission could say to the parties, it has been reported that, or it has been said that, and then effectively convey the information that was contained in the file.","start":593.252,"stop":618.117,"duration":24.87},{"text":"We believe that does not come to grips with the problem that's presented in this case because Section 709(e) prevents disclosure to the public in any manner whatever.","start":618.117,"stop":632.294,"duration":14.18},{"text":"The solution of the 4th Circuit, while it may be an appropriate solution in some respects, is not a solution to the problem of statutory construction that's presented in this case.","start":632.294,"stop":651.19,"duration":18.9},{"text":"The real question that has to be decided with respect to Section 709(e) and with respect to Section 706(b) is whether the phrase, \"making public\" is meant to include persons who are directly involved in the administrative proceedings.","start":651.19,"stop":674.64,"duration":23.45},{"text":"Moreover, we submit that the 4th Circuit's construction of the statute, the definition of \"making public\" which was accepted by the courts below, is erroneous in any event.","start":674.64,"stop":693.684,"duration":19.04},{"text":"Although 706(b) and 709(e) are read together as they must be, and in light of legislative history, that the prohibition of public disclosure means the prohibition of disclosing information to the general public.","start":693.684,"stop":722.704,"duration":29.02},{"text":"As Senator Humphrey said in the legislative debates, this is a ban on publicizing.","start":722.704,"stop":729.958,"duration":7.25},{"text":"However, the meaning of the statute is even more clear when these provisions are read against the statute as a whole.","start":729.958,"stop":741.332,"duration":11.37},{"text":"The Commission has the duty to investigate and to determine reasonable cause, and to attempt to settle disputes through informal means of conciliation, conference, and persuasion.","start":741.332,"stop":756.442,"duration":15.11},{"text":"It would be impossible for the Commission to successfully and effectively undertake and complete these statutory duties if they could not disclose material to charging parties and to material witnesses when necessary.","start":756.442,"stop":777.005,"duration":20.56},{"text":"It is particularly obvious in the investigation stage when the Commission is presented with a charge of discrimination which it must attempt to investigate in order to determine whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a violation of the statute occurred.","start":777.005,"stop":801.989,"duration":24.98},{"text":"The respondent here asserts that nondisclosure to the parties would forward the investigation because respondents or employers would be more likely to come forward with information.","start":801.989,"stop":823.319,"duration":21.33},{"text":"While that may be true, two points must be made: the Commission has compulsory process and can enforce its subpoenas in court, so essentially the respondent is saying that employers will come forward with the information that they're required by statutes to come forward with in any event.","start":823.319,"stop":849.054,"duration":25.74},{"text":"Secondly, even if the information were produced by employers more freely, the difficulty is that all of the information that they might provide simply would not advance the investigation if that material could not be tested during the investigation.","start":849.054,"stop":875.787,"duration":26.73},{"text":"The investigation requires more than the receipt of one-sided information.","start":875.787,"stop":882.625,"duration":6.84},{"text":"It requires the Commission to go out and try to verify that information and determine its truth.","start":882.625,"stop":891.064,"duration":8.44},{"text":"With respect to the reasonable cause determination the same principles apply.","start":891.064,"stop":898.534,"duration":7.47},{"text":"The quality of that determination can be no greater than the quality of the investigations which led to it.","start":898.534,"stop":907.073,"duration":8.54}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A.

relief.","start":1008.124,"stop":1011.76,"duration":3.64},{"text":"Is the Commission authorized to assist litigants in their quest for relief?","start":1011.76,"stop":1015.611,"duration":3.85}]},{"speakerName":"Barry Sullivan","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't believe that... that question is not easy to answer, Mr.

individuals.","start":1023.983,"stop":1031.673,"duration":7.69},{"text":"That authorization occurs in Section 2000(e)(4)(g) of the enumeration of the Commission's powers.","start":1031.673,"stop":1046.833,"duration":15.16},{"text":"However, I wouldn't rely on that exclusively.","start":1046.833,"stop":1050.785,"duration":3.95},{"text":"As you are aware, the Commission has the right to bring a civil complaint itself in meritorious cases.","start":1050.785,"stop":1063.842,"duration":13.06},{"text":"And if the Commission had sufficient resources it could obviously bring a civil action in every case that was brought before it in which the charging parties' charge was deemed to have sufficient merit to go forward.","start":1063.842,"stop":1084.791,"duration":20.95},{"text":"However, it can't do that because it doesn't have the administrative resources to do it, and therefore the Commission's enforcement of Title VII depends in large part on private actions being brought.","start":1084.791,"stop":1103.352,"duration":18.56},{"text":"If an action were being brought by the Commission itself in a Title VII case, clearly the investigative files that were in its possession would be things that the Commission could use in framing the complaint.","start":1103.352,"stop":1126.201,"duration":22.85},{"text":"And if the charging party is acting effectively as a private attorney general, I think that it's implicit in the statutory

it's important to understand that there are really two kinds of disclosures that go on during the course of the administrative process.","start":1190.658,"stop":1200.749,"duration":10.09},{"text":"One is the kind of disclosure that goes on during conciliation or investigation, and those are by and large limited disclosures in which the Commission is trying to investigate and conciliate the charge, and in effect is filtering the information to the parties as it deems necessary to forward those goals.","start":1200.749,"stop":1224.281,"duration":23.53},{"text":"However, the Commission also gives the charging party in effect a last clear chance in prelitigation disclosure to see what's in the case file in order to make a determined and reasoned decision as to whether to go forward with the case.","start":1224.281,"stop":1244.195,"duration":19.91},{"text":"And when the attorney who's representing the charging party at that point is able to make that determination, the Commission believes that the overall purposes of Title VII are well served, because the attorney is more likely to persuade the charging party at that point that a meritorious case isn't worth bringing, and also that a meritorious case is worth bringing.","start":1244.195,"stop":1272.012,"duration":27.82}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Of course, for the former alternative, I suppose the
