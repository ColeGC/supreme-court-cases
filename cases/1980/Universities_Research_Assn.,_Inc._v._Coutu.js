Mann","textObjs":[{"text":"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":50.34,"stop":53.791,"duration":3.45},{"text":"The issue before the Court in this case is whether under the Davis-Bacon Act a federal court would have jurisdiction to revise a public contract upon suit by a private party against a private contractor without regard to the actions or inactions of the agency party to the contract.","start":53.791,"stop":76.658,"duration":22.87},{"text":"The case arises at the Fermi National Accelerator Lab near Batavia, Illinois, which is a high energy physics research establishment housing the world's largest proton accelerator.","start":76.658,"stop":88.403,"duration":11.75},{"text":"The petitioner is an association of universities which has entered into a contract with the Federal Government, originally through the Atomic Energy Commission, and more recently with the Department of Energy, to manage the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.","start":88.403,"stop":104.099,"duration":15.7},{"text":"All funds for the construction and management of the Laboratory are supplied by the Federal Government through provisions in the contract.","start":104.099,"stop":114.751,"duration":10.65},{"text":"The petitioner's role is that of manager, to supervise construction, to supervise the operation, and to supervise the maintenance of the facility.","start":114.751,"stop":123.935,"duration":9.18},{"text":"To carry out its responsibilities, the petitioner association is authorized by the Government to hire individuals to work in various categories, such as physicist, engineer, technician, clerical person, et cetera, and all funds for the compensation of those persons are provided by the Federal Government in accordance with the contract.","start":123.935,"stop":145.612,"duration":21.68},{"text":"There are rate schedules attached to the contract which have been agreed to by the Government as appropriate for payment of the individuals employed by the petitioner.","start":145.612,"stop":156.296,"duration":10.68},{"text":"The claimant in this case maintains that notwithstanding his employment as an electronics technician, that is, one assigned to monitor computers, operate accelerators, and assist in research functions, he should have been paid at area electrician construction rates pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act.","start":156.296,"stop":175.178,"duration":18.88},{"text":"The contract specifically provides that the parties did not contemplate performance of construction work by persons employed by the Association, and therefore there are no Davis-Bacon Act stipulations in the contract.","start":175.178,"stop":191.141,"duration":15.96},{"text":"The Federal District Court issued two rulings.","start":191.141,"stop":195.234,"duration":4.09},{"text":"The first ruling held that in the absence of an express Davis-Bacon Act provision in the contract there could be no right of recovery.","start":195.234,"stop":202.949,"duration":7.72},{"text":"The case was left open for purposes of allowing the plaintiff to show if he could that the Government had made separate determinations regarding his work as being construction in nature.","start":202.949,"stop":214.959,"duration":12.01},{"text":"After the taking of a number of depositions, other discovery, Freedom of Information Act requests, the plaintiff was forced to conclude that he could show no prior agency determination that his work was in fact covered by the Davis-Bacon Act.","start":214.959,"stop":231.5,"duration":16.54},{"text":"Consequently, the Federal District Court granted a motion for summary judgment upon that result.","start":231.5,"stop":237.342,"duration":5.84},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed.","start":237.342,"stop":239.81,"duration":2.47},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, in effect, held that regardless of the express inclusion of Davis-Bacon Act provisions in this contract, they were included as a matter of law and that the Federal District Court would have authority in effect to substitute its judgment for that of the agency regarding the construction nature of the plaintiff's work, to set an appropriate wage scale, and to set up an appropriate classification.","start":239.81,"stop":266.86,"duration":27.05},{"text":"In doing so it extrapolated from its 1977 McDaniel case in which it held that there was an implied right of action to enforce express contract terms setting forth Davis-Bacon Act requirements.","start":266.86,"stop":281.479,"duration":14.62},{"text":"We would ask the Court to focus on the fact that this is not a proceeding arising under the Administrative Procedure Act challenging agency action.","start":281.479,"stop":291.444,"duration":9.97},{"text":"It is not a proceeding arising under a contract action based upon express contract commitments.","start":291.444,"stop":298.16,"duration":6.72},{"text":"Our petitioner here has never entered into a contract agreeing to pay Davis-Bacon Act rates.","start":298.16,"stop":303.486,"duration":5.33},{"text":"It is not an action to enforce a self-enforcing statute, such as an equal opportunity clause, which is directed to the beneficiary party without regard to Government actions.","start":303.486,"stop":317.496,"duration":14.01},{"text":"This is an action which attempts to maintain a private cause of action to secure a judicial determination as to coverage of the Davis-Bacon Act, application of particular wages and classifications.","start":317.496,"stop":331.287,"duration":13.79},{"text":"The effect is to substitute the federal courts for the agencies' contracting officers regarding these matters of coverage, classification, and rates.","start":331.287,"stop":341.814,"duration":10.53},{"text":"Not only that, the action is brought against a not-for-profit entity which does not stand to gain or lose, depending on what rates are paid to the employees.","start":341.814,"stop":352.763,"duration":10.95},{"text":"And it is brought after the contract has already been performed.","start":352.763,"stop":357.824,"duration":5.06},{"text":"It is not being brought in anticipation of the contract, as some recent cases have been brought, but after the contract was performed the Federal District Court was asked to revise the contract to include specific Davis-Bacon Act provisions and to hold the defendant not-for-profit contractor liable without regard to the agency action that it had contracted with.","start":357.824,"stop":380.923,"duration":23.1},{"text":"As the Court undoubtedly knows, the Davis-Bacon Act emerged along with other pieces of legislation in the same legislative era of the '30s, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Walsh-Healey Act, and of course the Davis-Bacon Act and other provisions requiring the payment of wages at certain levels in order to rectify conditions that had resulted from the Depression.","start":380.923,"stop":404.821,"duration":23.9},{"text":"There are significant differences, however, between the Davis Bacon-Act and the Walsh-Healey Act, on the one hand, and the Fair Labor Standards Act on the other.","start":404.821,"stop":414.645,"duration":9.82},{"text":"The same Congress that enacted these statutes provided that the Davis-Bacon Act and Walsh-Healey Act policies would be enforced through the vehicle of contract, and not only through the vehicle of contract but through the vehicle of administrative pre-determination of what the obligations would be.","start":414.645,"stop":433.138,"duration":18.49},{"text":"Conversely, in the Fair Labor Standards Act the universal minimum wage and hours of work standard was set and the parties affected by that were expressly given the right to file suit to enforce their rights independently of the Government to secure their wages.","start":433.138,"stop":451.834,"duration":18.7},{"text":"Congress was concerned about the social goal that it had, that is, to make sure that local wage and labor markets were not disrupted, but also was concerned about maintaining efficiency in government contracting.","start":451.834,"stop":467.281,"duration":15.45},{"text":"And so it struck a balance.","start":467.281,"stop":468.469,"duration":1.19},{"text":"It struck a balance in the Davis-Bacon Act, and the fulcrum of that balance is the concept of predetermination, so that before the contract is gone into and executed, all parties know what their obligations are and no one can be heard to complain if the obligations prove too onerous.","start":468.469,"stop":486.352,"duration":17.88},{"text":"What we have here is an attempt by the Court of Appeals and the respondents to upset that fulcrum, to establish a principle whereby the federal courts after the contract has been executed, notwithstanding the predetermination concept, are in a position to go back and determine that something should have been paid at a different rate than it was.","start":486.352,"stop":507.61,"duration":21.26},{"text":"The concept of predetermination, which is embedded in the Davis-Bacon Act, was a topic of the legislative amendments to that Act in 1935.","start":507.61,"stop":517.51,"duration":9.9},{"text":"Prior to 1935 there was no provision for predetermination.","start":517.51,"stop":521.509,"duration":4},{"text":"In 1935, after a four-year history of some confusion in applying the law, Congress expressly amended it to provide for predetermination, so that the contract would carry the obligations and not some implied obligations based upon a post-analysis of the work.","start":521.509,"stop":539.768,"duration":18.26}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Mann, could I just be sure I understand your position.","start":539.768,"stop":543.048,"duration":3.28},{"text":"Assume here there had been a predetermination that some part of the construction work on the laboratory would be covered by Davis-Bacon.","start":543.048,"stop":551.092,"duration":8.04},{"text":"And the laboratory did not pay those... and it was performed by their own people.","start":551.092,"stop":555.651,"duration":4.56},{"text":"And supposing an employee didn't know about that till the contract was performed and then he had gotten less than the Davis-Bacon Act provided, would he have in your view of the law, have a private cause of action against your client for the difference between what he was paid and what he actually should have been paid?","start":555.651,"stop":573.363,"duration":17.71}]},{"speakerName":"Robert E. Mann","textObjs":[{"text":"We have taken the position on that question, Mr. Justice Stevens, that there is under the Act no private right of action at all, even to recover under express provisions.","start":573.363,"stop":586.717,"duration":13.35},{"text":"There may be a right of action in a state court, under a state common law theory of third-party beneficiary, but not in federal court, because there's no real federal question there; it's a contract question involved there.","start":586.717,"stop":597.978,"duration":11.26},{"text":"So we've taken the position that even if there were an express contract that there would not be a private right to go to court.","start":597.978,"stop":603.366,"duration":5.39}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Did you take that position in the 7th Circuit?","start":603.366,"stop":604.522,"duration":1.16}]},{"speakerName":"Robert E. Mann","textObjs":[{"text":"The position of the 7th Circuit... that question was not asked in the 7th Circuit, and that issue was not actually before us.","start":604.522,"stop":613.644,"duration":9.12}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"But you didn't raise that in the 7th Circuit?","start":613.644,"stop":615.69,"duration":2.05}]},{"speakerName":"Robert E.
