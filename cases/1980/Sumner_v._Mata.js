several hundred pictures shown to him.","start":210.54,"stop":229.689,"duration":19.15},{"text":"The other witnesses were inmates by the name of Rigoberto Almengor and Jay

minutes.","start":249.024,"stop":257.443,"duration":8.42},{"text":"Almengor testified that at one point during it he struggled briefly with the defendant.","start":257.443,"stop":263.628,"duration":6.19},{"text":"He made eye contact with the defendant, the defendant broke off his attack on the victim and commenced an attack on Mr.

off.","start":273.765,"stop":292.226,"duration":18.46},{"text":"They faced each other from a short distance, and at this point Almengor indicated that he wanted no part of this struggle that was going

institution.","start":314.685,"stop":324.791,"duration":10.11},{"text":"From these he was able to narrow it down to a group of four of them which he said were similar in appearance to the men he had

positive.","start":335.723,"stop":341.986,"duration":6.26},{"text":"In fact, he selected more pictures at the time than he said there were assailants.","start":341.986,"stop":347.937,"duration":5.95},{"text":"Mr. Allen was also interviewed this day.","start":347.937,"stop":350.608,"duration":2.67},{"text":"He stated that he did not want to get involved and for this reason he told the prison authorities he was able to identify no one.","start":350.608,"stop":358.48,"duration":7.87},{"text":"Because of this they showed him no pictures.","start":358.48,"stop":361.697,"duration":3.22},{"text":"In the next few days after this there is evidence in the record that a riot was occurring at the prison and that the investigation

witnesses were shown a group of 24 pictures of inmates.","start":373.709,"stop":385.456,"duration":11.75},{"text":"This was People's Exhibit 23, introduced at trial, and it as well as People's Exhibit 24, which I'll mention in a moment, has been brought before this Court.","start":385.456,"stop":396.106,"duration":10.65},{"text":"Mr. Childress was able to identify all three of the defendants from

only.","start":404.056,"stop":409.305,"duration":5.25},{"text":"Again his identification was not positive.","start":409.305,"stop":413.506,"duration":4.2},{"text":"He stated that the pictures that he was looking at seemed to him to be outdated and he asked the prison authorities to see what they could do about getting some new pictures for him to view.","start":413.506,"stop":424.188,"duration":10.68},{"text":"Mr. Allen saw the same group of pictures that day.","start":424.188,"stop":427.719,"duration":3.53},{"text":"He was able to identify no one.","start":427.719,"stop":429.859,"duration":2.14},{"text":"He too commented that he thought new pictures would be helpful.","start":429.859,"stop":434.951,"duration":5.09},{"text":"In a few days following this the prison authorities attempted to take new pictures of a number of inmates.","start":434.951,"stop":442.384,"duration":7.43},{"text":"Only those of the three defendants turned out.","start":442.384,"stop":443.712,"duration":1.33},{"text":"These three pictures were placed in a different group of 15 pictures, which is People's Exhibit 24, which were shown to the witnesses on the 30th of October.","start":443.712,"stop":455.88,"duration":12.17},{"text":"The identifying information on these pictures, the names and the dates the pictures were taken, that was covered at the time.","start":455.88,"stop":463.234,"duration":7.35},{"text":"At this point both Allen and Almengor identified all three of the defendants.","start":463.234,"stop":470.25,"duration":7.02},{"text":"At trial the two of them stated that they were now sure when they saw Mr. Vargas in person at trial that he was not one of the people who attacked the victim.","start":470.25,"stop":480.402,"duration":10.15},{"text":"They remained firm, however, in their identifications of the defendant and Mr. Gallegos.","start":480.402,"stop":486.492,"duration":6.09},{"text":"I believe that the 9th Circuit's opinion is in error in several respects.","start":486.492,"stop":493.6,"duration":7.11},{"text":"The first error is its statement of the standard for determining the admissibility of identification evidence in a case where pretrial photographic identification procedures have been used.","start":493.6,"stop":508.188,"duration":14.59},{"text":"The 9th Circuit stated that the appropriate standard required a two-part approach.","start":508.188,"stop":517.372,"duration":9.18},{"text":"First, a court should look to the necessity for use of photographic identification procedures.","start":517.372,"stop":522.978,"duration":5.61},{"text":"Here, since the defendant and his codefendants were state prison inmates, the court found that there was no necessity for the use of photographic identification procedures.","start":522.978,"stop":534.552,"duration":11.57},{"text":"From this lack of necessity it proceeded directly to a determination of whether there had been a likelihood of misidentification.","start":534.552,"stop":543.689,"duration":9.14},{"text":"The lack of necessity was said to be an important factor weighing against the admissibility of their identification evidence.","start":543.689,"stop":551.779,"duration":8.09},{"text":"It is our position and our belief that this Court has never held that necessity or lack of necessity for use of a particular procedure is part of the constitutional standard.","start":551.779,"stop":565.663,"duration":13.88},{"text":"Indeed, the Court has rejected attempts, most recently, in Manson v. Brathwaite, to have generalities such as this included in what is basically a fact-oriented balancing process.","start":565.663,"stop":578.675,"duration":13.01},{"text":"The Court has, in Simmons v. United States, and again in U.S. v. Ash, declined the opportunity to formulate special rules in cases where pretrial photographic identification procedures have been used.","start":578.675,"stop":595.59,"duration":16.92},{"text":"The Court has, instead, applied what we believe is a consistent standard of due process fairness in all cases involving the use of pretrial identification procedures.","start":595.59,"stop":610.005,"duration":14.41},{"text":"It has applied the same standard whether photographic identification procedures were used, whether a live lineup or showup was used, or whether there was a combination of these factors.","start":610.005,"stop":622.266,"duration":12.26},{"text":"I believe that this Court's due process standard focuses on two things: first, the suggested nature of the particular pretrial confrontation involved in the case; and, second, the reliability of the identification evidence.","start":622.266,"stop":639.042,"duration":16.78},{"text":"We believe that the Court's consistent treatment of all these situations makes it clear that it believes that due process does not require that a particular procedure be used, or that the use of one procedure as opposed to another should be penalized.","start":639.042,"stop":656.315,"duration":17.27},{"text":"Rather, I believe the Court's cases require only that the procedure which is actually used not be so unfair to deny a defendant due process.","start":656.315,"stop":666.389,"duration":10.07},{"text":"We therefore ask the Court to reject the 9th Circuit's approach and to affirm the approach which has been adopted by the 5th Circuit and by the majority of the other courts which have considered the issue.","start":666.389,"stop":679.463,"duration":13.07},{"text":"And that approach, very briefly stated, is as follows.","start":679.463,"stop":684.522,"duration":5.06},{"text":"First, if the defendant objects to the admission of identification evidence, a court should first ask itself whether the pretrial identification procedures actually used have been so impermissibly suggestive that they could give rise to a very substantial likelihood of mistaken identification.","start":684.522,"stop":705.608,"duration":21.09},{"text":"The focus here is on the particular identification confrontation and the circumstances surrounding it.","start":705.608,"stop":712.761,"duration":7.15},{"text":"The Court may consider, for example, any circumstances tending to suggest that the witness should identify a particular person or not identify a particular person.","start":712.761,"stop":725.052,"duration":12.29},{"text":"It may consider the circumstances of the crime, the extent that they have a bearing on the question of suggestiveness.","start":725.052,"stop":734.798,"duration":9.75},{"text":"If and only if the Court should determine that the pretrial identification procedures used were so impermissibly suggestive that they could give rise to a very substantial likelihood of mistaken identification, does it become necessary to determine whether in fact it it is likely that they had this effect.","start":734.798,"stop":757.103,"duration":22.3},{"text":"In making this latter determination the focus is on the reliability of the identification evidence.","start":757.103,"stop":763.301,"duration":6.2},{"text":"It is at this point that the Court applies the five factors stated in Neil v. Biggers, and restated in Manson v. Brathwaite, and any other factors bearing on the question of whether the identification evidence is reliable.","start":763.301,"stop":780.342,"duration":17.04}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
