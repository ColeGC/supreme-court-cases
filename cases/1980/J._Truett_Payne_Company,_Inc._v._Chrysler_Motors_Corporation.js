November, 1973... May, 1974, when Payne went out of business, that the price discrimination totalled about $81,000.","start":606.703,"stop":627.966,"duration":21.26},{"text":"There were 16 rebate programs which caused the price discrimination, and of those 16 programs 13 caused damage to Payne, and that damaged... that Payne was not favored, he was a disfavored dealer in those 13.","start":627.966,"stop":646.078,"duration":18.11},{"text":"Of those other three programs, one of the programs was a program that had a quota established by Chrysler by which the dealer had to reach that quota in order to get paid and Payne reached that one quota and did not get injured in that program.","start":646.078,"stop":664.541,"duration":18.46},{"text":"The other two programs where there was no discrimination were an across the board percentage rebate to everybody on a per car basis, so there was no discrimination at all.","start":664.541,"stop":673.997,"duration":9.46},{"text":"So, out of those 16 programs over a 3-1/2-year period, Payne was injured, was a disfavored dealer in 13 of them.","start":673.997,"stop":683.119,"duration":9.12},{"text":"There was testimony not only by Payne that his company lost business in the form of lost sales, but also that his company in order to maintain sales had to overallow on the used car trade in and that was a factor in the testimony of Dr. Ignatin and in the testimony, as a matter of fact, of Chrysler's witnesses which analyzed the used car business of Payne, saying that, one, that the main problem with Payne was its used car business was losing money.","start":683.119,"stop":722.178,"duration":39.06},{"text":"So you've got the fact that Payne testified that he was overallowing in order to get business coupled with the corroborating testimony that there was a real problem in the used car business, coupled with a factor of substantial, sustained price discriminations over 3-1/2 years.","start":722.178,"stop":741.657,"duration":19.48},{"text":"There was testimony of an actual decline in the market, percentage of the market that Payne had from 1971 and 1972.","start":741.657,"stop":751.663,"duration":10.01},{"text":"There was also testimony that the price discrimination adversely affected competition and injured competition because it had a two pronged effect.","start":751.663,"stop":760.553,"duration":8.89},{"text":"The first thing was that it did not permit Payne to compete on an even and equal basis.","start":760.553,"stop":767.609,"duration":7.06},{"text":"He was at a trade disadvantage because his cars cost more than the other competing dealers.","start":767.609,"stop":773.513,"duration":5.9},{"text":"Secondly, the price of a new car is determined by the discounting off of the list price, and everybody knows that, and the economist that analyzed the industry in Birmingham determined that because the competing dealers, the favored dealers, did not have to discount off list price quite as much as they otherwise would have since they were favored and Payne was not favored with the rebate, with the price discrimination, and because Payne could not discount off list price as much as he otherwise would have done because of the lack of the price rebate, that that raised the price, the ultimate retail price to the consumer in the market to a slight degree.","start":773.513,"stop":823.961,"duration":50.45},{"text":"And the 5th Circuit in its opinion did not consider all of this evidence as giving rise at least to the submission to a jury as to whether or not injury in fact under the antitrust laws could be caused.","start":823.961,"stop":842.157,"duration":18.2},{"text":"The 5th Circuit said that the only way you can prove injury is to prove lost profits or lost sales.","start":842.157,"stop":849.677,"duration":7.52},{"text":"This Court considered the same issue in a different context in Bruce's Juices v. American Can Company, and in that case, although the ultimate finding was much narrower, the Court was faced with an analysis exactly the same as in this case, because the plaintiff in that case had said that the price discrimination statute ought to void the contract involved in the transaction where there was price discrimination.","start":849.677,"stop":881.198,"duration":31.52},{"text":"The court said, and the plaintiff also said, that the treble damage remedy under the Robinson-Patman Act was ineffective.","start":881.198,"stop":888.971,"duration":7.77},{"text":"This Court said, no, because all that there would be normal, or all that would be necessary in the absence of extraordinary circumstances would be to prove the substantial price differential, and that would be damage, and the amount of that damage would be that differential.","start":888.971,"stop":909.551,"duration":20.58},{"text":"In that finding, and it's more than mere dictum...
