provisions.","start":485.18,"stop":493.269,"duration":8.09},{"text":"Although his position is not entirely clear, respondent seems to advance two different interpretations.","start":493.269,"stop":500.458,"duration":7.19},{"text":"First, that access is authorized only for records of costs that are computed or allocated on a product basis and are expressly taken into account in setting the prices for the items sold to the Government.","start":500.458,"stop":513.616,"duration":13.16},{"text":"Or, second, that the right of access is limited to
