Fibreboard through its rationale in Darlington as interpreted by the majority of the circuits, and even, I might suggest, by the two circuits who came to different conclusions and by the National

talked about subcontracting and subcontracting in terms of the employer still exercising control, and all that the employer did in Fibreboard was to replace one group of employees with another group

permissive.","start":382.503,"stop":411.569,"duration":29.07},{"text":"The hard cases, Your Honors, where the courts very often look to the possibility of taint of union animus, are really cases where

there is really a continuation of the same employment relationship but with different employees.","start":411.569,"stop":444.54,"duration":32.97},{"text":"That is not the case which is before
