Court:","start":50.783,"stop":55.385,"duration":4.6},{"text":"The question before this Court is a single point, referred to in Point 1 of petitioner's brief, and that is whether the pledge of securities as collateral for a loan is a sale or a purchase for the purpose of invoking the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Acts.","start":55.385,"stop":89.141,"duration":33.76},{"text":"It is our contention that the pledge is not a sale or purchase under either the 1933 definition of the anti-fraud provisions of the Act, or under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the 1934 Act.","start":89.141,"stop":111.404,"duration":22.26},{"text":"The pledge occurred in this case as the result of series of loans totaling approximately $475,000, by Tri-State Energy, a corporation, by whom petitioner was employed from October 19th, 1972, through December 6th, 1972.","start":111.404,"stop":142.776,"duration":31.37},{"text":"That is to say, the loans were obtained over that period, October 19th, 1972, through December the 6th, 1972.","start":142.776,"stop":152.731,"duration":9.95},{"text":"The loans were evidenced by promissory notes that were executed by the borrower corporation and were individually guaranteed by some of the officers, including the petitioner who was not a stockholder of the corporation.","start":152.731,"stop":177.014,"duration":24.28},{"text":"Side collateral was given for the loan.","start":177.014,"stop":181.818,"duration":4.8},{"text":"And at page 8 of petitioner's brief, the principal witness for the government, an employee of the bank, describes his definition of side collateral to be: that when the loan was made initially the loan was envisioned that it would be repaid from the ongoing operations of the corporation, namely from the sale of coal or natural gas, the collateral was taken as a secondary source of repayment in the event that the primary source, the ongoing operations of the corporation didn't materialize.","start":181.818,"stop":222.311,"duration":40.49},{"text":"Also given by the borrowers at the time were blank stock powers, corporate resolutions authorizing the pledging and hypothecation of securities of the stock as security for the loan.","start":222.311,"stop":238.337,"duration":16.03},{"text":"The loan was defaulted, and I

guaranty.","start":238.337,"stop":254.282,"duration":15.95},{"text":"The evidence of the lawsuit is set forth in the joint appendix at 174(a), which is an affidavit of confession of judgment.","start":254.282,"stop":264.638,"duration":10.36},{"text":"It is undisputed that there was no foreclosure of the securities by the bank, so that actually this Court does not really have to reach any interest in what may have occurred, or interest in the securities as to what may occur if there was a foreclosure.","start":264.638,"stop":287.587,"duration":22.95},{"text":"To that extent, the Fifth and the Seventh Circuit Courts which support petitioner's position here, and goes that far, we submit, is unnecessary for this Court's decision any more than the Second Circuit Court's decision in Mallis, Bankers Trust Company against Mallis, which considers the release of the security by the bank or the pledgee as being a sale within the anti-fraud provisions, is likewise unnecessary to reach the decision in this case.","start":287.587,"stop":324.795,"duration":37.21},{"text":"The charge is set forth, that is, the indictment in this case, is set forth in page 3 of petitioner's brief.","start":324.795,"stop":337.186,"duration":12.39},{"text":"This was a conspiracy plus two substantive counts, Counts I, II, and III.","start":337.186,"stop":344.757,"duration":7.57},{"text":"The conspiracy encompassed a charge of violating three objects: the only one that we're concerned with is the one which charged a violation of Section 17(a)(1) in the offer and sale of a security, pursuant to a scheme to defraud.","start":344.757,"stop":368.472,"duration":23.71},{"text":"And that was under Section 77X of the 1933 Securities Act.","start":368.472,"stop":377.93,"duration":9.46},{"text":"I should add that petitioner was acquitted of the substantive charge in Count III, which was a violation of Section 17(a)(1) of the 1933 Act.","start":377.93,"stop":392.254,"duration":14.32},{"text":"He was convicted of the conspiracy which encompassed the three objects.","start":392.254,"stop":396.891,"duration":4.64},{"text":"With respect to the second count which was a substantive count, also one of the objects of the conspiracy, to defraud the bank of the half million dollars in violation of Section 1014 of Title 18, the jury had... and incidentally, which subsumed all of the alleged fraud in the pledging of the securities in Count I, and that appears at page 28 of our brief footnote in the statement of the prosecutor, the jury did not reach a verdict on Count II.","start":396.891,"stop":436.885,"duration":39.99},{"text":"But the prosecutor, after the jury had convicted of conspiracy, agreed to concede to a judgment of acquittal.","start":436.885,"stop":446.491,"duration":9.61},{"text":"Petitioner does not mount any challenge to the fraud alleged in this case, and of course, that's prominently brought out by my learned brother; but the fact is that since the issue, we feel, is one of law, we assume the fraud for that purpose.","start":446.491,"stop":477.01,"duration":30.52},{"text":"It does not necessarily mean that we concede the fraud.","start":477.01,"stop":482.497,"duration":5.49},{"text":"Petitioner contends that no matter how the fraud alleged in the pledge of the collateral, the pledge transaction did not constitute a sale under Section 17(a)(1) of the 1933 Act or Section 10b or Rule 10b-5 of the 1934 Act, and that therefore, the conviction must be reversed.","start":482.497,"stop":514.301,"duration":31.8},{"text":"Now we take this position because in accordance with the decisions in the Fifth Circuit and in the Seventh Circuit, with which we agree, we believe that if we were to, as the government argues, or my learned brother argues, extend the anti-fraud provisions of the 1933 Act to a pledge, an ordinary, garden variety pledge of stock as collateral for a loan to the terms sale in the 1933 Act or purchase in the 1934 Act, it would add a gloss to the operative language of the statute which, we submit, was not intended by Congress in view of the commonly accepted meaning of those words, sale and purchase.","start":514.301,"stop":580.761,"duration":66.46}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A.
