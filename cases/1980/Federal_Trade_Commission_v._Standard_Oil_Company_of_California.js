have reason to believe that any corporation is using any unfair method of competition and if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding in respect thereof to be in the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve on the respondent a complaint, which requires an answer, administer the proceedings to establish the proof of the allegations set out therein, and then the issuance, in case the allegations are established, of a cease and desist order which, unless overturned by a court on review or unless the period for review, which is 60 days, has expired, then becomes enforceable.","start":113.006,"stop":164.022,"duration":51.02},{"text":"This case presents important questions of administrative law and it requires the Court to answer a question that might be stated as follows: This case requires the Court to decide whether during the pendency of an administrative proceeding a district court that concededly cannot review the sufficiency of what is alleged in the agency complaint to constitute its reason to believe that certain firms have violated the law, can nevertheless determine whether the agency in fact made the reason to believe determination that caused it to file the complaint.","start":164.022,"stop":208.135,"duration":44.11},{"text":"The case arises out of the following factual situation.","start":208.135,"stop":213.039,"duration":4.9},{"text":"The Federal Trade Commission in 1971 authorized an investigation to determine whether the structure of the petroleum industry caused it, or contributed to its engaging in unfair trade practices.","start":213.039,"stop":233.202,"duration":20.16},{"text":"The investigation was concerned with competition, principally at the refining end of the petroleum industry, and had very little to do with the crude oil or importation end of it.","start":233.202,"stop":247.51,"duration":14.31},{"text":"The method in which the staff conducted the investigation consisted essentially of seeking information from independent operators and not directly from the principal vertically integrated corporations by calling in their officers or by subpoenaing their records.","start":247.51,"stop":272.493,"duration":24.98},{"text":"It also consisted of seeking information from several governmental agencies that had the responsibility of collecting data about the petroleum industry.","start":272.493,"stop":284.551,"duration":12.06},{"text":"This began in 1971.","start":284.551,"stop":287.687,"duration":3.14},{"text":"In 1973 when the nation first experienced an acute fuel shortage, Senator Henry Jackson sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission Chairman requesting that within 30 days the Commission write a report on the relationship between the structure of the petroleum industry and the shortage of petroleum products that was afflicting the country.","start":287.687,"stop":315.504,"duration":27.82},{"text":"That was May, 1973.","start":315.504,"stop":317.872,"duration":2.37},{"text":"On July 6, 1973, the Federal Trade Commission submitted to Senator Jackson a commission report

those of the Commission.","start":334.751,"stop":348.493,"duration":13.74},{"text":"It also asked that the report not be given undue publicity because it might jeopardize subsequent prosecution.","start":348.493,"stop":357.766,"duration":9.27},{"text":"On July 13, seven days later, Senator Jackson released the preliminary report for publication as a committee report.","start":357.766,"stop":369.824,"duration":12.06},{"text":"On July 18, then, the Commission, having on the previous July 17 issued a report stating that it intended to file a complaint, caused its complaint to be filed naming the eight petroleum companies that were respondents before the Commission and are respondents here, charging that they were violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that it had reason to believe that that fact existed, and that it was in the public interest to proceed to a hearing on the allegations that the complaint set forth, describing the acts and practices claimed to be in violation of the Act.","start":369.824,"stop":415.02,"duration":45.2},{"text":"Standard Oil of California, one of the eight named petroleum companies, moved the

1974.","start":439.735,"stop":446.741,"duration":7.01},{"text":"Respondent then sought reconsideration of this order and on June 4, 1974, the Commission denied the motion for rehearing and reiterated its previous determination that the adequacy of the Commission's \"reason to believe\" that a violation of the law had occurred, and its belief that a proceeding would be in the public interest, was not litigable.","start":446.741,"stop":474.391,"duration":27.65},{"text":"The Commission staff then proceeded with discovery to prepare to prove the allegations set forth in the administrative complaint and Standard Oil of California and the other seven respondent petroleum companies vigorously resisted its efforts for discovery.","start":474.391,"stop":494.055,"duration":19.66},{"text":"Eleven months later, on May 1, 1975, Standard Oil of California filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
