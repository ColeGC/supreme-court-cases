Michael C., that Miranda meant what it said; that unless... at least as far as the police reinterrogation... once the accused has been read his Miranda rights and says he'd like to have a lawyer, that there shall be no reinterrogation until a lawyer is provided.","start":281.891,"stop":310.832,"duration":28.94},{"text":"This case demonstrates, I think, why that often is no great burden, because there was no reason that the interrogation couldn't have been carried out after 1:30 on the 20th of January.","start":310.832,"stop":323.39,"duration":12.56},{"text":"Instead it was carried out on the morning of 20 January, hours before Edwards would be making his first appearance and at a time when the police were aware that Edwards as an indigent would be appointed counsel that afternoon.","start":323.39,"stop":339.445,"duration":16.06},{"text":"They knew that he was about to get a lawyer.","start":339.445,"stop":341.366,"duration":1.92}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

Meehan","textObjs":[{"text":"That's true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.","start":363.576,"stop":365.498,"duration":1.92},{"text":"And, indeed, in Miranda, what was said was, we're not holding that the police have to have a lawyer in every precinct.","start":365.498,"stop":371.605,"duration":6.11},{"text":"But I'd like to emphasize two things about this case.","start":371.605,"stop":374.369,"duration":2.76},{"text":"One, the case was solved.","start":374.369,"stop":376.414,"duration":2.04},{"text":"They were not looking for additional offenders, they were not further investigating the case, they were not looking for the fruits or the instrumentalities of the crime such as may have been a justification in Innis had that been held to have been an interrogation, they were not trying to locate the body as was the case in Brewer v. Williams, there was no urgency.","start":376.414,"stop":400.795,"duration":24.38},{"text":"And even under Miranda it seems to me, once the accused says, I would like a lawyer, he's indicating that he feels that he needs to have that help, he needs to have somebody with him; he's acknowledging that the inherent coercive atmosphere, custodial interrogation, which is the focus of the Miranda guarantee, and the reason for the warnings and affording the right to counsel is affecting him.","start":400.795,"stop":425.863,"duration":25.07}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

Meehan","textObjs":[{"text":"I think I would treat it as having been solved by virtue of what the police felt at the time that they undertook the interrogation, and I think, number one, it would be somewhat unrealistic to have a set of facts in which there were three different statements without Miranda rights having been read to them.","start":498.897,"stop":514.999,"duration":16.1},{"text":"But secondly, it seems to me the focus has to be at the time of the interrogation.","start":514.999,"stop":518.716,"duration":3.72},{"text":"What was the motive of the police in undertaking this interrogation?","start":518.716,"stop":522.512,"duration":3.8},{"text":"At that time the offense was old, they were not, you know, on the trail of additional accomplices.","start":522.512,"stop":530.634,"duration":8.12},{"text":"They felt, as the State said in its opener, its responsor brief, they felt they had enough evidence.","start":530.634,"stop":537.976,"duration":7.34},{"text":"That's exactly what the State said in its brief, and they did.","start":537.976,"stop":540.413,"duration":2.44},{"text":"And they presented it to a magistrate, and a magistrate then has the right and the obligation to weigh that evidence, to cross-examine the complaining officer, to determine whether or not there's probable cause to believe that an offense was committed, and the defendant committed it, and if so to in effect file the complaint, which is to say, to approve the complaint and then to issue the arrest warrant.","start":540.413,"stop":562.091,"duration":21.68},{"text":"There are, of course, two issues presented in this case, one under Miranda and one under the Sixth Amendment.","start":562.091,"stop":578.601,"duration":16.51},{"text":"Because the State has recently chosen to argue that no formal prosecution had begun in this case, I would like to spend more time talking about the Sixth Amendment aspects of it than the Miranda aspects.","start":578.601,"stop":592.861,"duration":14.26},{"text":"As I said, in the courts below and in its briefs in this Court, except the supplemental brief, the State has agreed with the Petitioner that at the time of this interrogation formal prosecution had begun and the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment as a critical stage had arisen.","start":592.861,"stop":616.148,"duration":23.29},{"text":"A week ago the State contended on the virtue of a Second Circuit case construing federal criminal rules of procedure that no formal prosecution had begun.","start":616.148,"stop":628.096,"duration":11.95},{"text":"I think the State was correct in its first position.","start":628.096,"stop":630.877,"duration":2.78},{"text":"In Arizona, under the criminal rules, prosecution may be commenced in two ways, either by indictment or by complaint.","start":630.877,"stop":640.389,"duration":9.51},{"text":"In this case prosecution was commenced by the filing of a complaint.","start":640.389,"stop":644.791,"duration":4.4}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
