right to petition the Governor of the sending state to review the custody request, and secondly, the absence of a pretransfer hearing violated his right to due process.","start":241.293,"stop":255.303,"duration":14.01},{"text":"And secondly, the fact that the state did not provide him with a pretransfer hearing as in the case of a transfer under the Extradition Act deprived him of the equal protection of the laws.","start":255.303,"stop":268.36,"duration":13.06},{"text":"The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.","start":268.36,"stop":274.311,"duration":5.95},{"text":"An appeal was taken to the 3rd Circuit and that court held as a matter of statutory construction, never reaching

specifically.","start":274.311,"stop":292.553,"duration":18.24}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

unreasonable to assume that every time the word extradition is used a pretransfer hearing is implied.","start":421.83,"stop":433.622,"duration":11.79},{"text":"Neither the Extradition Clause nor the federal implementing legislation nor the definition of this Court of the term \"extradition\" would imply a pretransfer hearing.","start":433.622,"stop":446.321,"duration":12.7},{"text":"Your Honor,

Agreement.","start":446.321,"stop":462.33,"duration":16.01},{"text":"And Article I, the last sentence of Article I, states that it is the purpose of the Agreement to provide cooperative procedures.","start":462.33,"stop":469.592,"duration":7.26},{"text":"The Article had been talking of the need to have cooperative procedures when there is an interstate transfer of prisoners and the

framers had not intended to set out a complete self-contained system, a complete procedure within the four corners of the Agreement, I think that they would have so specified.","start":501.875,"stop":514.589,"duration":12.71},{"text":"They would have set out a particular procedure and they would not have stated in Article I that it is the purpose of the Agreement to provide the procedures.","start":514.589,"stop":524.665,"duration":10.08},{"text":"So I believe that the interpretation of the Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit goes against the clear intent set out in Article I of the Agreement.","start":524.665,"stop":535.551,"duration":10.89}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Ms. Vickers, could you help me with one

statute itself does not provide that he be advised.","start":555.745,"stop":560.572,"duration":4.83},{"text":"However, the forms which have been adopted by all of the states for the promulgation of the procedures within the Agreement advises the prisoner when a detainer is lodged against him that he has several options.","start":560.572,"stop":573.521,"duration":12.95},{"text":"A detainer has been lodged against him and he may under Article III proceed to seek final resolution of the detainer, or under Article IV... and they give the procedures to be followed.","start":573.521,"stop":587.389,"duration":13.87}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Was this particular respondent given that

way.","start":590.201,"stop":593.356,"duration":3.15}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Because he alleges he did not know about his right to filing.","start":593.356,"stop":594.966,"duration":1.61}]},{"speakerName":"Maria Parisi Vickers","textObjs":[{"text":"Your Honor, he alleges, he discussed only the time frame from when the custody request was received by the state.","start":594.966,"stop":604.665,"duration":9.7},{"text":"There is no discussion as to the detainer, when the detainer was first filed.","start":604.665,"stop":608.07,"duration":3.41},{"text":"And I would submit, therefore, that the record is unclear as to whether he received notice of the filing of the detainer or Form

incomplete on that issue.","start":618.784,"stop":624.766,"duration":5.98}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"But then don't we have to accept his claim that he didn't know about this right as probably a valid claim?","start":624.766,"stop":630.857,"duration":6.09}]},{"speakerName":"Maria Parisi Vickers","textObjs":[{"text":"Your Honor, normally I would agree with you but in this particular case I think that there is a lack of information on that point.","start":630.857,"stop":638.354,"duration":7.5},{"text":"He speaks only of when the custody request was lodged.","start":638.354,"stop":641.587,"duration":3.23},{"text":"He does not speak of any prior period of time.","start":641.587,"stop":645.008,"duration":3.42},{"text":"He does not say specifically that he did not receive notice of a detainer.","start":645.008,"stop":648.882,"duration":3.87},{"text":"The complaint doesn't say that.","start":648.882,"stop":651.552,"duration":2.67}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, but even if he had notice of the detainer, it wouldn't necessarily mean that he had notice of his right to make a request with the Governor within that 30-day period.","start":651.552,"stop":661.283,"duration":9.73}]},{"speakerName":"Maria Parisi Vickers","textObjs":[{"text":"Your Honor, as I was stating, when the prisoner receives notice of the detainer, he receives it through a form, Form 1.","start":661.283,"stop":667.953,"duration":6.67}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"How do we know that?","start":667.953,"stop":668.624,"duration":0.67},{"text":"Not that I

us?","start":671.389,"stop":673.777,"duration":2.39}]},{"speakerName":"Maria Parisi Vickers","textObjs":[{"text":"No, Your Honor.","start":673.777,"stop":676.011,"duration":2.23},{"text":"Your Honor, to continue on the issue of the interpretation of the Article IV(d) by the 3rd Circuit, it appears that the 3rd Circuit interpretation would have us assume that every state which adopts the Interstate Agreement on Detainers has a Uniform Extradition Act.","start":676.011,"stop":707.639,"duration":31.63},{"text":"And this is just not so.","start":707.639,"stop":709.436,"duration":1.8},{"text":"There

from a statute which may not exist in a particular state.","start":713.948,"stop":724.086,"duration":10.14},{"text":"On the other hand, the Court of Appeals decision may be construed as to mean that whatever statute on extradition exists in that state should be applied.","start":724.086,"stop":734.425,"duration":10.34},{"text":"Well, Your Honors, if it please the Court, I would submit that that

country.","start":734.425,"stop":749.872,"duration":15.45},{"text":"This is the intent of the framers, this is what is going to facilitate transfers.","start":749.872,"stop":756.838,"duration":6.97},{"text":"And to have the result that the procedures are going to differ depending on the particular extradition statute in each state is simply absurd.","start":756.838,"stop":766.085,"duration":9.25},{"text":"It defeats both the character of the statute in its uniformity, and it defeats the purpose of the Agreement
