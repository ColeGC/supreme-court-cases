contracts in the law.","start":1034.448,"stop":1076.375,"duration":41.93},{"text":"After all, they are agreements, serious agreements, which the parties intend to define their relationship and the

prerequisites are, and the difficulties of obtaining relief.","start":1125.307,"stop":1143.336,"duration":18.03},{"text":"The purpose of Section 301 is to end those difficulties and to provide in

says.","start":1143.336,"stop":1166.284,"duration":22.95},{"text":"I think, too, that the evolution of the section, the fact the Congress completed its work in the House and the Senate and went to conference and said, this section is incomplete as it stands because it only covers contracts between employers and labor organizations, indicates that Congress must have been of the view that contracts between labor organizations ought to be enforceable in the same way as contracts between labor organizations and employers in order to accomplish the congressional end, and we think that in
