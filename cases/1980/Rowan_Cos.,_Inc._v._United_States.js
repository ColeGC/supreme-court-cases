significant because this was long before codification of the convenience rule in Section 119 and it's significant because of the legislative history of the income tax withholding, in which Congress

taxes.","start":670.585,"stop":700.938,"duration":30.35},{"text":"Then still later, in 1978, when Section 119 was amended by Congress to make the exclusion apply to meals furnished for the convenience
