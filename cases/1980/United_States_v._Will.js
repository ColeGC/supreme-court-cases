Government from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois which declared unconstitutional four Acts of Congress that were passed in consecutive years between 1976 and 1979

Executive Branch, and federal judges.","start":19.545,"stop":53.718,"duration":34.17},{"text":"The District Judge held that to the extent these pay freeze statutes applied to judges, they violated the compensation clause of Article III of the Constitution.","start":53.718,"stop":64.173,"duration":10.45},{"text":"The District Court also held that as a matter of statutory construction the statutes

cost-of-living increase but were instead only appropriations measures that refused to provide the money for salary increases required by law.","start":73.798,"stop":88.641,"duration":14.84},{"text":"The Government in these appeals has challenged each of these holdings.","start":88.641,"stop":92.926,"duration":4.28},{"text":"Before

determined.","start":92.926,"stop":106.435,"duration":13.51},{"text":"For the first 180 years of our Nation's history, judicial salaries were fixed by Congress essentially on an ad hoc basis.","start":106.435,"stop":114.606,"duration":8.17},{"text":"During this period Congress raised the salaries of Supreme Court Justices on 12 occasions and raised the salaries of lower court judges on nine occasions.","start":114.606,"stop":124.231,"duration":9.63},{"text":"Congress finally changed this system in 1967 by passing the Federal Salary Act.","start":124.231,"stop":131.218,"duration":6.99},{"text":"Under this Act the salaries of federal judges as well as the Vice President, Members of Congress, Cabinet officers, and selected other

1975 passed the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act.","start":206.033,"stop":214.539,"duration":8.51},{"text":"This Act applies, by and large, to the officials covered by the Federal Salary Act, including federal judges.","start":214.539,"stop":221.478,"duration":6.94},{"text":"Now, under the Adjustment Act judicial salaries are subject to an annual increase equal to the annual

1970.","start":221.478,"stop":240.606,"duration":19.13},{"text":"Under The Comparability Act the President each year must designate a pay agent to compare civil service salaries with the rates of pay

options.","start":264.238,"stop":268.958,"duration":4.72},{"text":"First, he can inform Congress that he agrees with and adopts the agent's recommendation, in which event the recommended cost-of-living increase automatically goes into effect as of the first pay period after October 1st of that year.","start":268.958,"stop":282.949,"duration":13.99},{"text":"On the other hand, if

recommendation and submit an alternative pay raise plan to Congress.","start":282.949,"stop":301.697,"duration":18.75},{"text":"If neither House of Congress disapproves the President's alternative
