be entitled to.","start":492.153,"stop":512.966,"duration":20.81},{"text":"In the legislative history, Congress expressly stated its view that spouses should be expected to support each

of the statute for at least three reasons.","start":548.323,"stop":554.06,"duration":5.74},{"text":"First, it is inconsistent with the language of the statute which provides that the states may consider the income of an applicant's spouse for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility and for the purpose of determining the amount of assistance an applicant may be entitled to.","start":554.06,"stop":571.938,"duration":17.88},{"text":"This is an initial step.","start":571.938,"stop":574.124,"duration":2.19},{"text":"Respondent has never attempted... or, never explained

determinations.","start":574.124,"stop":598.255,"duration":24.13},{"text":"Second, this interpretation of the statute would require the filing of thousands of tiny lawsuits, sometimes perhaps several against the same individual, since the payments are made by the state monthly or quarterly and the spouse... and, at the same time the state would be continuing to pay benefits to an individual who may or may not be eligible for benefits.","start":598.255,"stop":625.94,"duration":27.69},{"text":"And finally, if Congress intended to create such a distinction or such an administrative scheme which would have required the states to spend a great deal of money filing all of these lawsuits, trying to recover money that they shouldn't have had to pay out in the first place, one would expect that something in the legislative history would have been said about this.","start":625.94,"stop":649.655,"duration":23.71},{"text":"There is absolutely no support in the legislative history suggesting
