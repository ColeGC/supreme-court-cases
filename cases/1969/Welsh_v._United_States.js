the petitioner didn't get the conscientious objector classification.","start":12.656,"stop":23.684,"duration":11.03},{"text":"Everyone concedes that he was truthful and sincere.","start":23.684,"stop":28.545,"duration":4.86},{"text":"He is not an atheist so that isn't involved.","start":28.545,"stop":31.059,"duration":2.51},{"text":"He objects to all wars, so that's not involved.","start":31.059,"stop":35.227,"duration":4.17},{"text":"But the main objection of the Government is that his religion when which he started out by saying, “I'm nonreligious” is the bone of contention.","start":35.227,"stop":47.458,"duration":12.23},{"text":"Before we get to the First Amendment point, I would like to deal with the two threshold matters that could be dispositive of the case.","start":47.458,"stop":61.126,"duration":13.67},{"text":"The first is the short circuit, the corner cutting by the Government at the induction proceedings.","start":61.126,"stop":71.278,"duration":10.15},{"text":"I have briefed I think as adequately as I can one point raise by the Government that there must be a showing of prejudice.","start":71.278,"stop":79.979,"duration":8.7},{"text":"I rely on the Ninth Circuit rational in Welsh and in rather in Briggs and then Oshatz.","start":79.979,"stop":90.937,"duration":10.96},{"text":"One point of the Government I didn't deal with adequately in the briefing is that the Government argues that the security questionnaire is for the benefit of the Army.","start":90.937,"stop":107.919,"duration":16.98},{"text":"Now, that's the same argument that was made by the Government when the Briggs matter of not getting the last minute cursory inspection came up is the same argument that was argued by the Government, used by the Government in the Welsh matter when he didn't get tendered to him the security questionnaire, and for the rational in there, they decided that it was required.","start":107.919,"stop":133.151,"duration":25.23},{"text":"Now, the same thing runs through the thread here.","start":133.151,"stop":136.515,"duration":3.36},{"text":"There is one point though that it's not too material and that is, of the Government keeps saying that he refuse.","start":136.515,"stop":143.712,"duration":7.2},{"text":"Actually, he didn't refuse, he raised the question, and then, the best reason why they short circuited him is in the one sentence statement of the Government rather in the opinion -- the majority opinion below that district judge who wrote the opinion concurred in by one of the circuit judges.","start":143.712,"stop":170.193,"duration":26.48},{"text":"They put up this way rather than delay appellant's induction pending investigation, induction station personnel ordered him to step forward.","start":170.193,"stop":181.473,"duration":11.28},{"text":"That's his brief description of the short circuit as possible.","start":181.473,"stop":184.958,"duration":3.48},{"text":"Now, my thought is this, as long as it's a part of the Army regulation that no man shall -- no selectee shall be inducted when he either qualifies or refuses to execute the oath pending a thorough investigation.","start":184.958,"stop":205.614,"duration":20.66},{"text":"He's entitled to that.","start":205.614,"stop":207.658,"duration":2.04},{"text":"And just as in these other cases I mentioned, that was held to have sufficient prejudice, it should apply here, because not as the Government argues that he can -- by that avoid induction possibly for months enforcing the military to waste its intelligence resources, all the Government has to do.","start":207.658,"stop":229.815,"duration":22.16},{"text":"I mean, all of the Army has to do is strike out a few words, substitute a word or two and they can have it in the Federal Register in two or three dates.","start":229.815,"stop":239.643,"duration":9.83},{"text":"Now, fortunately for the security of a country, the Army is alert and when it sees things that it should deal with it does fairly prompt.","start":239.643,"stop":249.008,"duration":9.37},{"text":"For example, when I get back in the practice in 44, about the first man in the office was Yost.","start":249.008,"stop":257.649,"duration":8.64},{"text":"He was on-leave from Camp Roberts where he said he'd been forcibly inducted.","start":257.649,"stop":262.592,"duration":4.94},{"text":"He testified in the trial court.","start":262.592,"stop":265.614,"duration":3.02},{"text":"I was standing with a great many other men who had passed the physical examination and the inducting officer came over and said, hold up your right hands and repeat the oath after me.","start":265.614,"stop":279.519,"duration":13.91},{"text":"Testified as one Jehovah's Witnesses, I couldn't take an oath, I didn't raise my right hand, I said nothing.","start":279.519,"stop":286.164,"duration":6.64},{"text":"The trial judge believed and granted the writ.","start":286.164,"stop":288.607,"duration":2.44},{"text":"The Government took an appeal.","start":288.607,"stop":290.466,"duration":1.86},{"text":"But before an en banc decision affirming the appeal, the Government saw the light, the Army saw the light, and it changed the induction proceeding crucial point, point of no return from an oath to a stepping forward.","start":290.466,"stop":307.977,"duration":17.51},{"text":"Now, that still persist to this day, that's the way it's done for selectees to become inductee.","start":307.977,"stop":314.251,"duration":6.27},{"text":"Ten years later though, the Army -- I had to consider another matter and that's when Corrigan came in the office.","start":314.251,"stop":321.338,"duration":7.09},{"text":"These are reported appellate, the decisions of course and Corrigan says, “I'm in the stockade at the Fort Ord and I'm here because I'm trying to make a good soldier out of me.”","start":321.338,"stop":332.951,"duration":11.61},{"text":"When I asked him, “How's coming if you're in the stockade you're here?”","start":332.951,"stop":336.454,"duration":3.5},{"text":"He testified, we were seated in a theater-like arrangement.","start":336.454,"stop":343.261,"duration":6.81},{"text":"I was in the back row when we've jumped up as the sergeant told us to do and the officer came in.","start":343.261,"stop":351.436,"duration":8.17},{"text":"The officer said, “And now, when I call a name of each of you, you'll take one step forward and that step is in the Army of the United States.”","start":351.436,"stop":362.052,"duration":10.62},{"text":"He said, the members so crowded that no one except in a front row could do anything but shuffle to speak.","start":362.052,"stop":368.336,"duration":6.28},{"text":"They shuffled, I didn't shuffle.","start":368.336,"stop":370.163,"duration":1.83},{"text":"I didn't make a move.","start":370.163,"stop":372.406,"duration":2.24},{"text":"The trial judge decided it in another way asking, “When did you make up your mind that you're a conscientious objector?”","start":372.406,"stop":378.768,"duration":6.36},{"text":"He said, “While I was standing there.”","start":378.768,"stop":380.61,"duration":1.84},{"text":"The judge set us too late and I couldn't do anything about it.","start":380.61,"stop":383.477,"duration":2.87},{"text":"It's never too late to face civil penalties rather than go into the military service.","start":383.477,"stop":388.014,"duration":4.54},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals unanimously, reversed on the basis that there was no evidence that he'd moved to state board and I think that one thing that helped them to reach that opinion was an affidavit that I filed with the closing brief and which I said, “I've gone down to the induction station and I see that they've seen the light.”","start":388.014,"stop":407.647,"duration":19.63},{"text":"They now have a different procedure, they have a roll of chairs around three sides facing the podium as everybody can see the podium and they have a white line painted four feet from the wall.","start":407.647,"stop":422.464,"duration":14.82},{"text":"So, the man can see when they cross the -- when they cross the Rubicon or any of expression you might want.","start":422.464,"stop":429.015,"duration":6.55},{"text":"So that the Army learns and I say that in other cases for example, I won't belabor it.","start":429.015,"stop":434.586,"duration":5.57},{"text":"I'll just cite one more reported case on the trial level ex parte Barielle (ph).","start":434.586,"stop":441.548,"duration":6.96},{"text":"When Barielle (ph) secured the writ down in San Diego, the record which we got from the Selective Service System show that he was a married man and that was in the Selective Services System records.","start":441.548,"stop":458.267,"duration":16.72},{"text":"It was quite a bit of publicity.","start":458.267,"stop":460.157,"duration":1.89},{"text":"It is Stars and Stripes of Europe, Stars and Stripes of the Orient so it alarmed the Army.","start":460.157,"stop":465.188,"duration":5.03},{"text":"And what they did, they got the Selective Service System to change the regulation from saying that a husband is to be given 3-A to father and that's the way it is today.","start":465.188,"stop":478.532,"duration":13.34},{"text":"And many other illustrations can be given at the Selective Services -- the one word change.","start":478.532,"stop":482.729,"duration":4.2},{"text":"I don't want to belabor it but if there's any question about that, there are many can be recited.","start":482.729,"stop":488.568,"duration":5.84},{"text":"So, I say that as long as it's the law, I think that Government agency should follow its own regulations.","start":488.568,"stop":496.799,"duration":8.23},{"text":"It may -- it can do a way with them in a few days.","start":496.799,"stop":500.563,"duration":3.76},{"text":"Now, the next point I wish to go in to is also one, that if the Court agrees on me can be dispositive of a case and that is the point that which if he had been before this Court some years ago when Seeger with the other two different consolidated for the oral argument for decision Jacobson and Peter.","start":500.563,"stop":523.342,"duration":22.78},{"text":"I say he would've had exactly the same
