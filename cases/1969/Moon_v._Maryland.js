completely retroactive effect to this case before the Court today, that is Moon.","start":241.972,"stop":266.962,"duration":24.99},{"text":"I would like to say further Your Honor that I do not believe

effect.","start":266.962,"stop":280.493,"duration":13.53},{"text":"I would say to the Court that North Carolina versus Pearce was a case of first impression to this Court and I intend to argue it

in the laws expounded by United States versus Ball or Stroud versus United States, but was a new case.","start":293.653,"stop":305.512,"duration":11.86},{"text":"I would also state that under the facts of this case, the three criteria stated for instance, the purpose of the new rule in this case as I understand it is to allow a free and uninhibited right to appellate review in the state and federal courts of the United States.","start":305.512,"stop":324.237,"duration":18.73},{"text":"Certainly, this purpose and the Court has so stated in Stovall I believe that this purpose is controlling unless the questions of reliance or burden are such as to overcome it.","start":324.237,"stop":336.205,"duration":11.97},{"text":"I submit to the Court that those factors are not of such a factor.","start":336.205,"stop":341.932,"duration":5.73},{"text":"I would say this as to reliance that the Court in Benton for instance talked about collateral estoppel.","start":341.932,"stop":349.165,"duration":7.23},{"text":"Now the state may have -- I would say first the state had no old rule to rely on and I will approach that in later.","start":349.165,"stop":357.241,"duration":8.08},{"text":"Since they had no right rule to rely on, even if they did rely on the Maryland law, and of course they would argue that, there was no

decision.","start":357.241,"stop":376.313,"duration":19.07},{"text":"And if the Court will note at page 38 of the state's brief, they concede that of the 85 persons retried who that is, were
