be served by the new rule and it has been further held that when the purpose of the new rule is to ensure fair trials and reliable verdicts, in other words, to ensure integrity of the factfinding process, then that consideration is paramount and other consideration such as reliance by law enforcement officials or in adverse effect upon the administration of justice, deserve a little consideration.", "start": 480.429, "stop": 511.763, "duration": 31.33}, {"text": "And we submit that under that philosophy, that the Jackson decision must also be given the retroactive effect which we
