Selective Service Act of 1967 precludes pre-induction judicial review of delinquency, reclassification processes by local draft board against a full time undergraduate student who is statutorily entitled to a II-S classification simply because he surrendered his draft card to a clergymen to register his dissent against the war in Vietnam.","start":43.062,"stop":75.504,"duration":32.44},{"text":"Put another way, the question is, does Oestereich control this case or does Gabriel control it?","start":75.504,"stop":83.513,"duration":8.01},{"text":"The facts in the case are admitted for purposes of this appeal and are further agreed to and the agreed statement on appeal which is part of the appendix.","start":83.513,"stop":97.854,"duration":14.34},{"text":"The petitioner at the time in question was a 19-year old undergraduate student at the Berklee School of Music in 1967, a school located in Boston, Massachusetts.","start":97.854,"stop":111.312,"duration":13.46},{"text":"At that time, he was satisfactorily pursuing a full time course of instruction at the college and was properly classified by his local board, board number 16 in Bridgeport, Connecticut as a II-S for the academic year in 1967 to 1968.","start":111.312,"stop":131.094,"duration":19.78},{"text":"At all relevant times, the petitioner maintained the necessary status for his II-S in full compliance with all of the statutory requirements.","start":131.094,"stop":143.459,"duration":12.37},{"text":"On November 16th 1967, the petitioner along with numerous others took part in a meeting at the Arlington Street Church in Boston protesting the war in Vietnam and in the course of this meeting delivered his registration certificate along with a number of other registrants to a clergymen for the sole purpose of registering his dissent against the war in Vietnam.","start":143.459,"stop":171.722,"duration":28.26},{"text":"The action by the petitioner was peaceful.","start":171.722,"stop":174.712,"duration":2.99},{"text":"It was nonviolent and it was expressed as a form of speech under the First Amendment.","start":174.712,"stop":180.778,"duration":6.07},{"text":"A few weeks prior to this occasion, a memorandum and letter was issued from the director of Selective Service General Hershey which was addressed to all members and officials of the Selective Service System.","start":180.778,"stop":197.757,"duration":16.98},{"text":"This memorandum and letter which we will herein after refer to as the Hershey directive and instructed and advised the members of the system to strip deferments and exemptions from all registrants who in anyway violate the Selective Service regulations or its related processes or who take part in any so-called illegal demonstrations.","start":197.757,"stop":223.028,"duration":25.27},{"text":"The directive further recommended that the delinquency reclassification induction procedure be pursued for any registrant who abandons his draft card or his classification card.","start":223.028,"stop":239.138,"duration":16.11},{"text":"Subsequent to the action by the petitioner on January 9th, 1968, he received a simultaneous declaration of delinquency and reclassification in the mail, reclassification from II-S to I-A.","start":239.138,"stop":253.556,"duration":14.42},{"text":"This was a clear implementation of the directive of General Hershey and as the court below aptly put it, it was certainly in line with this directive.","start":253.556,"stop":263.39,"duration":9.83},{"text":"The ground set forth in the delinquency notice were “failure to have registrations certificate in your possession”.","start":263.39,"stop":271.199,"duration":7.81},{"text":"Two days later, the petitioner was ordered for a physical examination and in early February of 1968, he appealed his reclassification.","start":271.199,"stop":282.232,"duration":11.03},{"text":"The litigation below was commenced on February 20th, 1968 in the District Court for Connecticut wherein a declaratory judgment and injunction and other relief was asked by way of a remedy on behalf of the petitioner together with other forms of relief including damages.","start":282.232,"stop":304.114,"duration":21.88},{"text":"The initial hearing before that Court took place on March 1st 1968 where a temporary restraining order was obtained.","start":304.114,"stop":311.417,"duration":7.3},{"text":"However, on March 8, 1968, all of the petitioner’s claims for relief were denied, the temporary restraining order was dissolved and the respondent's motion to dismiss was granted primarily on the grounds that 10 (b) (3) deprived the District Court of jurisdiction.","start":311.417,"stop":331.123,"duration":19.71},{"text":"On April 30, 1968, subsequent to the litigation, the Appeal Board for Connecticut confirmed the classification of the petitioner's I-A.","start":331.123,"stop":341.986,"duration":10.86},{"text":"Prior to that time had passed his physical examination and was ordered to report for induction.","start":341.986,"stop":347.933,"duration":5.95},{"text":"He has not reported for induction based on stays obtained by the District Court subsequently by the Court of Appeals and eventually by this Court.","start":347.933,"stop":357.121,"duration":9.19},{"text":"The rationale by the Court of Appeals in upholding the action of the District Court was geared clearly to differentiation which it drew between this Court's decisions and Oestereich and in Gabriel.","start":357.121,"stop":374.471,"duration":17.35},{"text":"The Court held that Oestereich was distinguishable based on a demarcation between exemption and deferment under the statute with extremely heavy reliance upon Gabriel.","start":374.471,"stop":386.907,"duration":12.44},{"text":"Petitioner contends that the essential error below is in the failure of the majority in its opinion to identify the case as it should have with Oestereich rather than with Gabriel.","start":386.907,"stop":399.859,"duration":12.95},{"text":"We submit that the Oestereich case clearly and unmistakably controls the case at bar and we submit this initially for factual reasons because the salient facts in both Oestereich and in a case at bar are absolutely identical in at least seven respects.","start":399.859,"stop":419.646,"duration":19.79},{"text":"In the first place, both cases involved full time undergraduate students.","start":419.646,"stop":425.963,"duration":6.32},{"text":"Second, both involved the surrender of draft cards as a conscientious dissent by personal commitment against the war in Vietnam.","start":425.963,"stop":435.305,"duration":9.34},{"text":"Third, both involved explicit and unqualified statutory rights at stake in both cases.","start":435.305,"stop":443.78,"duration":8.47},{"text":"Fourth, there is in neither case any discretion or exercise of judgment or weighing of evidence by the local board.","start":443.78,"stop":454.828,"duration":11.05},{"text":"Fifth, both involve the application of the delinquency regulations directly pursuant to the Hershey directive.","start":454.828,"stop":462.83,"duration":8},{"text":"Sixth, the registrants in both cases were punitively reclassified I-A pursuant to that directive.","start":462.83,"stop":471.513,"duration":8.68},{"text":"And seventh, there was a simultaneous declaration in both cases of delinquency and a I-A reclassification.","start":471.513,"stop":481.006,"duration":9.49},{"text":"Petitioner submits that the facts in Gabriel are not reconcilable with any single one of those seven factual elements in Oestereich and Breen, and for that reason, Gabriel is irrelevant to consideration of the case at bar.","start":481.006,"stop":498.703,"duration":17.7},{"text":"We submit by way of legal argument that the exemption, deferment, distinction which was drawn by the court below and on which heavy emphasis is placed by the respondents is totally unsupported in at least four aspects.","start":498.703,"stop":518.488,"duration":19.79},{"text":"The first place, unsupported by the legislative history of the statute which reflects the congressional intent in passing the Military Selective Service Act of 1967.","start":518.488,"stop":530.06,"duration":11.57},{"text":"Secondly, it is unsupported by the wording of the statute itself.","start":530.06,"stop":534.691,"duration":4.63},{"text":"Thirdly, it's unsupported by the wording of the Selective Service Regulations.","start":534.691,"stop":540.216,"duration":5.52},{"text":"And fourthly, it is unsupported by the pertinent and relevant case law by Court of Appeal’s decisions below.","start":540.216,"stop":550.913,"duration":10.7},{"text":"The legislative history of this statute is extensively described in both the House and Senate reports leading up to the passage of this Act and in particular in House Report number 267 which stresses the importance in the passage of the new Act of immunizing full time undergraduate students from any disruption of their education by way of untimely induction and stressing further the fact that this was in the public interest or this clear and unmistakable immunity to apply.","start":550.913,"stop":590.35,"duration":39.44},{"text":"There was a very distinct effort on the part of both the House and the Senate to remove local board discretion based on class standing in favor of what is described in the legislative history as a uniform deferment policy with a statutory and clear cut criteria for all undergraduate student deferments and also significant and I intend to go back to this later on.","start":590.35,"stop":618.791,"duration":28.44},{"text":"The new statute in 1967 removes the discretionary term authorize, where the President has authorized to grant student deferments and replaces it with the mandatory word ‘shall’ and further goes on to remove the further discretionary language in the old Act which talked about authorizing deferments only when necessary to the maintenance of the national health safety or interest, that was removed and what we now have in the statute are five clear cut statutory criteria leaving no discretion to the local boards whatsoever if these criteria are met.","start":618.791,"stop":662.768,"duration":43.98},{"text":"Namely, that a II-S will be granted in the following instances.","start":662.768,"stop":666.531,"duration":3.76},{"text":"First, if the student is pursuing a full time course of instruction; second, if he is attending a college, a university or a similar institution of higher learning; third, that he is pursuing a course of instruction satisfactorily; fourth, if he has not yet attained a baccalaureate degree; and fifth, if he has not attained his 24th birthday.","start":666.531,"stop":691.052,"duration":24.52},{"text":"These are the clear statutory criteria set forth by the Congress deliberately and intentionally, so that there should be no mistaking about when a student was or was not entitled to his deferment.","start":691.052,"stop":703.666,"duration":12.61},{"text":"And as far as the case at bar is concerned, there is no question.","start":703.666,"stop":707.178,"duration":3.51},{"text":"It's not contested that Mr. Breen met every single one of these criteria.","start":707.178,"stop":713.989,"duration":6.81},{"text":"The national policy and the statutory criteria are further reflected in the specific restriction upon the President which was also introduced in the 1967 statute was non-existent prior to that time, that such deferments shall not be restricted or terminated without a specific finding by the President -- that the needs of the Armed Forces require such action and of course, there has been no such finding by the President of United States.","start":713.989,"stop":747.95,"duration":33.96},{"text":"So that taking all of these elements together, it is not surprising that if the dissenting opinion below pointed out that this is about as clear a statement of congressional intent as you can get made all and more specific, all the more emphatic rather by its appearance in the Selective Service Act for the first time in the 1967 Amendments.","start":747.95,"stop":774.888,"duration":26.94},{"text":"The statute insofar as congressional intent is concerned, is further buttressed in the following way by a very brief except that I'd like to read from the conference report of the Senate and House prior to the passage of the Act and talking about these changes.","start":774.888,"stop":794.237,"duration":19.35},{"text":"This is what the report says at 1359 of the House Report number 267.","start":794.237,"stop":804.12,"duration":9.88},{"text":"The language incorporates the original House recommendation in respect to undergraduate student deferments and would provide them uniformly to all registrants who requested and qualified for such a deferment.","start":804.12,"stop":816.129,"duration":12.01},{"text":"These undergraduate deferments would continue only until a registrant had received the baccalaureate degree, failed to continue to pursue a full time course of instruction satisfactorily or reached the age of 24 whichever occurred first.","start":816.129,"stop":833.203,"duration":17.07},{"text":"I submit there's no question about the legislative intent here.","start":833.203,"stop":836.98,"duration":3.78},{"text":"Now, the other main problem of respondent's argument has to do with the proposition that an exempt registrant as in Oestereich is somehow outside the system, outside the Selective Service System entirely and it quotes, a Court of Appeal’s decision Anderson against Hershey in support of this rationale.","start":836.98,"stop":862.963,"duration":25.98},{"text":"Petitioner contends that an exempt student is no more outside the system than a deferred system -- than a deferred student.","start":862.963,"stop":871.771,"duration":8.81},{"text":"And Section 6 (k) of the statute leaves absolutely no doubt on this point as does Section 5 of the statute leave there a continuing references to deferred and exempt students.","start":871.771,"stop":882.563,"duration":10.79},{"text":"There are no distinctions drawn between exemptions and deferments with these purposes under the statute.","start":882.563,"stop":890.519,"duration":7.96},{"text":"The regulations, Section 1625.1 state unconditionally that no classification is permanent.","start":890.519,"stop":900.79,"duration":10.27},{"text":"Now, to take the Oestereich situation and compare it with the Breen situation, we can see this in operation very clearly.","start":900.79,"stop":908.724,"duration":7.93},{"text":"If Oestereich, a divinity student had finished his divinity school at the seminary and having completed his school then decided that he was going to enter a law school or he then decided that he was going to drive a bus or become a carpenter, can there be any question at all that he would not be outside the system simply because he had a IV-D originally?","start":908.724,"stop":932.086,"duration":23.36},{"text":"And let's reverse the situation.","start":932.086,"stop":934.076,"duration":1.99},{"text":"Let's take the case of the petitioner who was attending the Berklee School of Music and let's assume that having concluded the Berklee School of Music or even while he was there, he transferred to a divinity school.","start":934.076,"stop":948.319,"duration":14.24},{"text":"Would he be outside the system at that point simply because he had transferred to a divinity school?","start":948.319,"stop":952.838,"duration":4.52},{"text":"It's obvious under the statute as well as under the regulations that any change in the circumstances of a registrant can produce a change in his classification.","start":952.838,"stop":963.043,"duration":10.21},{"text":"That's what the classification, regulations are all about and that there is clearly no person who is within the system, no registrant who is within the system who simply because he has an exemption is outside the system.","start":963.043,"stop":976.81,"duration":13.77},{"text":"That was never intended and it's nowhere to be found.","start":976.81,"stop":979.663,"duration":2.85},{"text":"Indeed, it may be said, now there has been said by several courts below that both exempt and deferred registrants are outside the pool of manpower and that's true, they are outside the pool of manpower but that hardly places them outside the system.","start":979.663,"stop":999.66,"duration":20},{"text":"This is further -- I think buttressed by the fact that the exemption deferment, demarcation line which the Government tries so desperately to draw particularly after Oestereich is almost impossible to define when examining the various kinds of classifications which exist both under the statute and the regulation.","start":999.66,"stop":1021.224,"duration":21.56},{"text":"When one moves from such classification is IV-F which is an exemption and I-Y which is an exemption and then moves on I-D which is a deferment, there is no logical order of priority, there is no systematic attempt to say that we have a series of exemptions which are going to be treated in one fashion exclusively a series of deferments which are going to be treated in another fashion exclusively and at one is in a higher order of priority, one is in the lower order of priority.","start":1021.224,"stop":1050.34,"duration":29.12},{"text":"Indeed, the regulations themselves show a mixture and that mixture of exemptions and deferments in terms of persons who are in the highest order of priority at I-A down to the lowest order of priority which is I-C.","start":1050.34,"stop":1065.704,"duration":15.36},{"text":"Another, I think, prime example to illustrate this point would be in the case of federal judges who under the statute and under the regulations have deferments.","start":1065.704,"stop":1077.47,"duration":11.77},{"text":"The federal judge is obviously appointed for life but he only has a deferment.","start":1077.47,"stop":1081.597,"duration":4.13},{"text":"Now, is it going to be suggested by the Government that a federal judge is somehow rather inside the system but a divinity student at the end of a theological seminary is somehow rather outside the system, it makes no sense.","start":1081.597,"stop":1095.42,"duration":13.82},{"text":"There is no rational distinction recognized by either the statute or by the regulations and I think that the three justices of this Court who filed their dissenting opinion in Oestereich has much as said so particularly as indicated in footnote nine of their opinion.","start":1095.42,"stop":1115.102,"duration":19.68},{"text":"This was also practically conceded by counsel for Selective Service System in the brief for the Solicitor General filed in the Oestereich case calling the Court's attention particularly to the footnote on page 68 where again, there was practically a concession that you couldn't draw these fine distinctions.","start":1115.102,"stop":1135.971,"duration":20.87}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"In your brief, I think you state that the Vice President of the United States

some line in this case as in so many other cases before this Court that needs to be drawn is not between exemptions on the one hand and deferments on the other but rather between those exemptions and

where you have exemptions and deferments there and those exemptions and deferments which are granted by statute but which are subject to findings of fact, which are subject to exercise of judgment by local boards and weighing of evidence where again you got exemptions and deferments such as in the case of IV-F's, in the case of conscientious objectors, in the case of dependency and hardship deferments.","start":1175.6,"stop":1231.992,"duration":56.39},{"text":"As a matter of fact, we would submit that the Gabriel case itself is a prime example to illustrate this point where you are

for a weighing, for a judgment, for discretionary act by the local board which may indeed be barred by 10 (b) (3) but certainly where there are criteria totally irrelevant to the statutory criteria such as in the case at bar where the only basis for doing what the board did and this is conceded as the turning over of a registration certificate to a clergymen by way of an expression of dissent that has nothing to do with the statute and at that point the Selective Service director cannot do anything about taking away a II-S classification, I would submit.","start":1279.45,"stop":1337.336,"duration":57.89},{"text":"The only final point that I would like to make, so I can reserve a little time later on if the Court please is that the case is cited by the Government that three Court of Appeals cases cited by Government, give it small comfort in attempting to arrange for what is obviously a divorce of convenience as between the exemption on the one side and deferment on the other.","start":1337.336,"stop":1362.286,"duration":24.95},{"text":"The Kolden case which it cites by dictum is in full accord with the position of the petitioner in
