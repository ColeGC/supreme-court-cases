please the Court?","start":16.346,"stop":18.561,"duration":2.22},{"text":"The issues in this case, arise out of the stated refusal of petitioner Mulloys Selective Service Board to reopen his classification and consider his claim for conscientious objector status.","start":18.561,"stop":34.965,"duration":16.4},{"text":"That's what we are dealing with here, a failure to reopen.","start":34.965,"stop":38.873,"duration":3.91},{"text":"We do not have the case where the board has decided to claim, at least officially, on the merits and where there has been an appeal, or at least, an opportunity for an appeal, so that the question before this Court would be whether there was a basis in fact for the determination.","start":38.873,"stop":57.259,"duration":18.39},{"text":"The issue is not whether the petitioner was a conscientious objector or whether there was a basis in fact for a substantive determination that he was not.","start":57.259,"stop":67.922,"duration":10.66},{"text":"The issue is purely a procedural one.","start":67.922,"stop":71.211,"duration":3.29},{"text":"Did the petitioner make enough of a showing of entitlement to classification as a conscientious objector that he was entitled to an appealable determination by the board?","start":71.211,"stop":84.778,"duration":13.57},{"text":"I guess what this case is all about is that the petitioner claims, he was entitled to a full-scale determination including the right of appeal.","start":84.778,"stop":94.855,"duration":10.08},{"text":"The board summarily dismissed.","start":94.855,"stop":98.29,"duration":3.44},{"text":"The first issue then revolves around the summary dismissal.","start":98.29,"stop":102.899,"duration":4.61},{"text":"The petitioner is contended throughout these proceedings that the board either was required to reopen because based on his SSS Form 150 and the letters and other information submitted in support of a claim, he made out a prima facie case of entitlement or, that what really happened was that the board in fact reopened deciding the claim against him on the merits but denying him the appeal to which he was entitled by the regulations.","start":102.899,"stop":133.363,"duration":30.46},{"text":"In this Court, the Government now concedes which is a clear departure from its position here before that based on the SSS Form 150 and the supporting letters, the petitioner made out a prima facie case of entitlement but says the Government, even so, the board does not have to reopen.","start":133.363,"stop":153.094,"duration":19.73},{"text":"I think issue was joined on that first point.","start":153.094,"stop":155.864,"duration":2.77},{"text":"The second issue --","start":155.864,"stop":156.71,"duration":0.85}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you think

Honor.","start":164.369,"stop":165.279,"duration":0.91},{"text":"This is a point that we have made and that the board did not say why it found that he wasn't a conscientious objector.B","start":165.279,"stop":175.45,"duration":10.17},{"text":"ut the record does clearly say what the board did.","start":175.45,"stop":179.682,"duration":4.23},{"text":"The Form 100, the phase form, falling the November 9th meeting, says, “Classification not reopened”.","start":179.682,"stop":190.747,"duration":11.07},{"text":"Now, following the meeting on January 11th, the SSS Form 100 reads all information in the file considered including claim of conscientious objector.","start":190.747,"stop":204.542,"duration":13.79},{"text":"The board felt that information did not warrant reopening of 1-A classification vote four to nothing.","start":204.542,"stop":212.385,"duration":7.84},{"text":"This was also brought out at the testimony both in the civil trial and the criminal trial where Chairman Sherman stated, “That taking everything in the file.”","start":212.385,"stop":224.266,"duration":11.88},{"text":"Assuming what he said to be true, he did not make out a case and we saw no reason to reopen because it wasn't there.","start":224.266,"stop":231.898,"duration":7.63},{"text":"I think it is very clear that the board's reason for its action was that the petitioner did not make out a prima facie case for entitlement.","start":231.898,"stop":241.21,"duration":9.31},{"text":"This was the Government's argument both in the District Court and before the Court of Appeals.","start":241.21,"stop":247.017,"duration":5.81},{"text":"The Court of Appeals explicitly stated that, petitioner did not make out a prima facie case and therefore the board was not required to reopen.","start":247.017,"stop":257.119,"duration":10.1},{"text":"Now, we have contended all along, that the only way you could say, he did not make out a prima facie case is to totally distort the meaning of prima facie case, and say that prima facie case means the same thing as a merits determination.","start":257.119,"stop":271.498,"duration":14.38},{"text":"I think that's the point that stands out most clearly in this case, that there was nothing more that the board could have done.","start":271.498,"stop":279.443,"duration":7.94},{"text":"No further information that it could've considered if it had in fact reopened the classification.","start":279.443,"stop":285.92,"duration":6.48},{"text":"Now, what it did was to say, “We don't think he is a conscientious objector.”","start":285.92,"stop":291.476,"duration":5.56},{"text":"Now, the board can say that but under the regulations, this constitutes a reopening in fact, entitling the registrant to an administrative appeal under Section 1625.13.","start":291.476,"stop":305.018,"duration":13.54},{"text":"The second issue and this isn't a way related to the first, is simply that he was denied due process because the board did not give them a full and fair hearing.","start":305.018,"stop":315.756,"duration":10.74},{"text":"They didn’t read the file.","start":315.756,"stop":318.795,"duration":3.04},{"text":"They, at best, walked through it, scanning it before making a determination that he didn’t state a prima facie case.","start":318.795,"stop":327.543,"duration":8.75},{"text":"They're simply would not have been timed at the so-called courtesy hearing for the three members who were present to even scan, let alone read the detailed answers to SSS Form 150, let alone all the other information in the form.","start":327.543,"stop":343.241,"duration":15.7}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

was the newest member of the board and I wasn't familiar with what was in the file at all.”","start":385.391,"stop":393.75,"duration":8.36},{"text":"Mr. Wolfgang said that, “He read it but he couldn't

file.","start":399.697,"stop":405.163,"duration":5.47},{"text":"We've also contended as part of the same denial of the full and fair hearing that the demonstrable incompetence of the draft board members was a denial of due process.","start":405.163,"stop":417.794,"duration":12.63},{"text":"They simply did not understand what a conscientious objector was.","start":417.794,"stop":422.871,"duration":5.08},{"text":"The clerk testified that in her 17 years with the board, no one had ever been assigned to civilian work as a conscientious objector.","start":422.871,"stop":432.259,"duration":9.39},{"text":"Mr. Sherman, the chairman of the board thought that a conscientious objector was one who was opposed to the use of violence which of course is not the statutory definition.","start":432.259,"stop":442.202,"duration":9.94},{"text":"Mr. Downs didn't seem to realize that the board had the power to determine whether a man was a conscientious objector.","start":442.202,"stop":451.202,"duration":9},{"text":"Mr. Walking seem to think that by applying for conscientious objector status, the member stay -- the registrant stated that he would not do alternative civilian service.","start":451.202,"stop":462.63,"duration":11.43},{"text":"Now, I think this is the factual situation that we are dealing with.","start":462.63,"stop":466.989,"duration":4.36},{"text":"The Government says that the board must have assumed that the petitioner was not sincere.","start":466.989,"stop":473.383,"duration":6.39},{"text":"Otherwise, it would have been inexplicable that they didn't reopen.","start":473.383,"stop":477.216,"duration":3.83},{"text":"I would suggest that there may be another reason that they never read the file and if they had read the file, it wouldn't have made any difference because they had no understanding of what a conscientious
