inclusion report of the Commission, which I will have occasionally, refer to was before the Court at the time it decided the Penn-Central Merger case.","start":112.272,"stop":132.617,"duration":20.34},{"text":"The New Haven filed a petition for reorganization in the Connecticut District Court in 1961 and that reorganization has continued since.","start":132.617,"stop":146.381,"duration":13.76},{"text":"Judge Robert Anderson was in charge of the reorganization from the beginning and continued to be after his appointment to the Court of Appeals.","start":146.381,"stop":156.475,"duration":10.09},{"text":"It was -- and is a somewhat unusual type of reorganization from the very beginning because the Railroad had been running deficit since at least 1956.","start":156.475,"stop":168.788,"duration":12.31},{"text":"It was apparent that the only way to keep the Railroad running was to have some kind of a merger or sale to another railroad in existence.","start":168.788,"stop":181.163,"duration":12.38},{"text":"And during the time of reorganization, that is from 1961 down through the 1968 at which time the Penn Central took over the New Haven and paid over the considerations subject to review of the problem of price.","start":181.163,"stop":200.865,"duration":19.7},{"text":"The reorganization had accumulated some $65 million of charges and claims ahead of the bonds as a result of reorganization expenses and borrowings and so on.","start":200.865,"stop":215.368,"duration":14.5},{"text":"This process continued, I think there is no dispute because of the determination on the part of a judge and the trustees and the trustees’ counsel and the Commission to keep the Railroad running and a proper feeling on the part of Judge Anderson and the others that New England required the continuation of this Railroad.","start":215.368,"stop":240.826,"duration":25.46},{"text":"I think Your Honors are familiar enough with its physical circumstances, so that help me to go into those that runs from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York and these both are a railroad which takes commuter traffic and interstate traffic of a more general in character.","start":240.826,"stop":260.687,"duration":19.86},{"text":"It's clear I think that from the very beginning, the trustees were seeking to find a railroad with which there might be a merger of the New Haven or an acquisition of the New Haven and that from the very beginning while this search went on, there was no prospect that the road could have been abandoned or liquidated because of the concern of everyone to keep it running.","start":260.687,"stop":292.629,"duration":31.94},{"text":"In 1961, the trustees approached the Pennsylvania and the New York Central on behalf of New Haven to see if they were interested in some acquisition and in 1962, they reported that the only salvation for this Railroad was some kind of a merger or acquisition.","start":292.629,"stop":314.743,"duration":22.11},{"text":"And in the same month, March 1962, the Pennsylvania and the Central asked approval of their merger under Section 52 of the Commission.","start":314.743,"stop":324.058,"duration":9.31},{"text":"In June 1962, the trustees intervened in the merger case to seek inclusion.","start":324.058,"stop":331.35,"duration":7.29},{"text":"There were negotiations in 1964 between Penn Central and the trustees which were unknown to the bondholders and which ultimately resulted in an agreement which was disposed for the first time in a report of a Commission Examiner, an agreement under which the merged corporation would acquire the New Haven assets for certain specified considerations.","start":331.35,"stop":362.555,"duration":31.2},{"text":"The Commission approved the merger and required Penn Central to include both passenger and freight operations and said in its order, “All upon such fair and equitable term as the parties may agree subject to the approval of a Bankruptcy Court and the Commission.”","start":362.555,"stop":380.849,"duration":18.29},{"text":"In October 1966, the trustees and Penn Central filed their agreed purchase agreement as a first step in the plan of reorganization.","start":380.849,"stop":392.02,"duration":11.17},{"text":"Hearings before an Examiner followed, report was dispensed with and the matter was submitted directly to the Commission.","start":392.02,"stop":400.362,"duration":8.34},{"text":"For some intermediate proceedings and in which arrangements were made for loans to the New Haven and other matters, but I don’t see if they’re relevant to what we are concerned with here and the were cited in the brief and I won’t take time to talk about.","start":400.362,"stop":415.688,"duration":15.33},{"text":"There followed the inclusion report of November 1967, which is the report which was before this Court at the time of the Penn-Central Merger, at least this Court knew about it.","start":415.688,"stop":428.602,"duration":12.91},{"text":"That report led to the first round of these appellants’ successful applications to the courts below, and both courts below remanded to the Commission.","start":428.602,"stop":443.101,"duration":14.5},{"text":"The essence of that inclusion report as far as the New Haven is concerned is that using evaluation as the evaluation date, December 31, 1966, the Commission found net liquidation value of the New Haven assets was a $128.9 million, which had rounded to a $125 million.","start":443.101,"stop":468.207,"duration":25.11},{"text":"It found the fair value of the consideration to be paid by the Penn Central under the purchase agreement was a $123.6 million which had rounded to a $125 million so that the consideration and the value of the liquidation value were similar and because of that, equality which it saw in the transaction had held that the transaction met statutory standards and approved it by the appellant.","start":468.207,"stop":502.191,"duration":33.98},{"text":"The present appellants petitioned for review and the three-judge court was convened consisting of Judge Friendly and Judge Levet, and Judge Weinfeld from the southern district.","start":502.191,"stop":515.706,"duration":13.52},{"text":"By order of May 1968, the court disapproved the inclusion report on the ground that it appeared that the Penn Central should pay an additional sum of $45 to $50 million.","start":515.706,"stop":532.895,"duration":17.19},{"text":"I don't think there's any use in going into the items there, they are set forth in our brief on page 15 from Judge Winfield's later dissenting opinion.","start":532.895,"stop":541.604,"duration":8.71},{"text":"While the matter was pending before the three-judge court, the Commission submitted the purchase agreement to the reorganization court as step one in the plan of reorganization.","start":541.604,"stop":556.285,"duration":14.68},{"text":"In April 1968, the court appointed a former judge of the Court of Appeals in New York Judge John Van Voorhis has a special master that considered the problems that are arising out of the Grand Central Terminal property.","start":556.285,"stop":572.126,"duration":15.84},{"text":"We don't say a word about that although Mr. Migdal is going to carry the argument on the point on the matter that it’s still open.","start":572.126,"stop":580.978,"duration":8.85},{"text":"Just after the turn of the century, the railroads using Grand Central Terminal came down a great open ditch, which is now Park Avenue and that seemed to kind of a waste of a valuable property.","start":580.978,"stop":595.842,"duration":14.86},{"text":"And in the early part of the century it was bridged over to create Park Avenue, and as a result of that and the agreements between the Central and the New Haven, a number of the principal hotels at which we have all to few left were built the Waldorf, the Biltmore, the Commodore, the Roosevelt, the Pan-Am building is older than the Yale Club.","start":595.842,"stop":621.433,"duration":25.59},{"text":"The New Haven and Penn Central -- the Central had a sort of a partnership interest in these properties and there was dispute about the nature of that interest and its value.","start":621.433,"stop":637.501,"duration":16.07},{"text":"The Commission in its inclusion report stuck a balance between various possibilities and arrive at a figure of $13 million as the figure that should be allowed, but that was evidently too low and Judge Van Voorhis was asked to report his views about the legal relationships.","start":637.501,"stop":657.093,"duration":19.59},{"text":"And he upheld the view that there was a partnership interest in connection with the Grand Central properties and ultimately as I will show Your Honors in the remand report the original loss of $13 million was advanced to $28 million so that under the present position of the Commission, the New Haven is entitled to $28 million for its interest.","start":657.093,"stop":686.086,"duration":28.99},{"text":"There is no dispute that the value of the property is $227 million so that the Penn Central has acquired a very valuable property for a very small amount.","start":686.086,"stop":698.511,"duration":12.42}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Was Judge Van Voorhis appointed the special master for the

in New York.","start":720.568,"stop":726.716,"duration":6.15},{"text":"The reorganization court like the three-judge court concluded that the allowance by the Commission was inadequate that the undervalued property and he too remanded to the Commission.","start":726.716,"stop":745.054,"duration":18.34},{"text":"The three-judge court thought that the amount the Commission should increase its determination value was $45-50 million.","start":745.054,"stop":754.509,"duration":9.46},{"text":"Judge Van Voorhis spread was a little wider.","start":754.509,"stop":756.778,"duration":2.27},{"text":"He thought it should be $33-55 million.","start":756.778,"stop":761.2,"duration":4.42},{"text":"Judge Anderson, I beg your pardon, Judge Anderson.","start":761.2,"stop":765.58,"duration":4.38},{"text":"The Commission proceeded the whole expedited hearings and made its remand report on November 25, 1968 and this is the one which these appellants attacked here, and so I will be talking about some phases of that a little later on.","start":765.58,"stop":789.945,"duration":24.37},{"text":"The Commission was sustained on some matters by the courts later on.","start":789.945,"stop":797.937,"duration":7.99},{"text":"I don't think I need to take any time on that.","start":797.937,"stop":799.718,"duration":1.78},{"text":"So what we are going to talk about on our side are those things where the Commission was sustained by division among the judges and those things where the Commission was not sustained -- or was sustained but we think the court was wrong in sustaining it.","start":799.718,"stop":818.413,"duration":18.7},{"text":"The effect of the decision on remand was starting with the liquidation value of a $125 million, which the court had found for a $128 million -- 128.9, which the Commission had found on its origin inclusion order and increasing that to a $162.7 million and then immediately retreated by a series of deductions, major deductions from that amount.","start":818.413,"stop":854.008,"duration":35.6},{"text":"The most significant and those to which I am going to address myself being to totaling $22 million.","start":854.008,"stop":862.564,"duration":8.56},{"text":"One is so called discount for a abandonment delay and the other discount for -- so called discount for bulk sale.","start":862.564,"stop":873.386,"duration":10.82},{"text":"And in both this cases, our position is that Judge Anderson and Judge Winfield who dissented below were correct in their view that this discounts were unjustified and that Judge Friendly and Judge Levet were wrong in concluding that they could be justified.","start":873.386,"stop":896.972,"duration":23.59},{"text":"And so we shall ask Your Honors to follow the reorganization court on these matters.","start":896.972,"stop":902.382,"duration":5.41},{"text":"Our order to about what they were.","start":902.382,"stop":906.034,"duration":3.65},{"text":"The first discount, the abandonment delay discount or as in the substantial figure of $15,386,000.00 and this was based upon the theory that beginning in 1967, the New Haven would have had to start abandonment proceeding that that would have taken a year.","start":906.034,"stop":935.547,"duration":29.51},{"text":"That in that year, the New Haven would have had been practically as it stand still and although the losses for that year were already charged against the New Haven that the Commission could properly charge it again for up to an additional sum of $15, 386,000.00 and the bulk sale discount was a discount of about $6 million.","start":935.547,"stop":966.67,"duration":31.12},{"text":"The Commission held that it could require that the New Haven's properties be sold in bulk at a discount because it had the power to condition the abandonment certificate on a sale in bulk.","start":966.67,"stop":984.973,"duration":18.3},{"text":"This abandonment certificate which have had thought would have to be sought, which was never sought and never could have been obtained could be condition on this bulk sale discount.","start":984.973,"stop":995.9,"duration":10.93},{"text":"And that was the theory on which the Commission went.","start":995.9,"stop":1000.776,"duration":4.88},{"text":"They made a few adjustments upward in their remand report, including an addition of sum on the Grand Central Terminal, which I have already referred to.","start":1000.776,"stop":1010.54,"duration":9.76},{"text":"But the net result of their whole operation of finding liquidation value of a $132 million and then making this large deductions was to arrive at a figure of $140.6 million to which it added $5 million additional arriving at a total figure of $145.6 million and then it proceeded to find that the consideration for that, which was largely in stock was worth that amount and therefore it would approve the acquisition at that price.","start":1010.54,"stop":1044.354,"duration":33.81},{"text":"Now taking the figure of that the Commission arrived at that I've just mentioned just so you have a kind of a guide to what it did.","start":1044.354,"stop":1055.131,"duration":10.78},{"text":"Taking the price of Penn Central stock, it brought in the consideration in December 1968 which is the date of the Commission’s remand report, the first mortgage bondholders would have received 24 cents on the capital on a dollar, 18 cents on a dollar if interest is included.","start":1055.131,"stop":1081.379,"duration":26.25},{"text":"You will see at once of course that the expectations of the reviewing courts, the three-judge court that $45-50 million would be added and the reorganization court that $33-55 million would be added as a result of the reconsideration fell far short of achievement.","start":1081.379,"stop":1103.812,"duration":22.43},{"text":"Judge Anderson when the prompt of the remand report came before him approved the immediate transfer of the property, two of the New Haven, two of the Penn Central so that the property would be required before the end of the year having previously ruled that unless there was transaction before the end of the year, the New Haven trans would stop running on January 1, 1969 because the erosion would then gone beyond any possible constitutional limit.","start":1103.812,"stop":1139.201,"duration":35.39},{"text":"And so the transfer took place and from that time on -- remember this was before Your Honors, there was an effort to stop the transfer and the courts below denied a stay and so the transfer proceeded leaving the question of price opened.","start":1139.201,"stop":1155.526,"duration":16.33},{"text":"Now the state of the conflict between the courts below is that as to this abandonment delay discount, Judge Anderson and Judge Winfield thought it was entirely unjustified that it was illegal and erroneous and was not sustained by substantial evidence, Judge Friendly and Judge Levet and the three-judge court affirmed, submitted on the phase of there opinion somewhat reluctantly concluding that it was -- I could not say it was sustained by substantial evidence and they could not say it was irrational, but they did sustain it.","start":1155.526,"stop":1195.766,"duration":40.24}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Judge Anderson think can precede the three-judge court opinion?","start":1195.766,"stop":1201.106,"duration":5.34}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":1201.106,"stop":1201.865,"duration":0.76}]},{"speakerName":"Potter

weeks.","start":1204.464,"stop":1208.49,"duration":4.03},{"text":"So it was before the three-judge court.","start":1208.49,"stop":1215.352,"duration":6.86},{"text":"The division between the courts is the same on bulk sale, the same on the Harlem River and Oak Point yards, which Mr. Migdal is going to talk about and then on the certain adjustments.","start":1215.352,"stop":1229.622,"duration":14.27},{"text":"And then there were some matters on which the courts both disagreed with the position of the appellants here and we are going to present some of those points on argument and some on brief.","start":1229.622,"stop":1243.407,"duration":13.78},{"text":"Mr. Migdal will present following my argument the matter of the Harlem River yards and the matter of the questions on the Grand Central Terminal and on the valuation of the stock.","start":1243.407,"stop":1262.128,"duration":18.72},{"text":"And then we will submit some of the points on briefs because there obviously isn't time to cover all these points.","start":1262.128,"stop":1276.278,"duration":14.15},{"text":"We submit that Judge Anderson and Judge Winfield were clearly right that the abandonment delay was as Judge Anderson said, drag in by the heels for the purpose of reducing the liquidation value that which both courts had formerly held the bondholders were entitled and there isn't any real dispute here that liquidation value is the proper standing.","start":1276.278,"stop":1309.376,"duration":33.1},{"text":"The deduction of $16 million from liquidation value was found by the Commission was more than a departure in the interest of flexibility or as the Commission said a matter of refinement or a matter of pricing out.","start":1309.376,"stop":1327.434,"duration":18.06},{"text":"It really subverted the whole concept of using liquidation value as the standard and there was no justification for it.","start":1327.434,"stop":1339.239,"duration":11.81},{"text":"From the beginning it was perfectly clear that no application to abandon and liquidate would be granted.","start":1339.239,"stop":1348.879,"duration":9.64},{"text":"The three-judge court thought that was clear, the Commission thought that was clear and it's perfectly evident from the whole

amount the Penn Central had to pay for this property seems to us most unjust and inequitable as Judge Anderson and Judge Winfield viewed it.","start":1371.831,"stop":1383.324,"duration":11.49},{"text":"And I submit that that decision should be reversed.","start":1383.324,"stop":1387.636,"duration":4.31},{"text":"Other details of that,
