they have in applying the tax benefit rule realistically.","start":3038.85,"stop":3047.497,"duration":8.65},{"text":"They set forth the rule but they don’t apply certainly in the taxable exchange area when there's a cash sale of accounts receivable.","start":3047.497,"stop":3057.673,"duration":10.18},{"text":"The rule as set forth in their brief says you restore to income a deduction when you recover it.","start":3057.673,"stop":3065.407,"duration":7.73},{"text":"Well, If you have a sale for the receivables at gross, that’s a recovery and it would come in income.","start":3065.407,"stop":3071.491,"duration":6.08},{"text":"If you have a sale at net, the most logical conclusion seems to me is that you have no recovery under the tax benefit rule and therefore there’s no income to the taxpayer selling in a taxable transaction.","start":3071.491,"stop":3084.076,"duration":12.59},{"text":"The Government in order to bend the rule to fit our tax free situation sets up a hypothesis that they have a loss realized on the receivables which counteracts the return to income of the reserve and the wash result is a net of zero.","start":3084.076,"stop":3104.06,"duration":19.98},{"text":"We say that's an incorrect approach to the problem.","start":3104.06,"stop":3107.574,"duration":3.51},{"text":"The loss occurred when

that, that there is a different rule to apply in Section 337 liquidations.","start":3133.764,"stop":3143.98,"duration":10.22},{"text":"We don't -- I did not cover that because it’s covered in my brief

the reserve comes back into income.","start":3168.356,"stop":3171.259,"duration":2.9},{"text":"Well, that seems to be the tax benefit rule in its proper application and I've set out that entire

there is no recognition of income to the partners.","start":3189.103,"stop":3201.292,"duration":12.19},{"text":"I would just focus our attention if I will on the question, the Government has assumed as we said that there is a problem of a double deduction.","start":3201.292,"stop":3212.37,"duration":11.08},{"text":"We maintain that there is no problem of a double deduction because there has been no, in our case, no one has tried to take a second deduction and in no case discussed today or in any of the brief has any taxpayer attempted to take a second deduction at any stage.","start":3212.37,"stop":3231.993,"duration":19.62},{"text":"So that the basis hypothesis for the need for the revenue ruling it seems to me unfounded that there is not second deduction to guard against and therefore, without that problem, there’s no need to even travel under 7805 but under that Section, the solution if we were to assume for argument there’s a problem.","start":3231.993,"stop":3251.839,"duration":19.85},{"text":"Under that Section, the solution has to be consistent with the statute.","start":3251.839,"stop":3255.848,"duration":4.01},{"text":"We say that Section 351 which says no gain or loss if property is transferred, if, it doesn’t say from property, it’s not tied to the property.","start":3255.848,"stop":3265.752,"duration":9.9},{"text":"It says if property is transferred, that the legislative history of that Section points out that that’s not a taxable event,

income.","start":3265.752,"stop":3286.619,"duration":20.87},{"text":"So we say there is no magic in saying what we have over here is income and the statute said no gain, loss or income because in 1924, they used the two terms interchangeably.","start":3286.619,"stop":3302.22,"duration":15.6},{"text":"Certainly, the cure to the illness should not be worse than the illness itself and that’s
