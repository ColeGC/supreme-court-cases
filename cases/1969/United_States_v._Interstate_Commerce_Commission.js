Pacific.","start":125.553,"stop":132.432,"duration":6.88},{"text":"I think that has to be said.","start":132.432,"stop":136.216,"duration":3.78},{"text":"This went on until 1960, that kind and I think this is rather significant, the banking advisers of Northern Pacific, Morgan Stanley suggested the compromise was finally adopted which the exchange ratio that the parties agreed to.","start":136.216,"stop":155.382,"duration":19.17},{"text":"Now, that was described yesterday.","start":155.382,"stop":158.011,"duration":2.63},{"text":"I merely would like to say this about the ratio.","start":158.011,"stop":161.259,"duration":3.25},{"text":"The reasoning that underlies it is that it gives the shareholders of Northern Pacific in the long term and equal share in the equity of this new company.","start":161.259,"stop":177.213,"duration":15.95},{"text":"But at the same time it gives an immediate but not a lasting recognition through this preferred stock to the historical fact that the earnings and dividends of the Great Northern had been greater than the exchange ratio was established.","start":177.213,"stop":197.12,"duration":19.91},{"text":"Now this compromise proposed by Morgan Stanley was approved by both investment banking houses by the board of directors of each company and it was twice approved by the stockholders of Northern Pacific.","start":197.12,"stop":211.561,"duration":14.44},{"text":"Once in 1961 and once last year in 1968, and each occasion it was approved by 73% of stockholders, the first time are about 6% of the stockholders who voted against it, the second time about 2% of the stockholders who voted against it.","start":211.561,"stop":233.784,"duration":22.22},{"text":"I think it must be said about the 2% to decline in that vote.","start":233.784,"stop":238.902,"duration":5.12},{"text":"But the Committee conducted a proxy fight and that they did ask that those who favored their point of view not vote as well as vote against.","start":238.902,"stop":250.84,"duration":11.94},{"text":"So that no doubt that the part accounted for they declined in the vote.","start":250.84,"stop":255.997,"duration":5.16},{"text":"But the Committee in the proxy fight presented all the arguments that they have presented here.","start":255.997,"stop":261.545,"duration":5.55},{"text":"Now the Commission and the Trial Examiner both bound that this ratio was just and reasonable.","start":261.545,"stop":270.085,"duration":8.54},{"text":"The Commission found that it fairly represented the contribution that each group or shareholders has made to the new enterprise.","start":270.085,"stop":279.115,"duration":9.03},{"text":"I emphasize that fact because I think the impression might have been left for the Court yesterday that Commission based its approval of the ratio solely on the finding that there was arm’s length bargaining.","start":279.115,"stop":291.137,"duration":12.02},{"text":"Well, it did find that there have been arm’s length bargaining but it also made this finding on the fair contribution to the -- to the new company by each group of shareholders.","start":291.137,"stop":302.803,"duration":11.67},{"text":"The findings that were made by the Commission on fairness to ratio, we submit are supported by substantial evidence.","start":302.803,"stop":315.152,"duration":12.35},{"text":"There was a great deal of evidence to the -- that supported the Commission’s finding that this ratio fairly represented the contribution made by each group of shareholders.","start":315.152,"stop":326.939,"duration":11.79},{"text":"The ratio was based by -- and it got finally on an appraisal of earnings both on appraisal of the past earnings to which there was evidence before the parties and which was before the Commission, and a judgment about the earnings in the future including the earnings of the natural resources properties.","start":326.939,"stop":348.511,"duration":21.57},{"text":"The parties didn’t use any arithmetical formula but they reached a judgment about that and established the exchange ratio accordingly.","start":348.511,"stop":357.009,"duration":8.5},{"text":"Now, the Committee seems to make really two points about the evidences complaining the fact that the ratio wasn’t based on asset appraisal of the market value of these properties.","start":357.009,"stop":374.194,"duration":17.19},{"text":"They suggested there was really no evidence about that before the Commission, but I think that is not quite a complete count of what did happen.","start":374.194,"stop":383.633,"duration":9.44},{"text":"There was each of the railroads here got independent as said appraisals from independent firms are the more important to these properties.","start":383.633,"stop":393.004,"duration":9.37},{"text":"And then their direct testimony before the Commission, the executive of the railroad applicants testified about these appraisals and explained why they didn’t use them in establishing the exchange ratio.","start":393.004,"stop":408.415,"duration":15.41},{"text":"The Committee asked the appraisals and they were produced and the Committee put them an evidence before the Commission.","start":408.415,"stop":413.557,"duration":5.14},{"text":"So the Commission had some evidence, had the evidence about the asset appraisals and also testimony about why they weren’t used.","start":413.557,"stop":422.531,"duration":8.97},{"text":"They weren’t used because they were in parties’ judgment they were not as reliable earnings, there were enormous differences between them, and even the independent firms who made them in some instances said they weren’t sure that they reflected market value.","start":422.531,"stop":438.443,"duration":15.91},{"text":"The Committee also complains that not enough weight was given to the earnings of the natural resource properties of the Northern Pacific.","start":438.443,"stop":448.672,"duration":10.23},{"text":"It says they should’ve been valued at 50 times earnings or perhaps to 22-1/2 times earnings.","start":448.672,"stop":455.413,"duration":6.74},{"text":"But I submit there is nothing in the record that required the Commission to accept those particular arithmetical formulas as a standard for judging the legality of this exchange ratio.","start":455.413,"stop":469.073,"duration":13.66},{"text":"The 50 times earnings at the time is testified to would have produced a value for the natural resources property of the Northern Pacific alone, which was $90 million than the -- higher than the total stock market value of the entire enterprise including the railroad properties.","start":469.073,"stop":490.612,"duration":21.54},{"text":"It would have produced evaluation that was $280 million more than the amount to the Committee proposed that these properties be sold for in connection with the divestiture proposal of the Committee put before the Commission, so that the formula really didn’t come within any measurable distance of reality.","start":490.612,"stop":509.486,"duration":18.87},{"text":"The 22-1/2 times formula if it applied to the five years before 1960 when the exchange ratio was determined produces an exchange ratio that a little less favorable to the Northern Pacific stockholders than they want -- than the ratio they actually received.","start":509.486,"stop":529.414,"duration":19.93},{"text":"That’s true if you applied in some more recent years.","start":529.414,"stop":532.41,"duration":3},{"text":"Now, the Committee can apply up to certain years and get the results that they say show that the ratio was unfair and these computations are in our brief -- in their brief.","start":532.41,"stop":544.08,"duration":11.67},{"text":"I'm inclined to think that what they show is that with one of these arithmetical formulas, you can get different results to apply them to different years.","start":544.08,"stop":552.728,"duration":8.65},{"text":"But the fact is that there was substantial evidence before the Commission about all the matters, to parties considered in relation to earnings, the various things that affected earnings past and what would might affect them in the future to indicate that this exchange ratio had a substantial basis and that evidence was all before the Commission and they discussed in detail were about 28 pages and Examiner’s report about 11 pages and the Commission’s report that sets out this evidence.","start":552.728,"stop":586.796,"duration":34.07},{"text":"Now, what I have said about the finding as to the fairness, the contribution that each group of shareholders made to the company.","start":586.796,"stop":596.343,"duration":9.55},{"text":"I think could also be said about the finding that there was arm’s length bargaining.","start":596.343,"stop":602.061,"duration":5.72},{"text":"Both the examiner and the Commission made that finding and the examiner made it after hearing testimony from the executives who participated in these negotiations and from the representatives of the banking house which participated and advised the two companies.","start":602.061,"stop":626.731,"duration":24.67},{"text":"I think that I understand what the -- that is the point of view is, I think they believe, no doubt sincerely that the Commission they have given too much weight to some evidence and not enough weight to another -- other or that perhaps for variant inferences to the inferences that the examiner and the Commission drew from the evidence.","start":626.731,"stop":652.264,"duration":25.53},{"text":"But, I think it cannot be said really that these findings lack support and substantial evidence in the record.","start":652.264,"stop":663.504,"duration":11.24},{"text":"Now, the Committee makes another contention which was referred to briefly yesterday and that is that the Commission abused its discretion in 1968 when it didn’t reopen this record and that retry the issue of the fairness to the exchange ratio.","start":663.504,"stop":679.08,"duration":15.58},{"text":"We have discussed that point in our brief and replied to the showings that they have made was to change conditions with the analysis to those conditions which we submit that shows that the matters on which they rely do not really support the argument that the Commission abused its discretion.","start":679.08,"stop":703.615,"duration":24.53},{"text":"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.","start":703.615,"stop":704.592,"duration":0.98}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

merger.","start":846.268,"stop":852.299,"duration":6.03},{"text":"The second thing goes many added benefits that we get from a new and revitalized Milwaukee Railroad.","start":852.299,"stop":858.936,"duration":6.64},{"text":"The third thing is the vast amount of competitive traffic that will be available to us to protect us after the merger is accomplished.","start":858.936,"stop":871.888,"duration":12.95},{"text":"Fourth, the tremendous number of safeguards that the Interstate Commerce Commission has built-in to the order that’s before this Court today to protect us from great discrimination and service discriminations.","start":871.888,"stop":885.305,"duration":13.42},{"text":"Some really wonderful safeguards and lastly, the $40

involved.","start":885.305,"stop":902.669,"duration":17.36},{"text":"Now coming specifically, are the shippers that I represent here today are they the pawns of the railroad, are we the ones swayed by

Railroad.","start":932.587,"stop":938.293,"duration":5.71},{"text":"There had to be a merger, but there had to be conditions and we fought valuably for something over 10 years even before the official filing to accomplish this end result that’s before the Court today.","start":938.293,"stop":951.449,"duration":13.16},{"text":"Now, the shippers are uniquely situated to judge the effectiveness.","start":951.449,"stop":957.918,"duration":6.47},{"text":"Our people in over 50,000 car loads of freight are aggregated in the shippers for whom I speak here

operation here.","start":1048.101,"stop":1063.417,"duration":15.32},{"text":"But more importantly on the dependability is the fact that they will be using vastly shorter routes to and from the key market.","start":1063.417,"stop":1072.42,"duration":9},{"text":"For example, the record shows right now that 15 million car miles a day will be -- or car miles a year will be saved by the new short routes that will utilized by this merge line in the operation after merger is accomplished.","start":1072.42,"stop":1090.318,"duration":17.9},{"text":"They’ll do that by running more traffic through the Laurel-Billings area that now goes through Missouri River Gateways.","start":1090.318,"stop":1098.058,"duration":7.74},{"text":"They’ll do it by using the best and the shortest parts of the

routings.","start":1105.53,"stop":1111.321,"duration":5.79},{"text":"Now, the third great thing is the improved transit privileges.","start":1111.321,"stop":1115.364,"duration":4.04},{"text":"Unfortunately, in the west we raise strawberries in one area, beans in another area, and we must put those together to get the

want.","start":1125.756,"stop":1131.544,"duration":5.79},{"text":"They don’t want a straight car load of strawberries or beans, they want a mix.","start":1131.544,"stop":1136.112,"duration":4.57},{"text":"We can start at one point and complete on another.","start":1136.112,"stop":1139.586,"duration":3.47},{"text":"At the present time, we

the transit privileges.","start":1150.977,"stop":1168.219,"duration":17.24},{"text":"All of those are tremendous advantages.","start":1168.219,"stop":1171.193,"duration":2.97},{"text":"Now a better
