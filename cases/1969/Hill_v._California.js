searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”","start":64.998,"stop":90.212,"duration":25.21},{"text":"Certainly, this Court has treated the rights of private citizen in the past with great

this case is alleging that his particular arrest which was an invalid arrest and then subsequently the police went on with an unreasonable search that this was a violation to his Fourth Amendment rights even prior to this Court's decision last year in People versus Chimel.","start":113.725,"stop":145.6,"duration":31.88},{"text":"Certainly, in this particular case, the petitioner appealed and

Court.","start":145.6,"stop":164.667,"duration":19.07},{"text":"The particular trial court at the time they were ruling on the evidence of particularly the diary which is really the relevant issue in this particular case because without the diary, the evidence is insufficient to convict the particular petitioner, that at the time the trial judge ruled upon the admissibility of the particular

case.","start":164.667,"stop":201.175,"duration":36.51},{"text":"And what the Court meant, what the trial court meant at that time was not that this factual situation would open the Court, but this

this go on the Court of Appeal.","start":266.077,"stop":286.16,"duration":20.08},{"text":"The Court of Appeal of California reversed based upon the law of Rabinowitz and Harris and then the Supreme Court of California affirmed the conviction in using those same two cases as guidelines.","start":286.16,"stop":301.496,"duration":15.34},{"text":"It would seem based on the factual situation in this case that what we have here is the petitioner absent from his residence that the police finding information out from co-companions this case as the Court is aware of involved four individuals robbing a particular house and then two of those individuals shortly thereafter, a day or two thereafter was captured by the police on an unrelated crime possession of marijuana.","start":301.496,"stop":333.835,"duration":32.34},{"text":"The police at that time had information from those particular police officers and the victims of the robbery itself also a

Hill.","start":346.891,"stop":352.553,"duration":5.66},{"text":"Clearly, there was but it is the petitioner's contention that the rights of privacy that this Court has constantly held is the rights of privacy of the house and not the fact that reasonable cause allowed a mistaken arrest to then give effect and authority to an unreasonable search.","start":352.553,"stop":373.107,"duration":20.55},{"text":"First of all, the arrest itself was made which the -- excuse me, the petitioner contends in debatably good

Miller.","start":396.342,"stop":404.421,"duration":8.08},{"text":"Miller stated that he was not Miller.","start":404.421,"stop":407.559,"duration":3.14},{"text":"Miller gave identification showing

so?","start":430.433,"stop":439.782,"duration":9.35}]},{"speakerName":"Joseph Amato","textObjs":[{"text":"That is correct, Your Honor but I think from the standpoint, when you take all these factors, the fact that there was couple inches in discrepancy in the height, 10 pounds in the weight that that could be said that he was Miller and that he was in Hill's apartment that at this particular point in time, he showed identification that he was Miller.","start":439.782,"stop":457.839,"duration":18.06},{"text":"There's no information that the officers had prior to go into the residence of Hill that there was another person and there was no indication that Miller knew that the officers were coming in there or Hill.","start":457.839,"stop":470.434,"duration":12.6},{"text":"So the officers and I think the case cited in the friend of the court brief shows that the officers are required to use diligence and prudence when they arrest the particular person and most of these cases hold that when a person or officer does not use diligence that in fact is an -- a bad faith arrest.","start":470.434,"stop":497.958,"duration":27.52},{"text":"In one particular case cited by the friend of the court brief, it even held that particular officer liable in damages for an amount of $1,500.00 and in that particular dissenting opinion and I'm referring to Walton versus Will, 66 Cal. 2d 509, the

important that this initial arrest should also be considered in light of the total search itself which the petitioner contends is unreasonable so then we go on to the search itself.","start":560.58,"stop":579.752,"duration":19.17},{"text":"The search was directed towards the bedroom, a material search which disclosed a particular diary and some of the other fruits of the search.","start":579.752,"stop":590.137,"duration":10.38},{"text":"A diary is the area that the petitioner contends as totally unreasonable as far as the search is concerned and that it is totally inconsistent with Rabinowitz, with Harris or any other cases that this particular Court has decided.","start":590.137,"stop":607.143,"duration":17.01},{"text":"First of all, the officers had no way of getting the search warrant based upon the information they had regarding the diary.","start":607.143,"stop":617.07,"duration":9.93},{"text":"The fact that they were able to search that particular residence and assuming they are allowed to search the drawers and rummage through the particular dresser drawers, this Court has always state in the past that because you have a lawful search does necessarily mean that you have a right to seize.","start":617.07,"stop":638.992,"duration":21.92},{"text":"In the respondent's brief, it is indicated that they came across this particular diary in the search for other items and we're talking about cameras, we're talking about clothes and certain types of hoods that the particular suspects wore during the commission of the robbery.","start":638.992,"stop":662.158,"duration":23.17},{"text":"Even in People versus Harris which is probably the most liberal decision allowing the police to search, this Court held that not in all cases will they allow such an extensive search.","start":662.158,"stop":677.847,"duration":15.69},{"text":"Certainly, in Harris they were looking for checks, two to $10,000.00 checks and by the nature of the search, by the nature of the things that they were looking for, it would require looking into a particular drawer or books or personal belongings.","start":677.847,"stop":696.694,"duration":18.85},{"text":"But what information the officers had in this particular case did not require that type of search.","start":696.694,"stop":704.008,"duration":7.31},{"text":"And if in fact they did and as concluded by this Court, that they made a reasonable search then it's submitted by the petitioner that it was an unlawful seizure.","start":704.008,"stop":715.879,"duration":11.87},{"text":"And Boyd versus United States has held that an unlawful search or an unlawful seizure are not dependent upon each other.","start":715.879,"stop":729.541,"duration":13.66},{"text":"So certainly, the petitioner is strongly contending for that one item alone that it was an unreasonable search and seizure.","start":729.541,"stop":738.347,"duration":8.81}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"And that's a proceeding on the premise that there was a probable cause to make an

speak.","start":752.242,"stop":758.928,"duration":6.69},{"text":"We have raised issues relevant to the arrest itself and the seizure itself and certainly we wanted the arrest itself, the fact that it wasn't the person that the officers were there to make sure that all the circumstances of the case were before the Court.","start":758.928,"stop":781.412,"duration":22.48},{"text":"Certainly, it doesn't need dwelling on that Rabinowitz and Harris which the California Supreme Court relied on to affirm the conviction of the petitioner is totally different from the fact situation in this case.","start":781.412,"stop":799.582,"duration":18.17},{"text":"I already indicated this in my particular brief and I don't believe it needs elaboration on at this time but certainly we are emphasizing at this time that there is really no degree of consistency with the fact situation, the application of the Fourth Amendment in that case as compared to the case at bar.","start":799.582,"stop":835.411,"duration":35.83},{"text":"I would like to go to the second point and that's to the determination of whether or not this Court will make Chimel, People versus Chimel retroactive or not.","start":835.411,"stop":848.923,"duration":13.51},{"text":"In this particular case, I think it directly comes into play another part, another exception, another area on the part of the prosecution to press their case.","start":848.923,"stop":865.602,"duration":16.68},{"text":"I think it's another area that this Court could reverse in addition to the very initial contention the petitioners made.","start":865.602,"stop":875.851,"duration":10.25},{"text":"And that is the fact that Chimel, People versus Chimel decided last year clearly limits the police to search a particular residence and while many questions have been raised as to how far the police are allowed to search certainly, this instance where the particular arrest was made in the living room or this Court hasn't cited that as not a material fact.","start":875.851,"stop":908.269,"duration":32.42},{"text":"Then the search was made beyond the immediate scope of the particular petitioner that I quote, “petitioner because in fact he was not even present that the arrest could not or search could not pursue into the living room, into drawers and in fact the general and exploratory search to find evidence of the crime.”","start":908.269,"stop":932.488,"duration":24.22}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"This was -- how big was this

decision from this Court changing the particular law.","start":1017.675,"stop":1047.353,"duration":29.68},{"text":"The petitioner strongly contends that making Chimel retroactive will not have that

cases without opinion.","start":1084.582,"stop":1110.468,"duration":25.89},{"text":"And when the cases are not utilizing Chimel on direct appeal that they seem to state what this Court has stated in
