that he traveled across the country delivering lectures which were advertised and open to the public.","start":55.868,"stop":73.069,"duration":17.2},{"text":"The writings and lectures claimed that specified ailments could alleviated by the consumption of certain foods and food elements and that the best sources of these were the products offered for sale by the corporation.","start":73.069,"stop":88.911,"duration":15.84},{"text":"These products were sold in booths and/or near the lecture halls and were also available in health food stores generally.","start":88.911,"stop":98.07,"duration":9.16},{"text":"Respondent Feldten acted as Kordel's assistant selling products at the lectures and taking orders for shipments from Detroit.","start":98.07,"stop":107.841,"duration":9.77},{"text":"The criminal charges were that as to some of the products certain of the books and leaflets constituted part of the labeling and contained false and misleading statements.","start":107.841,"stop":121.905,"duration":14.06},{"text":"And as to all of the counts on which respondents were convicted, the products which they claim to be merely food supplements were in fact drugs because they were intended by the defendants to be used for the prevention and treatment of various diseases and health conditions, and that the labeling of these products failed to set forth adequate directions for the uses for which they were intended as required by the act.","start":121.905,"stop":157.699,"duration":35.79},{"text":"Since the oral

Procedure.","start":221.908,"stop":231.332,"duration":9.42},{"text":"The Government's interrogatories were served in January and April of 1961 and sought among other things detailed information about the labeling, testing, manufacture, and composition of certain of the products and about Kordel's oral representations concerning the efficacy of these products made during public lectures that he gave in Detroit.","start":231.332,"stop":262.723,"duration":31.39},{"text":"In late January 1961, shortly after service of the Government's initial interrogatories, the corporation received a notice

the libel.","start":262.723,"stop":290.123,"duration":27.4},{"text":"The corporation then in April 1961 moved that the District Court extend its time to respond to the interrogatories until final disposition of any criminal prosecution that might be brought.","start":290.123,"stop":306.264,"duration":16.14},{"text":"The District Court denied this motion in June 1961, holding that their was no

become available to the Government in any event from the trial of the libel proceeding.","start":306.264,"stop":331.726,"duration":25.46},{"text":"Pursuant to the Court's order, the corporation then filed answers to some of the interrogatories in September 1961 and filed specific objections to others.","start":331.726,"stop":342.674,"duration":10.95},{"text":"In subsequent proceedings, some of the objections were sustained and some are overruled and the Government withdrew some of the interrogatories.","start":342.674,"stop":350.943,"duration":8.27},{"text":"The corporation then answered the remaining interrogatories in September 1962.","start":350.943,"stop":356.932,"duration":5.99},{"text":"Respondent Feldten subscribed to all of the corporation's answers as Vice President and stated that they were true to the best of his knowledge and belief, but that not all of the answers were known to him personally.","start":356.932,"stop":372.706,"duration":15.77},{"text":"The libel proceeding thereafter terminated in a consent decree, entered in November 1962.","start":372.706,"stop":381.821,"duration":9.12},{"text":"In June 1962, after service of the interrogatories and after the corporation's initial answers, but prior to its supplemental answers, the Food and Drug Administration referred the matter to the Department of Justice with the recommendation for criminal prosecution.","start":381.821,"stop":402.012,"duration":20.19},{"text":"The indictment was returned in August 1963.","start":402.012,"stop":407.297,"duration":5.29},{"text":"In March 1965, defendants in the criminal case moved to suppress any evidence obtained by the Government as a result of the corporation's answers to the interrogatories in the libel proceeding or in the alternative for a hearing to determine the Government's motive in bringing the civil action and serving the interrogatories.","start":407.297,"stop":432.376,"duration":25.08},{"text":"The District Court granted the alternative request for a hearing which lasted three days.","start":432.376,"stop":439.794,"duration":7.42},{"text":"The transcript of the hearing, set forth in the appendix at pages 58 to 290, showed that at the time the civil case was filed, the Food and Drug Administration already had evidence sufficient in its judgment to establish all the elements of the criminal violations, but had not yet decided whether to recommend criminal prosecution that the agency determined that the in rem seizure proceeding should be commenced promptly in order to prevent harm to the public from continued distribution of the misbranded drugs.","start":439.794,"stop":482.81,"duration":43.02},{"text":"And that the interrogatories were designed solely for the purposes of the civil suit and were submitted as they are routinely in such suits in an effort to narrow the issues for trial and in the hope of laying the foundation for a motion for summary judgment or possibly inducing the corporation to agree to a consent decree by demonstrating the insubstantiality of its case which is what eventually happened.","start":482.81,"stop":515.711,"duration":32.9},{"text":"The District Court held on the basis of this hearing that the governmental decisions to commence the civil suit and to serve the interrogatories were made in good faith and not for the purpose of procuring evidence for a criminal prosecution, and the conviction followed.","start":515.711,"stop":538.076,"duration":22.37},{"text":"And while not disagreeing with these findings, the Court of Appeals reversed respondent's convictions on the ground that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination of the individual criminal defendants have been violated by requiring the corporation to answer the interrogatories in the civil proceeding.","start":538.076,"stop":561.651,"duration":23.57},{"text":"The Court held that it was constitutionally insufficient that the Government had acted in good faith in the civil proceeding and that none of the answers to the interrogatories had been introduced into evidence in the criminal case.","start":561.651,"stop":577.302,"duration":15.65},{"text":"It held that the Government must also prove that it had not in anyway utilized for purposes of the criminal case, information or leads obtained from the answers to the interrogatories.","start":577.302,"stop":594.251,"duration":16.95},{"text":"In its initial opinion, the Court of Appeals also reversed the corporation's conviction, but on the Government's petition for rehearing, it modified its opinion in judgment so as to affirm that conviction on the ground that the privilege against self-incrimination is available under this Court's decisions only to natural persons and not to a corporation.","start":594.251,"stop":618.566,"duration":24.32},{"text":"A petition for certiorari by the corporation was denied by this Court and a petition for rehearing is presently pending.","start":618.566,"stop":628.889,"duration":10.32},{"text":"We contend, first, that the Court of Appeals aired in holding that respondents privilege against self-incrimination had been violated.","start":628.889,"stop":639.915,"duration":11.03},{"text":"Neither of the respondents had interposed any claim to the seized drugs, nor did either of them have a personal property interest in the drugs.","start":639.915,"stop":651.414,"duration":11.5},{"text":"Neither of them was party to the civil action.","start":651.414,"stop":654.965,"duration":3.55},{"text":"Neither of them was obligated or required to answer any of the interrogatories served on the corporation in that proceeding, and indeed, respondent Kordel supplied no answers.","start":654.965,"stop":667.27,"duration":12.3},{"text":"And respondent Feldten who did submit answers on behalf of the corporation stated therein that the truth of the answers was not known to him personally, so the answers did not constitute an admission on his part.","start":667.27,"stop":684.292,"duration":17.02},{"text":"And finally, neither respondent in anyway claimed that his privilege was being violated when respondent Feldten submitted the answers on behalf of the corporation.","start":684.292,"stop":698.732,"duration":14.44},{"text":"The explicit language of Rule 33 dealing with interrogatories and the decisions implementing the rule make clear that when a corporation is the party served with interrogatories, the corporation is obligated to appoint an agent who without fear of self-incrimination can furnish such requested information as is available to the corporation.","start":698.732,"stop":730.282,"duration":31.55},{"text":"No claim was made in the libel proceeding that answers to any of the questions were not available to the corporation within the meaning of the rule because the only repositories of the information were individuals who might incriminate themselves by disclosing it.","start":730.282,"stop":750.04,"duration":19.76},{"text":"No individual is required under the rule to submit any answer on the corporation's behalf that might tend to incriminate him personally.","start":750.04,"stop":761.83,"duration":11.79},{"text":"But the corporation which under this Court's decisions has no privilege against self-incrimination and cannot invoke the privilege of any individual on its behalf remains obligated under the rule to provide such requested information as is available to it.","start":761.83,"stop":782.012,"duration":20.18},{"text":"To the extent that this obligation with the attendant risk that failure of the corporation to comply might result in a judgment forfeiting the corporation's property constitutes compulsion.","start":782.012,"stop":798.149,"duration":16.14},{"text":"It is compulsion of the corporation which has no privilege and not of the respondents as officers or shareholders of the corporation.","start":798.149,"stop":810.685,"duration":12.54},{"text":"To hold otherwise would be to overrule Campbell Painting Corporation against Reid in volume 392 U.S. and its predecessor decisions because compulsion of a corporation to provide possibly incriminating information can always be said to amount to compulsion of its individual officers or shareholders.","start":810.685,"stop":837.107,"duration":26.42},{"text":"They cannot utilized the corporate form of doing business and yet claim a personal interest in the corporation's property only for purposes of the Fifth Amendment privilege.","start":837.107,"stop":850.691,"duration":13.58},{"text":"That is the meaning of these Court's decisions and it was error in our view for the Court of
