I. case which this Court decided in 1964 and which we say is determinative of the issues here because there too when the merger was consummated, the people took the risk, decided they go ahead knowing there was a lawsuit pending but nevertheless went ahead with the knowledge of what the claims of the plaintiffs were.","start":309.977,"stop":347.393,"duration":37.42},{"text":"The -- since the facts were undisputed because we have there sworn statements with other case, the District Court took the view that the shareholders were entitled to be informed of these interrelationships between the Board of Directors making the recommendation and the adversary in the merger negotiations and entered judgment -- a summary judgment under rule 56 (c) of the Federal Rules of several procedure which is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of fact that there have been a violation through nondisclosure of a material fact or facts.","start":347.393,"stop":390.978,"duration":43.59},{"text":"The Court reserved however brought up the question of cause or relationship and after hearings were held on the cause of relationship

statement.","start":390.978,"stop":411.325,"duration":20.35},{"text":"The Court then made a further finding and entered a supplemental summary judgment holding that the issue of liability had been

interest, the relationship with the adversary was so material that a violation had occurred so the Court of Appeals in a very carefully considered opinion rule that there had been this violation of the Section 14 and Rule 14 (a) and Rule 14 of the regulations promulgated by the SEC.","start":438.722,"stop":474.797,"duration":36.08},{"text":"The District Court reserved all questions of relief for

finding.","start":492.141,"stop":502.099,"duration":9.96},{"text":"Since the Court of Appeals found that there had been a violation and that the facts not disclosed were material, the respondents here filed no petition for certiorari and did not seek to save that question for review by this Court.","start":502.099,"stop":525.873,"duration":23.77},{"text":"When petitioners filed a petition, the respondents resisted our petition, filed no cross petition, and we believe that that matter is therefore not pending before this Court.","start":525.873,"stop":537.845,"duration":11.97},{"text":"Now, this Court requested the Government to file a brief as amicus and the Government in its brief as will be noted aggress with petitioners' view as to what issues are pending on this certiorari hearing and theirs are essentially the same as our.","start":537.845,"stop":555.919,"duration":18.07},{"text":"That was the Government.","start":555.919,"stop":556.8,"duration":0.88},{"text":"The respondents

Courts.","start":556.8,"stop":568.304,"duration":11.5},{"text":"We have not answered that because we have felt governed by the rules of this Court and we've adhered to the question only that on which this Court granted certiorari.","start":568.304,"stop":579.893,"duration":11.59},{"text":"The -- now in a separate portion of the opinion, the Court of Appeals deals with the question of causation.","start":579.893,"stop":588.939,"duration":9.05},{"text":"And here it rules that the District Court was an error.","start":588.939,"stop":593.966,"duration":5.03},{"text":"Although agreeing that the proxy statement caused the merger in the sense that those essential to the merger were procured through the unlawful proxy statement, the Court of Appeals laid down a different test of causation asking whether the misleading statement and omission caused the submission of sufficient proxies to change the result of the vote as the Court of Appeals said more exact question is whether that particular misrepresentation and are wrongful -- material wrongful omission actually resulted in the votes.","start":593.966,"stop":635.247,"duration":41.28},{"text":"The cracks of the Court of Appeals' opinion, lies at this point toward the end.","start":635.247,"stop":640.715,"duration":5.47},{"text":"It's within the last two pages of the opinion.","start":640.715,"stop":643.962,"duration":3.25},{"text":"The material offered by defendants on the merits of the terms of merger suggest that it may be possible for them to satisfy the Court by preponderance of probabilities that the merger would have received a sufficient even if the proxy statement had not been misleading in the respect found.","start":643.962,"stop":666.843,"duration":22.88},{"text":"The petitioners take the position that this kind of speculation or guesswork attempt to unscramble the minds of the 5400 minority shareholders who voted for the merger is essentially going to be a guesswork proposition.","start":666.843,"stop":690.362,"duration":23.52},{"text":"The type of undertaking that courts do not undertake.","start":690.362,"stop":693.416,"duration":3.05},{"text":"There are many decisions fully won by Justice Cardozo long ago in which at common law, he said that we can't get in to these nice

of Appeals was really talked about here.","start":717.805,"stop":720.152,"duration":2.35},{"text":"They speak of a footnote when they say the Court's finding question common law is reliance.","start":720.152,"stop":725.591,"duration":5.44},{"text":"Now, there's nothing in the Borak case, there's nothing in the Exchange Act of 1934 which is before this Court.","start":725.591,"stop":732.69,"duration":7.1},{"text":"There's nothing in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission that says anything about reliance.","start":732.69,"stop":738.922,"duration":6.23},{"text":"The -- we get down to the question of what is the purpose of this legislation.","start":738.922,"stop":743.366,"duration":4.44},{"text":"Our text must be Borak because we think Borak inclusively disposes in this case.","start":743.366,"stop":749.739,"duration":6.37},{"text":"The test is what was the purpose?","start":749.739,"stop":754.208,"duration":4.47},{"text":"And the purpose was to have an honest

there may be a fully informed voting on the question that is presented in the proxy statement.","start":770.962,"stop":780.858,"duration":9.9},{"text":"If the proponents of a merger want to set out all of the horrible things and assuming a plan is just terribly untrue and they want to set the whole thing out, and they tell everything fully, there's no violation of the statute.","start":780.858,"stop":793.036,"duration":12.18},{"text":"But the Court of Appeals in interpreting a federal statute has gone the common law standards and creates this impracticable standard as to how you resolve what went on in people's minds and this assumes of course that the stockholders would have voted for any fair merger.","start":793.036,"stop":812.891,"duration":19.86},{"text":"They don't discuss whether it may be just fair, a little bit fair, a whole light fair, overwhelming of what.","start":812.891,"stop":818.655,"duration":5.76},{"text":"The assumption is that the shareholders in guessing what went on their minds and guessing and speculating what they would do would vote for a fair merger.","start":818.655,"stop":829.003,"duration":10.35},{"text":"Well, that is not consistent with known facts.","start":829.003,"stop":832.926,"duration":3.92},{"text":"People have many reasons for voting.","start":832.926,"stop":835.265,"duration":2.34},{"text":"Here, there were many facts disclosed as to market value, the book value -- the book value here was $88.00 a share and the

weren't even getting the market value of their Auto-Lite shares because the preferred shares of Mergenthaler that would be giving an exchange if converting into common immediately would bring
