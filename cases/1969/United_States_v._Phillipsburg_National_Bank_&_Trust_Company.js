heavier percentage of their deposits in time and savings deposits and a much lower percentage of their deposits than the demand deposits because of the fact that this community just doesn't have the same kind of heavy industry that we have in the large cities and similarly, in terms of their loans, a much greater percentage of their loans were in real estate loans in the big city banks and a much
