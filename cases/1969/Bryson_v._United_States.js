1947.","start":34.376,"stop":45.501,"duration":11.13},{"text":"That Act provided in substance that before a labor union could resort to the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board.","start":45.501,"stop":55.117,"duration":9.62},{"text":"Each of its officers most annually signed in filing non-Communist affidavit.","start":55.117,"stop":62.899,"duration":7.78},{"text":"The constitutionality of that statute was upheld in 1950 in the case of American Communications Association against Douds.","start":62.899,"stop":74.37,"duration":11.47},{"text":"The chief opinion was written by Chief Justice Vinson in which two other members of the court concurred, Justices Frankfurter and Jackson wrote separate opinions, concurring in part and dissenting in part.","start":74.37,"stop":89.097,"duration":14.73},{"text":"Mr. Justice Black dissented on a number of grounds including explicitly an expression of his view of Section 9 (h) was a bill of attainder and therefore violated the Article I Section 9 of the Constitution.","start":89.097,"stop":105.501,"duration":16.4},{"text":"Congress, it appears was not satisfied with its experience under Section 9 (h) and 12 years after its passage, nine years after this Court was persuaded to sustain it.","start":105.501,"stop":118.895,"duration":13.39},{"text":"The Congress have repealed that law and replaced it with Section 504 of the Labor Management Relations Act.","start":118.895,"stop":126.277,"duration":7.38},{"text":"That Section provided that it was a crime for a man simultaneously to hold union office and to be a member of the Communist Party.","start":126.277,"stop":138.818,"duration":12.54},{"text":"That statute was held unconstitutional by this Court in United States against Archie Brown, 1965 in an opinion written by the Chief Justice, four other members of the Court concurring in the opinion on the expressed ground of Section 504 was unconstitutional bill of attainder.","start":138.818,"stop":159.266,"duration":20.45},{"text":"One of the questions certified in this case is whether in the comparative light of American Communications Association versus doubts and United States versus Brown, Section 9 (h) is constitutional.","start":159.266,"stop":174.858,"duration":15.59},{"text":"Let me say a few words about the background of this case in order to put the other two certified questions in perspective.","start":174.858,"stop":182.799,"duration":7.94},{"text":"Petitioner here was one time the president of a small maritime labor union numbering some 3,000 members who served on vessels plying in and out of Pacific Coast Port in the Steward’s Department of those ships.","start":182.799,"stop":202.086,"duration":19.29},{"text":"In 1951, he signed and filed the affidavit as required -- that was required at the time under Taft-Hartley law.","start":202.086,"stop":211.469,"duration":9.38},{"text":"The union was and had been for some time engaged in the bitter jurisdictional dispute which ultimately led to the dissolution of the organization itself.","start":211.469,"stop":222.224,"duration":10.75},{"text":"Now, the affidavit that he filed was a printed form.","start":222.224,"stop":225.745,"duration":3.52},{"text":"But the Labor Board supplied and it recited three basic things.","start":225.745,"stop":231.208,"duration":5.46},{"text":"It recited that the files at the time he signed did not then support any organization that advocated the overthrow of the Government by force, violation or other unconstitutional or illegal means.","start":231.208,"stop":244.872,"duration":13.66},{"text":"It provided second that he said he was then not a member of the Communist Party specifically naming the Communist Party in the second portion.","start":244.872,"stop":254.385,"duration":9.51},{"text":"It provided third, that he was not then affiliate for the Communist Party.","start":254.385,"stop":261.017,"duration":6.63},{"text":"In 1954, almost three yeas after the filing of the 1951 affidavit although I should state that in 1952 Bryson filed the affidavit.","start":261.017,"stop":271.534,"duration":10.52},{"text":"He did the same in 1953 and again in 1954 if my memory served me correctly, even after he was indicted on the 1951 affidavit.","start":271.534,"stop":283.015,"duration":11.48},{"text":"He was charged in the indictment with three counts of violation, all three of the portions that I have mentioned","start":283.015,"stop":290.949,"duration":7.93},{"text":".Prior to the trial, the Government dismissed the count that charged him of supporting an organization that advocated the overthrow of the Government.","start":290.949,"stop":300.739,"duration":9.79},{"text":"He went to trial on the counts concerning membership and concerning affiliation.","start":300.739,"stop":306.239,"duration":5.5},{"text":"The jury returned the verdict holding or I should say that this was brought under the false statement statute which it set forth in our brief and in the petition.","start":306.239,"stop":316.278,"duration":10.04},{"text":"Jury returned the verdict holding that when he swore that he was not been a member of the Communist Party he was not falsely swearing.","start":316.278,"stop":324.394,"duration":8.12},{"text":"On the other hand, it returned the verdict holding that he did violate the law when he swore that he was not then affiliated for the Communist Party.","start":324.394,"stop":334.342,"duration":9.95},{"text":"Bryson was sentence to five years in prison and a fine of $10,000 which was the maximum.","start":334.342,"stop":341.34,"duration":7},{"text":"And in addition, the trial judge provided expressly that he could be subject to further imprisonment in the event that he failed to pay the fine.","start":341.34,"stop":351.562,"duration":10.22},{"text":"He served nearly two years of his term and then was paroled.","start":351.562,"stop":355.994,"duration":4.43},{"text":"And in the intervening years he has managed to pay $2,000 of the $10,000 fine but the there is a balance of $8,000.","start":355.994,"stop":366.531,"duration":10.54},{"text":"Shortly before we filed a petition in the District Court that commenced the proceedings that are now here, the Government noticed the taking of Bryson’s deposition of the original criminal proceeding and did take his -- the position seeking assets for the purpose of enforcing the collection of the $8,000 balance.","start":366.531,"stop":389.464,"duration":22.93},{"text":"And thereafter, the Government filed a civil action in the Federal District Court in San Francisco seeking judgment for the $8,000.","start":389.464,"stop":398.096,"duration":8.63},{"text":"A week or two after that, Bryson’s petition was filed with the District Court seeking a writ of error coram nobis or relief under the other applicable post-conviction statutes.","start":398.096,"stop":413.233,"duration":15.14},{"text":"One of the basic grounds upon which that relief was sought was the allegation that under United States versus Brown, the constitutional basis of Section 9 (h) had been eroded along with other decisions that it was constitutionally infirmed, that it should be controlled by the decision of this Court in United States against Brown and therefore that petition of original conviction had been unconstitutionally obtained.","start":413.233,"stop":439.358,"duration":26.13},{"text":"The District Judge granted petition in all respects except not granting the prayer for a return of the $2,000 that Bryson has paid to the Government on his fine.","start":439.358,"stop":451.275,"duration":11.92},{"text":"The Government took an appeal to the Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit and that court in a per curiam decision reversed holding that Bryson was precluded for bringing his petition by reason of a decision of this Court in Dennis versus the United States.","start":451.275,"stop":469.499,"duration":18.22},{"text":"That case was a case in which this Court declined to review a challenge of constitutionality against Section 9 (h) upon the ground for the petitions in that case were shown to have been engaged in a conspiracy to deceive and to the defraud the Government and therefore that they had lost standing.","start":469.499,"stop":492.214,"duration":22.71},{"text":"The Court of Appeals holding that Dennis presented an insuperable obstacle to us declined the test on the other questions and reversed.","start":492.214,"stop":505.532,"duration":13.32},{"text":"The other two questions presented and certified here then are: One, whether the petitioner is precluded by reason of this Court’s decision in Dennis from attacking the constitutionality of 9 (h).","start":505.532,"stop":518.866,"duration":13.33},{"text":"The other is whether the petitioner qualifies regardless of Dennis upon the ground that it’s inapplicable in as much as this is a post-conviction proceeding and under the all writs section or under the other Section providing for such relief, he would qualify for this relief.","start":518.866,"stop":538.379,"duration":19.51}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"When you talk about the constitutionality of 9 (h) it’s really whether 9 (h) wasn’t

argue also affects to its detriment to the bill of attainder provision in our Constitution.","start":554.074,"stop":571.62,"duration":17.55},{"text":"Now, let me say something about the petitioner of the evidence here.","start":571.62,"stop":577.639,"duration":6.02},{"text":"Because I suppose in the last analysis, this Court is not going to look nearly at forms as the Government invites it to do and say well, in Dennis there was a conspiracy to defraud and Bryson’s case the jury found that he lied about whether or not he was affiliated with the Communist Party and therefore they are on a par, this is the Government’s argument.","start":577.639,"stop":600.321,"duration":22.68},{"text":"I would suppose that if Dennis lays down a rule, the Court created by which the Court will determine in its own discretion whether or not a particular person is entitled to be heard has standing to be heard.","start":600.321,"stop":618.42,"duration":18.1},{"text":"One must look at the character of the particular petitioner in so far at least as the record and the evidence would seem to show.","start":618.42,"stop":625.804,"duration":7.38},{"text":"Now in petitioner’s case, the facts are these.","start":625.804,"stop":629.224,"duration":3.42},{"text":"There’s no question that for a period of ten years between 1937 and 1947, he was a member of the Communist Party.","start":629.224,"stop":637.242,"duration":8.02},{"text":"He was an officer of that party.","start":637.242,"stop":639.486,"duration":2.24},{"text":"He was an officer under what was called the Waterfront Section Level in San Francisco and he was an officer on a state level, state committee.","start":639.486,"stop":647.77,"duration":8.28},{"text":"There was no suggestion in this record that Bryson never tried to concede the fact that his membership or holding office in the communist party when he was a member of it.","start":647.77,"stop":658.561,"duration":10.79},{"text":"Now in 1947, he terminated his associations and there is no evidence.","start":658.561,"stop":664.504,"duration":5.94},{"text":"There was no evidence of the trial to sustain any charge that there was an active relationship between him and the party thereafter.","start":664.504,"stop":672.447,"duration":7.94},{"text":"The evidence upon which he was convicted not of membership but of association of affiliation summarize by the Government in its brief, and I assume that they have called from it as much as there is and this is one of the matters to it that comes on pages 5 and 6 of the Government’s brief.","start":672.447,"stop":695.64,"duration":23.19},{"text":"First, he said that in 1949, at an open union convention, he -- I quote what they say, “premised -- he refused to see that delegate to a union conversion premised on the delegate’s failure to accept an opportunity to join the Communist Party.”","start":695.64,"stop":715.582,"duration":19.94},{"text":"So not only was that two years before he filed the affidavit in this case.","start":715.582,"stop":720.451,"duration":4.87},{"text":"But I mentioned that this is the type of evidence on which the affiliation count was
