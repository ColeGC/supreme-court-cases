Amendment.","start":1060.023,"stop":1093.669,"duration":33.65},{"text":"If the Court please, my answer to that is that taxing real estate used for religious purposes, like other real estate, is just

private activity.","start":1151.556,"stop":1167.772,"duration":16.22},{"text":"This of course is no longer the case and it explains, I think, why the legislatures have placed religious activities into

this.","start":1203.979,"stop":1207.379,"duration":3.4},{"text":"Now, another answer is that the prayer which this -- the prayer of the public schools and the bible reading in the public schools which this Court has stricken down as unconstitutional, that promotes moral values, just as religious activity promotes moral values, but just as -- that is not a sufficient basis to save the prayer the fact that it promotes a secular object, if you will, namely moral considerations, if it is not enough to save that the prayer, it is not enough to save the tax exemption.","start":1207.379,"stop":1249.406,"duration":42.03},{"text":"Now, the last argument that's made on this point by Mr. Rankin is that this Court has approved other

let them run their business on Sunday.","start":1259.541,"stop":1287.721,"duration":28.18},{"text":"The distinction, we submit, is that the power of the Congress in the interest of national defense
