Your Honors are well aware, there are two kinds of disputes that arise under that Act.","start":44.895,"stop":51.262,"duration":6.37},{"text":"The so-called minor disputes which involve the interpretation or application of the existing agreements and they follow the course of negotiation and if that fails, compulsory arbitration before an Adjustment Board whose decisions are final and binding on the parties.","start":51.262,"stop":71.362,"duration":20.1},{"text":"And then there's the major dispute involving not the interpretation or application of existing agreements, but the making or changing of existing agreements and these follow a different course.","start":71.362,"stop":88.008,"duration":16.65},{"text":"Section 6 notice proposing a change is served as negotiation, mediation and proffer of arbitration in the discretion of the President's appointment of an Emergency Board and then the parties are free to exercise self-help at the end of that route.","start":88.008,"stop":105.27,"duration":17.26},{"text":"In this case, an Adjustment Board determined that there was nothing in existing agreements which precluded Shore Line from establishing an outlying reporting point, the point at which a fireman might be required to report for work at the end of the day away from the main terminal.","start":105.27,"stop":132.799,"duration":27.53},{"text":"Shore Line proposed to establish such a point.","start":132.799,"stop":136.937,"duration":4.14},{"text":"The Union served a notice proposing that the exclusive reporting point should be at the home terminal at Toledo.","start":136.937,"stop":145.808,"duration":8.87},{"text":"And the court below held that in virtue of the mere filing of that notice to deprive Shore Line of its right under the existing agreement to establish an outlying terminal, that was accomplished and they were deprived of that right.","start":145.808,"stop":167.311,"duration":21.5},{"text":"Now, the facts are briefly these.","start":167.311,"stop":171.643,"duration":4.33},{"text":"Shore Line is a small railroad.","start":171.643,"stop":173.925,"duration":2.28},{"text":"It runs about 50 miles from Toledo to Detroit.","start":173.925,"stop":180.732,"duration":6.81},{"text":"Lang Yard is the mainline.","start":180.732,"stop":182.509,"duration":1.78},{"text":"The yard at Toledo is the yard just south of Detroit called Dearoad and there's one other geographic point I have in mind, that's at Trenton where there's the Edison Yard, that's about 35 miles north of Toledo.","start":182.509,"stop":201.929,"duration":19.42},{"text":"There's a growing and large industrial development at Trenton.","start":201.929,"stop":210.491,"duration":8.56},{"text":"While outlying points have historically been established, for many years, Trenton was served by firemen who reported at the Toledo Yard and took their -- went with their engines up to Trenton, did the switching there, then went back to 35 miles and tied up at Toledo.","start":210.491,"stop":233.957,"duration":23.47},{"text":"In 1961, this growing industrial development in the view of the railroad required that they establish an outlying point at Trenton and they served or they proposed to the Union that they would establish an outlying point at Trenton.","start":233.957,"stop":253.952,"duration":20},{"text":"The Union served a Section 6 notice proposing negotiations on terms or conditions under which that outlying assignment should be established.","start":253.952,"stop":267.025,"duration":13.07},{"text":"Negotiations were to had, mediation was had, proffer of arbitration, finally, the matter was released.","start":267.025,"stop":276.866,"duration":9.84},{"text":"But at that time there was no strike and at a subsequent point the Union withdrew that notice and there wasn't the establishment of the reporting point of Trenton.","start":276.866,"stop":290.814,"duration":13.95},{"text":"The alternate year for switching at Montesanto by Shore Line could pass and they said we don't to propose to establish this point at Trenton.","start":290.814,"stop":302.676,"duration":11.86},{"text":"But in the meantime late 1962 and in again September 1963, they established an outlying point just south of Detroit and called it Dearoad and on this occasion the Union pursued the minor dispute route.","start":302.676,"stop":326.642,"duration":23.97},{"text":"It took it to an Adjustment Board and it urged that under existing agreements, and under their existing practices Shore Line was barred from establishing this outlying reporting point at Dearoad.","start":326.642,"stop":346.575,"duration":19.93},{"text":"The Adjustment Board decided against them.","start":346.575,"stop":348.951,"duration":2.38},{"text":"The Adjustment Board said there's nothing in the rule of agreement which precludes the establishment at that point and I think it's not contested that under the existing agreements then Shore Line was privileged to establish that outlying point.","start":348.951,"stop":369.332,"duration":20.38},{"text":"They then proposed again to establish an outlying reporting point at Trenton and the response to that was a Section 6 notice proposing that the only point at which firemen might be required to report would be the Toledo Yard.","start":369.332,"stop":392.922,"duration":23.59}]},{"speakerName":"Potter

invoked the issue and the mediation was pending at the time of this record was made.","start":413.842,"stop":424.871,"duration":11.03},{"text":"In late September 1966, Shore Line being confronted with the immediate requirement again switching Montesanto with McClould having demanded a series of it, they posted a bulletin establishing an outlying assignment at Trenton for trains to operate in the switching of these industrial establishments at Trenton.","start":424.871,"stop":453.568,"duration":28.7},{"text":"At that point, the Union threatened a strike.","start":453.568,"stop":461.472,"duration":7.9},{"text":"Shore Line sought an injunction against the strike.","start":461.472,"stop":466.927,"duration":5.46},{"text":"The Union counterclaimed for an injunction against the establishment of this outlying point.","start":466.927,"stop":475.189,"duration":8.26},{"text":"The District Court denied the injunction against the strike, granted the injunction against the establishment of the outlying point.","start":475.189,"stop":484.664,"duration":9.47},{"text":"The court below affirmed and the issue is, I suppose, is the correctness of the decision below on certiorari to this Court.","start":484.664,"stop":496.864,"duration":12.2},{"text":"Now, the only provisions of the Railway Labor Act which are actually involved here are Section 2 (7) and Section 6, the so-called status quo provision of Section 6, in fact you've indicated that these two sections have to be read together and may I read them to you.","start":496.864,"stop":523.268,"duration":26.4},{"text":"The first appears on Section 2 (a), page 2 (a) of our brief and that Section 2 (7) which reads as follows: “No carrier, its officers or agents shall change the rates of pay, rules or working conditions of its employees as a class as embodied in agreements except in the manner prescribed in such agreements or in Section 6 of the Act.”","start":523.268,"stop":554.324,"duration":31.06},{"text":"Now, I think there's no contest about the fact that that bars only a change in the existing agreements.","start":554.324,"stop":562.741,"duration":8.42},{"text":"It does not deprive the parties of the rights under the existing agreements.","start":562.741,"stop":569.096,"duration":6.36},{"text":"And Section 6 reads, carriers, that's on 5 (a) of the appendix, “carriers and representative to the employees shall give at least 30 days written notice of an intended change in agreements affecting rates of pay, rules or working conditions with time and place in the beginning of conferences between representatives of parties in such intended change should be agreed upon within ten days after the receipt of said notice.","start":569.096,"stop":600.329,"duration":31.23},{"text":"That time should be within the 30 days provided in every case where such notice of an intended change has been given or conferences are being held with reference thereto of service of the Mediation Board have been requested by either party or said Board has proffered its services, rates of pay, rules or working conditions shall not be altered by the carrier until the controversy has been finally acted upon as required by Section 5 of this Act by the Mediation Board” etcetera.","start":600.329,"stop":632.828,"duration":32.5},{"text":"Now, what we say that this provision of Section 6 means read together with Section 2 is what this Court said it meant in Williams against the Terminal Company.","start":632.828,"stop":652.94,"duration":20.11},{"text":"Here's what the Court said, \"The institution of negotiations,\" that is the filing of the Section 6 notice, “the institution of negotiations for collective bargaining does not change the authority of the carrier.”","start":652.94,"stop":671.788,"duration":18.85},{"text":"The prohibitions of Section 6, against change of wages or conditions pending bargaining and those of Section 2 (7) are aimed at preventing changes in conditions previously fixed by collective bargaining agreements.","start":671.788,"stop":694.573,"duration":22.78},{"text":"But we say Section 6 means is again what this Court said it meant in Order of Railroad Conductors against Pitney.","start":694.573,"stop":705.373,"duration":10.8},{"text":"There this Court said, 2 (7) of the Act provides that no carrier its officers or agents shall change the rates of pay, rules, or working conditions of its employees as a class, as embodied in agreements except in the manner prescribed in such agreements under Section 6 of the Act.","start":705.373,"stop":727.896,"duration":22.52},{"text":"Section 6 as we have seen prohibits such change unless notice is first given and its requirements were otherwise complied with.","start":727.896,"stop":740.371,"duration":12.48},{"text":"Section 2 (10) of the Act makes it a misdemeanor punishable by both fine and imprisonment for a carrier willfully that violates Section 6.","start":740.371,"stop":750.646,"duration":10.27},{"text":"These sections, these sections make it clear that the only conduct which would violate Section 6 is a change of those working conditions which are embodied in agreements.","start":750.646,"stop":769.717,"duration":19.07},{"text":"Now, what we think it means is also what the Mediation Board has consistently interpreted as meaning.","start":769.717,"stop":780.87,"duration":11.15},{"text":"Since 1956, the Board repeated, Mediation Board repeatedly in its annual reports, in its instructions to mediate it, in its response to demands of the Unions, repeatedly they have said this, and I read their latest pronouncement, pronouncements earlier were of a kind.","start":780.87,"stop":811.82,"duration":30.95},{"text":"In brief, “the rights of the parties which they had prior serving the notice of intention to change, that's part of the serving the Section 6 notice, the rights of the parties which they had prior to serving the notice of intention to change remained the same during the period the proposal is under consideration and remained so until the proposal is finally acted upon.","start":811.82,"stop":848.065,"duration":36.25},{"text":"The Board has stated in instances of this kind that the serving of a Section 6 notice for a new rule or change, a change in an existing rule does not operate, does not operate as a bar to the carrier actions which were taken under rules currently in effect.”","start":848.065,"stop":874.254,"duration":26.19},{"text":"We also think, if the Court please, that the interpretation which we give Section 6 is the interpretation which was given in the making of the legislative history of that provision.","start":874.254,"stop":889.075,"duration":14.82},{"text":"Section 6, the initial Bill, which ultimately became in the subsequent year the 1926 Act, was called the Howell-Barkley Bill and Mr. Richberg in explaining the provision that became Section 6 from what was apparently a prepared text under the heading “changes of agreements” had this to say.","start":889.075,"stop":916.863,"duration":27.79},{"text":"“An agreement that can be changed without notice is really no agreement at all.","start":916.863,"stop":921.825,"duration":4.96},{"text":"Certainly, the power on the one hand and the fear on the other of arbitrary change will read this Court not harmony.”","start":921.825,"stop":928.526,"duration":6.7},{"text":"There is provided in Section 6 that either party shall give at least 30 days written notice of an intended change and that the time and place of conference shall be agreed upon, thereafter a change and it seems to me clearly refers back to the change proposed, thereafter change is prohibited until machinery for peaceful adjustment has been fully utilized.","start":928.526,"stop":953.49,"duration":24.96},{"text":"Now, if the Court please, very important, I think important practical considerations which are entitled to weight.","start":953.49,"stop":964.765,"duration":11.27},{"text":"If I understand the opposing counsel correctly, he says that these so-called status quo provisions briefly applicable, to indeed asserts, simply applicable to the Union and to the carrier and I put them below when he was not willing to bite the bullet then I doubt he will hear, I put in this situation or these two situations.","start":964.765,"stop":995.877,"duration":31.11},{"text":"One of the most cherished rights of workmen in this field are their seniority rights.","start":995.877,"stop":1003.896,"duration":8.02},{"text":"A place opens up, a desirable place, the man who has been there longest can be at the end and the place he opens up than the man with the next greatest seniority can bid that in and so forth.","start":1003.896,"stop":1016.305,"duration":12.41},{"text":"Now, the railroads will suppose serve a notice saying this is disrupting.","start":1016.305,"stop":1023.206,"duration":6.9},{"text":"From now on, we want to assign men to the post that they are investigated for.","start":1023.206,"stop":1029.044,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Now, for the long period, the intentionally long period to exhaust the procedures of the Railroad Labor Act, are the seniority right suspended or to take another situation which is not unusual that this negotiation of an agreement for an increase in wage is 3% next January, another 2% in July, another 3% the following January.","start":1029.044,"stop":1061.735,"duration":32.69},{"text":"They negotiated that bargain and a couple of months later, the Shore Line, the carrier serves notice saying we're losing money and we want to freeze wages.","start":1061.735,"stop":1076.735,"duration":15},{"text":"The length freeze wages for the lengthy period, a year, two years or more in which the procedures of the Railway Labor Act are being exhausted.","start":1076.735,"stop":1088.717,"duration":11.98},{"text":"Now, I say that if he agreed it would do that.","start":1088.717,"stop":1092.272,"duration":3.55},{"text":"I can think of nothing which would more be more disruptive of the stability of labor relations or more frustrating to the possibility of making and maintaining agreements in such a rule.","start":1092.272,"stop":1106.764,"duration":14.49},{"text":"Now, as I understand, as I understand his -- the main thrust of his argument, it is that while the provisions of Section 5, their status quo provisions of 5 and 10 which are not applicable to here because this is still in mediation and those are only applicable only after the mediation has terminated or after the Emergency Board is appointed.","start":1106.764,"stop":1135.202,"duration":28.44},{"text":"If I understand the main thrust of his argument, it is that all of these provisions, not all, six, five and ten, must mean the same thing, not two because he concedes two doesn't, isn't to be read with all of them.","start":1135.202,"stop":1155.707,"duration":20.51},{"text":"Now this Court said that had to be read with six in Pitney.","start":1155.707,"stop":1160.089,"duration":4.38},{"text":"He says, that that isn't the status quo provision after the major dispute is arisen.","start":1160.089,"stop":1171.794,"duration":11.71},{"text":"But he says these three have to be read together and he gets some comfort from the language of 5 and 10.","start":1171.794,"stop":1178.987,"duration":7.19},{"text":"Now, I don't understand what comfort he gets from 10, indeed 5, but 10 says that after Emergency Board has been appointed for 30 days after the reports to the President, no change shall be made in the conditions out of which the dispute arose and I think the conditions out of which this dispute arises is that under existing agreements, we have the right to establish an outline point and they want to take it away from us and they proposed that change and it is that's what shouldn't be changed.","start":1178.987,"stop":1216.245,"duration":37.26},{"text":"Well, that means that our rights under the existing agreement shouldn't be changed for this period.","start":1216.245,"stop":1221.566,"duration":5.32},{"text":"Now, 5 provides that after the Mediation Board releases the dispute for 30 days, there shall be no change in rates of pay, rules, working conditions or working conditions or established practices.","start":1221.566,"stop":1245.397,"duration":23.83},{"text":"There is little to indicate the reason for the introduction of established practices.","start":1245.397,"stop":1252.312,"duration":6.91},{"text":"We've done a textual analysis which there isn't time for an oral argument, but I think I can point this out that that

existed.","start":1252.312,"stop":1276.841,"duration":24.53},{"text":"Prior to that when mediation was terminated, the railroads would go in immediately and affected their changes even though later an
