made.","start":623.167,"stop":648.878,"duration":25.71},{"text":"The logistic and manpower problems involved and that the number of people required in at least three or four different locations as

coins.","start":683.196,"stop":691.428,"duration":8.23},{"text":"I don't know whether coins have become a special target in this area and in the Shamel case, some of the prior decisions of the Court with respect to the extent to which a search without a warrant may be made incident to an arrest were sharply cut down.","start":691.428,"stop":719.564,"duration":28.14},{"text":"And there is a consequence of the Shamel case, which I assume is going to have to be presented in later cases.","start":719.564,"stop":729.119,"duration":9.56},{"text":"That is the extent to which granting that the police cannot conduct an extensive search and seizure in the premises incident to an arrest, to what extent can the police officers impose a stillstand on the situation?","start":729.119,"stop":749.812,"duration":20.69},{"text":"Lock the door, keep people from entering and leaving, prevent people inside the premises from destroying evidences while they go through the necessary process obviously requiring under current conditions of several hours of preparing a warrant -- an affidavit for a search warrant under -- in many cases, this will require not merely the police officer but participation by a lawyer and assistant United States attorney or appropriate state officer, typing, finding a magistrate, submitting it to him, and giving him an opportunity to consider it, and then upon it's issuance, the opportunity to serve.","start":749.812,"stop":799.592,"duration":49.78},{"text":"And unless there is some opportunity to impose a stillstand, not to seize but simply to hold things in the status -- status quo, the evidence in many of these cases will be destroyed and the opportunity to make an effective search will evaporate.","start":799.592,"stop":826.04,"duration":26.45},{"text":"Now, that is not this case.","start":826.04,"stop":829.181,"duration":3.14},{"text":"This has nothing to do with a search incident to an arrest.","start":829.181,"stop":835.705,"duration":6.52},{"text":"This is a situation, however, where post office employees in association with other governmental officers, did preserve the situation in status quo by not sending on the package in the normal processes of the U.S. mails.","start":835.705,"stop":857.469,"duration":21.76},{"text":"I would point out too in the consideration of this matter as bearing on the reasonableness of their action that there is no communication involved here.","start":857.469,"stop":867.832,"duration":10.36},{"text":"There is no letter.","start":867.832,"stop":870.191,"duration":2.36},{"text":"There is no transmission of intelligence.","start":870.191,"stop":874.041,"duration":3.85},{"text":"This was simply goods, simply gold coins.","start":874.041,"stop":879.903,"duration":5.86},{"text":"The delay of 29 hours in the delivery of a package is not unprecedented and there is nothing to indicate that it was a matter of any seriousness to anyone involved.","start":879.903,"stop":897.625,"duration":17.72},{"text":"Now, it's curious, though I suppose explainable because of the development of -- the recent development of cases like Shamel, but it's curious that it's almost impossible to find any indication in the decisions in this Court or elsewhere of the extent to which the police may take steps to preserve the status quo while warrants are being obtained.","start":897.625,"stop":931.65,"duration":34.02},{"text":"Back, a generation ago in Taylor against the United States, this Court pointed out that “a short
