these issues, I have filed in behalf of the amicus two briefs in this case and I would now like to make this brief supplementary argument.","start":648.807,"stop":659.054,"duration":10.25},{"text":"I want a dwell on the issue that was preserved in the Leary case last term, the resolution here, the constitutionality under the due process clause of the statutory presumption in 21 USC Section 174 with respect to hard narcotics.","start":659.054,"stop":674.598,"duration":15.54},{"text":"Then time permitting, I would like to point briefly to the other arguments post in the briefs of the amicus.","start":674.598,"stop":681.746,"duration":7.15},{"text":"The Leary case invalidated the virtually identical statutory presumption in 21 USC 176 (a) similarly involving a statutory influence arising from mere possession of foreign importation and knowledge thereof with respect to marijuana and it has specifically left for a future case separate consideration of the similar question with respect to hard drugs.","start":681.746,"stop":706.465,"duration":24.72},{"text":"Subsequent to the Leary case and in response to the briefs filed in this case, the Government has conceded error with respect to the drug cocaine and has prayed for reversal on count three.","start":706.465,"stop":718.378,"duration":11.91},{"text":"By so doing, it is our position that the Government has now dissolved any line remaining after Leary between marijuana and hard drugs.","start":718.378,"stop":727.52,"duration":9.14},{"text":"Applying the task of that and prior cases to the drug heroin, the remaining drug in the petitioner's possession.","start":727.52,"stop":735.172,"duration":7.65},{"text":"21 USC Section 174 is embraced fully within the prohibition of the due process clause.","start":735.172,"stop":743.101,"duration":7.93},{"text":"This Court has always given deference to the ability of Congress to fashion evidentiary rules but that deference has always been based and set forth in the Top case on the congress's ability to see the facts of a particular case in broader relationship than that might -- that might be presented to the jury.","start":743.101,"stop":762.078,"duration":18.98},{"text":"It should be noted at the outset here, that what the Congress was doing in 1909 when it passed the import and export act with respect to narcotic drugs was working a total prohibition on the import and under domestic possession and use of heroin.","start":762.078,"stop":777.222,"duration":15.14},{"text":"It was not making a judgment of a common relationship of facts such as the Congress was doing in the statute which was involved in Gainey case and the Romano case 26 USC 5601 in which it was determining that because of the tendency of steels to be located in hidden places, that they are maybe assumed to be in relationship with regard to anyone who is found present thereat.","start":777.222,"stop":803.534,"duration":26.31},{"text":"Therefore, realizing that we must look behind the normal deference which is to be accorded to the Congress in these matters, we must apply to these presumptions the tests which have been most recently stated in Leary and which have been also stated in Tot, those tests are that there be a rational connection between the fact and evidence and the fact presumed there from.","start":803.534,"stop":828.276,"duration":24.74},{"text":"Based on a connection and common experience and capable of giving rise to substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from fact and evidence.","start":828.276,"stop":839.728,"duration":11.45},{"text":"If we apply this tests to the possession here in question both logically and empirically with respect to 21 USC 174, we must come to a conclusion that we cannot reach substantial assurance that there is a rational connection between the fact in evidence and the facts unlawful importation and knowledge thereof which the Congress would have the Courts presume.","start":839.728,"stop":867.151,"duration":27.42},{"text":"With respect to unlawful importation, there are at least four alternatives for the source of heroin in the possession of the petitioner.","start":867.151,"stop":876.24,"duration":9.09},{"text":"This morning, Mr. Straus made reference to the statute 21 USC Section 513 by which heroin and any other drug may in fact be lawfully imported to the United States.","start":876.24,"stop":888.58,"duration":12.34},{"text":"Lawfully imported for scientific purposes and for subsequent license, but I would want that if petitioner Turner and any other possessor of heroin had come in possession of such a drug without such a license, he could not be prosecuted under the statute.","start":888.58,"stop":905.43,"duration":16.85},{"text":"The second source would be lawful importation of source material and subsequent deviation and manufacture of that source material into heroin.","start":905.43,"stop":914.967,"duration":9.54},{"text":"The source material commonly acknowledged for heroin derived as it is ultimately from the opium poppy is raw opium and morphine.","start":914.967,"stop":923.633,"duration":8.67},{"text":"As I pointed out in my brief, there is also evidence which the Government does not contradict, indeed it confirms that codeine may also be a source for heroin.","start":923.633,"stop":936.425,"duration":12.79},{"text":"Using the Government's statistics which the Government has applied as the basis for concluding in this case that cocaine may in fact not be unlawfully imported to the United States, we come to a conclusion that there is a rather high potential of domestic manufacture of the heroin drug.","start":936.425,"stop":955.048,"duration":18.62},{"text":"The Government concedes both the possibility and the technical ease with which heroin maybe manufactured.","start":955.048,"stop":961.702,"duration":6.65},{"text":"The Government's reports mentioned efforts to manufacture heroin and moreover, the Government, both federal and state have attempted to prosecute people for the effort of manufacturing heroin from source materials otherwise present in the United States.","start":961.702,"stop":977.053,"duration":15.35},{"text":"Moreover, the recent concerns of the bureau of narcotics and drug abuse for cough syrups which have raw traces of codeine within them and for Paragor which contain opium suggest that the source material for the substance in the possessor of heroin's hands maybe as handy as the local supermarket or drugstore.","start":977.053,"stop":998.231,"duration":21.18},{"text":"The third element which I would suggest is present to vitiate the assurance of unlawful importation is that the opium poppy may have been grown in the United States.","start":998.231,"stop":1009.419,"duration":11.19},{"text":"Indeed, that prospect was itself the basis on which Congress passed the Narcotics Control Acts in the early part of the century.","start":1009.419,"stop":1017.522,"duration":8.1},{"text":"The Government has acknowledged that it is agriculturally possible to grow opium in the United States.","start":1017.522,"stop":1024.807,"duration":7.28},{"text":"Moreover, there is a regime of federal control and licensing over the opium poppy in the United States and there have been prosecutions reported which are cited in my brief for individuals who have attempted to grow that product.","start":1024.807,"stop":1039.799,"duration":14.99},{"text":"The Government moreover in its brief has also confirmed that there are instances where opium is grown today in the United
