Armsterdam","textObjs":[{"text":"The issue of admissibility of the confession is entirely the traditional one of voluntariness and for that reason it turns on all of the factual circumstances of the case.","start":108.214,"stop":122.561,"duration":14.35},{"text":"It is for that reason that in our brief I have tried you set forth in all of the detail that the Court might wish, the exact factual circumstances under which the confession was obtained.","start":122.561,"stop":138.29,"duration":15.73},{"text":"As I understand the state's position, in its brief, it initially asserts that it agrees with all of petitioner's factual statements.","start":138.29,"stop":152.588,"duration":14.3},{"text":"However, in the argument portion of its brief, it does make certain factual assertions with which we are in disagreement.","start":152.588,"stop":163.191,"duration":10.6},{"text":"There are half dozen of those and I mean to advert to them specifically in my presentation because I think the most important aspect of this case is the facts.","start":163.191,"stop":177.295,"duration":14.1},{"text":"We begin with what is clearly a major factor in the case and that is the petitioner's age.","start":177.295,"stop":188.23,"duration":10.94},{"text":"At the time of his detention, interrogation and confession, he was a 15-year old, to be exact, 15 years and four months old.","start":188.23,"stop":201.113,"duration":12.88},{"text":"The state of course does not contest that, but it does make three factual assertions in that regard which I wish to bring to the Court's attention.","start":201.113,"stop":212.545,"duration":11.43},{"text":"First, it characterizes the petitioner as above average, and indicates that he had an intelligence beyond his mere age.","start":212.545,"stop":224.602,"duration":12.06},{"text":"The state sights nothing in the record for either these propositions.","start":224.602,"stop":230.069,"duration":5.47},{"text":"The Court will find nothing in the record to support either of these propositions and as I take it, it is an inference of the respondent to run from nothing other than the fact that the petitioner managed the hold out for a goodly time under sustained police questioning.","start":230.069,"stop":250.236,"duration":20.17},{"text":"The second factual matter raised by the state in connection with the petitioner's individual characteristics is that he was as the state puts it, court wise or already placed in its brief a hardened juvenile criminal.","start":250.236,"stop":269.132,"duration":18.9},{"text":"Again, the record shows no such thing.","start":269.132,"stop":273.808,"duration":4.68},{"text":"The facts in this regard are set forth in our brief at page 46 in the footnote 59.","start":273.808,"stop":280.431,"duration":6.62},{"text":"The trial record here shows only that the petitioner previous to this detention and interrogation had been a probationer of the juvenile Court.","start":280.431,"stop":290.39,"duration":9.96},{"text":"It does not show what caused him to be a probationer of juvenile Court and it does not show what context, if any, he had had with the police incident to becoming a probationer for juvenile Court.","start":290.39,"stop":302.782,"duration":12.39},{"text":"There are however psychiatric reports in this record, one of which we advert to in that footnote which shows that as of a time three months prior to his detention, the only run ins that he had had with the police were a minor pilfering incidents, stealing flashlight and jacket from a car, a broken window incident and some misconduct at school.","start":302.782,"stop":327.769,"duration":24.99},{"text":"In reviewing the record for this argument, I notice that I omitted from that footnote that the same diagnostic report also indicates a charge of waywardness, whatever that may be, some time prior to 1953 when he would have been 11 or 12.","start":327.769,"stop":346.069,"duration":18.3},{"text":"Again, no indication is to whether he had dealings with the police in that connection and for the sake of completeness, I simply want to bring to the Court's attention that there's another psychiatric report made later after his present juvenile commitment in which under Sodium Amatol interviews and a Methedrine interview at the state diagnostic center.","start":346.069,"stop":369.956,"duration":23.89},{"text":"The petitioner also adverted to two additional contacts with the police, however, this came out under Amatol.","start":369.956,"stop":378.609,"duration":8.65},{"text":"It is quite unclear what these contacts were and there is no objective verification of this Amatol material.","start":378.609,"stop":386.869,"duration":8.26},{"text":"In any event, he hardly has shown by this record to be a hardened juvenile criminal.","start":386.869,"stop":392.358,"duration":5.49},{"text":"Finally, the state says that the petitioner was and I quote “familiar with the ability to take refuge in silence.”","start":392.358,"stop":408.608,"duration":16.25},{"text":"That is a carefully phrased statement to the extent that it seems to assert that there is anything in this record showing that the petitioner knew anything about his privilege against self-incrimination or his right to resist police questioning.","start":408.608,"stop":421.594,"duration":12.99},{"text":"It is again totally unfounded in the record.","start":421.594,"stop":425.929,"duration":4.33},{"text":"The only material cited by the state to support it is a statement that at one time the petitioner was in fact totally silent during five minutes of particularly sustained police questioning.","start":425.929,"stop":443.89,"duration":17.96},{"text":"No indication that he knew of his right to maintain and retain that silence.","start":443.89,"stop":449.493,"duration":5.6},{"text":"So, I think what we end up with in terms of the personality in nature of this petitioner is that he was simply a 15-year old boy.","start":449.493,"stop":458.744,"duration":9.25},{"text":"I cannot honestly claim that there is anything in the record indicating that he is subnormal, but I think there is certainly nothing in the record to indicate that he is super normal in any regard.","start":458.744,"stop":469.684,"duration":10.94},{"text":"We turn then to what happened to this 15-year old boy.","start":469.684,"stop":476.109,"duration":6.42},{"text":"First, it is undisputed that prior to the interrogation which lead to his confessions he was detained without access to friends, family, or an attorney for a 10-day period.","start":476.109,"stop":492.812,"duration":16.7},{"text":"Now, I am quick to admit that this detention has none of the aggravating trappings, that have sometimes attached the cases coming to this Court, no shuttling around from police station to police station in that sort of thing.","start":492.812,"stop":507.396,"duration":14.58},{"text":"He was simply detained in the juvenile home and he was questioned by the police on four occasions; one, immediately after his arrest then several days later after an intervening weekend when the police detention on him focused in connection with these cases, then as soon as a lie detector expert could be gotten and finally, several days later on the day in which he confessed.","start":507.396,"stop":532.071,"duration":24.68},{"text":"The important thing however, about that detention, there are I think two important things about the detention.","start":532.071,"stop":539.044,"duration":6.97},{"text":"First, it shows a very considerable callousness on the part of the police and the juvenile authorities and indicates that they were far more concern with their investigation than they were with this 15-year old's welfare and that of his family.","start":539.044,"stop":556.155,"duration":17.11},{"text":"He had been away from home prior to his arrest.","start":556.155,"stop":559.022,"duration":2.87},{"text":"His mother had called the police and had called the juvenile authorities and she had made continuing inquiries of them and had been assured that as soon as he was picked up he would be brought home.","start":559.022,"stop":570.991,"duration":11.97},{"text":"In fact, when he was picked up, he was detained for 10 full days and his mother never learned that he was in custody until the newspapers printed that he had confessed.","start":570.991,"stop":582.97,"duration":11.98},{"text":"Now, the state suggests and here is the fourth matter on which we are in factual disagreement that the reason why Monks never saw his parents during this period was that he didn't want them.","start":582.97,"stop":595.39,"duration":12.42},{"text":"Again, the record has absolutely no support for this proposition.","start":595.39,"stop":600.906,"duration":5.52},{"text":"It seems to be an inference from the fact that at the time of his arrest he was living away from home.","start":600.906,"stop":607.25,"duration":6.34},{"text":"However, as I have indicated, his mother had made steps to find him both through the police and through the juvenile authorities.","start":607.25,"stop":615.091,"duration":7.84},{"text":"They knew that very well and never got into touch with her, but if it were so that Monks was so far from his parents that he felt that not even that, not even his mother and his father could be called to help him in this situation.","start":615.091,"stop":633.957,"duration":18.87},{"text":"It seems to me that speaks not strength and not a factor which supported this boy in his ordeal with the police, but rather the converse.","start":633.957,"stop":646.963,"duration":13.01},{"text":"Passing from that aspect of the continued detention to another

Brennan, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Does it appear why they picked him up Mr. Armsterdam?","start":759.84,"stop":762.792,"duration":2.95}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony G. Armsterdam","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, he was arrested in connection with two unrelated purse snatchings to which he admitted immediately.","start":762.792,"stop":769.621,"duration":6.83},{"text":"However, he was being held from all appearances for questioning on these offenses because the police officers had their attention called immediately to a similarity of modus between the crimes.","start":769.621,"stop":781.227,"duration":11.61},{"text":"And on the Monday following the Saturday of his arrest, they began to question him on these two particular offenses.","start":781.227,"stop":787.472,"duration":6.25},{"text":"They applied to the juvenile Court for leave to do so, they were granted leave to do so and they began to do so.","start":787.472,"stop":792.725,"duration":5.25},{"text":"Now, here we come to perhaps one additional factual matter in which we're in disagreement with the state because we believe that the implication to him was obvious, that he simply had no right to refuse to answer police questions and that the police would persevere in holding him and questioning him until he broke and confessed.","start":792.725,"stop":812.105,"duration":19.38},{"text":"The state asserts in its brief that the police in fact gave petitioner warnings of his right to remain silent at one point.","start":812.105,"stop":822.572,"duration":10.47},{"text":"The state citation to support that assertion refers entirely to a warning given after the petitioner had been questioned on three days and during 12 hours on the 3rd day without any warning or caution of any sort from the police at any time.","start":822.572,"stop":846.352,"duration":23.78},{"text":"It is undisputed that he was never given any warning throughout the interrogation until he had twice orally confessed to the offenses.","start":846.352,"stop":856.815,"duration":10.46},{"text":"At that point and just prior to the formal transcription of statements, he was told we are going to ask you to make a voluntary statement which you may make or you may not make as you please and that is the sum total of the warnings on this record.","start":856.815,"stop":869.588,"duration":12.77},{"text":"I want to make absolutely clear that he did not know and was not told at any time anything contrary to the clear indication presented by the police continual questioning that he simply was going to have to answer.","start":869.588,"stop":883.429,"duration":13.84},{"text":"Now, I come then to the final critical date and time is very important.","start":883.429,"stop":893.609,"duration":10.18},{"text":"At 7 am he was up, before 7 am he was up because he had breakfast at 7.","start":893.609,"stop":899.143,"duration":5.53},{"text":"At, 10 am police questioning began.","start":899.143,"stop":902.416,"duration":3.27},{"text":"The confessions were completed and signed at 1 am the following day, 15 full hours after the interrogation began.","start":902.416,"stop":912.751,"duration":10.33},{"text":"Now, during this time, he was -- no, for one minute out of the presence of two or three police officers except when he was being interrogated by a polygraph operator, never, during these 15 hours did he see or speak to anybody other than his interrogators.","start":912.751,"stop":933.189,"duration":20.44},{"text":"The actual amount of direct interrogation of questioning of him is unclear as it always is in these cases, but by the police admissions, the minimum possible time that he could have been under direct questioning was six and a half or seven hours.","start":933.189,"stop":950.275,"duration":17.09},{"text":"And that account of the time leaves several unexplained gaps in the day as is invariable with testimony regarding to these -- regarding matters of this sort.","start":950.275,"stop":960.631,"duration":10.36},{"text":"What is very important is that this record makes clear as no other record I have ever seen in this Court, what was going on throughout the 15 hours because it is misleading to imagine that only six and a half of that or seven of that involved investigation or interrogation?","start":960.631,"stop":977.678,"duration":17.05},{"text":"The point is that throughout the entire 15-hour period he was subject to the stresses and pressures of the interrogative process.","start":977.678,"stop":985.581,"duration":7.9},{"text":"While he was not being questioned, he was being confronted with his friends who were brought in to say that he had made admissions to them.","start":985.581,"stop":993.232,"duration":7.65},{"text":"They were undergoing polygraph testing while he waited outside the room to see what the result of that testing would be.","start":993.232,"stop":999.501,"duration":6.27},{"text":"He was driven around to the scene of the offenses.","start":999.501,"stop":1004.077,"duration":4.58},{"text":"He was told to sit and wait while the police officers left him, went across the room and in his presence discussed what they were going to do next.","start":1004.077,"stop":1016.141,"duration":12.06},{"text":"All of this time he was undergoing ongoing process of police interrogation.","start":1016.141,"stop":1021.843,"duration":5.7},{"text":"So that the 15 hours I think have to be seen as a block under which this 15 year old boy was subjected to the interrogative process and all of its pressures.","start":1021.843,"stop":1035.089,"duration":13.25},{"text":"What is equally important is that he persisted from the very beginning in denying these offenses.","start":1035.089,"stop":1044.503,"duration":9.41},{"text":"This is not one of these threshold confessions by anyone.","start":1044.503,"stop":1048.559,"duration":4.06},{"text":"The inquiry here is whether he voluntarily confessed, whether he willfully
