Act.","start":397.618,"stop":410.432,"duration":12.81},{"text":"The respondent's argument in the case seems to be essentially predicated upon the statement that since Section 10 (e) of the Act, confers upon the Court of Appeals to review decision of the National Labor Relations Board that that discretion is a broad one and that the Court below properly exercised this broad discretion in dismissing this case on the grounds of mootness.","start":410.432,"stop":443.335,"duration":32.9},{"text":"Now, as preface to my argument and if the Court will grant me permission, I would like to

and it was handed down after the briefs on behalf of the Government were filed.","start":468.292,"stop":481.656,"duration":13.36},{"text":"And that's your case NRLB versus Rutter-Rex.","start":481.656,"stop":485.692,"duration":4.04},{"text":"The reason why we file it is that the Supreme Court, this Court, very clearly and concisely set what it had set before and that is to say that the remedial powers of the National Labor Relations Board are broad.","start":485.692,"stop":501.735,"duration":16.04},{"text":"It's a broad discretionary power and they are subject to but limited review.","start":501.735,"stop":510.277,"duration":8.54},{"text":"And I think that this case -- this recent decision of this Court in the opinion of the Government is practically dispositive of the argument of the respondent company here.","start":510.277,"stop":521.111,"duration":10.83},{"text":"Because the only way the respondent company can get to this point is to say that Section 10 (e) confers upon the Court of Appeals.","start":521.111,"stop":529.107,"duration":8},{"text":"They brought very broad discretionary power in their review boarders of the National Labor Relations Board.","start":529.107,"stop":537.508,"duration":8.4},{"text":"The best example of that, I think is the decision of this Court in National Labor Relations Board versus Mexia Textile which was handed down by this Court in 1949.","start":537.508,"stop":551.706,"duration":14.2},{"text":"In that case, the issue was whether not the Board could go to the Court of Appeals to enforce its order, even if the respondent employer had voluntarily complied with the order of the Board.","start":551.706,"stop":564.067,"duration":12.36},{"text":"And the issue was raised to the Court of Appeals that there's no reason for you to consider this matter any longer.","start":564.067,"stop":570.118,"duration":6.05},{"text":"The Board said that we engaged in illegal activity in conduct, we agreed with it, we have complied with it, so why haven't order the Board enforcing conduct that we've already complied with or corrected.","start":570.118,"stop":581.616,"duration":11.5},{"text":"The Supreme Court and this Court, I think correctly held that since this kind of conduct can't be continuing in nature, the merely showing of compliance and voluntary or not by the employer with it and anyone given point of time, should not be a bar to the Board's right to get an enforcement order, so that it would have available to it, a contempt citation and order in the event the employer came along subsequent to its voluntary compliance and engaged in similar conduct.","start":581.616,"stop":613.173,"duration":31.56},{"text":"I think also whether the decision to Court which go to the whole question of mootness bring to bare the essential problem that's involved in this case.","start":613.173,"stop":624.141,"duration":10.97},{"text":"As this Court has held and in the United States versus W.T. Grant Company, you should not dismiss a case on the grounds of mootness until only there's reasonable expectation that there will never be a reoccurrence of the wrong again, that there's a strong burden imposed upon the wrong doer to come forward and show that regardless of our intent or the circumstances that it's likely that the conduct would never occur again.","start":624.141,"stop":653.209,"duration":29.07},{"text":"And I think again as this Court has held in Walling versus Reuter, this is true, so that the courts or the administrative boards and agencies can always have in its hit pockets so to speak the arrow to its bow of a contempt citation issued by a Court in the event the wrong doer commits the wrong again.","start":653.209,"stop":677.017,"duration":23.81},{"text":"And then finally of course just from the stand point of public policy in the administration of the Act and I think at this point that Court should be primarily concerned about because if you take the respondents argument that at first blush, he would make the Court believe either way that there is something integral and indigenous about Section 8 of the Act leading with unfair labor practice conduct to the one end and Section 9 of the Act which deals with representation elections.","start":677.017,"stop":712.365,"duration":35.35},{"text":"Section 7 of the Act guarantees to employees the right to engage in the concern of the activities for their mutual aid and protection, and I think that this guarantee of Section 7 of the Act encompasses several portions of the balance of the Act.","start":712.365,"stop":728.624,"duration":16.26},{"text":"One of them of course is the representation election.","start":728.624,"stop":732.051,"duration":3.43},{"text":"Employees under this act have a right to a free environment, the Board has set, I think many times that ask ideally under the laboratory conditions that the Board would like to see exist, to organize among themselves, to designate a union as their collective bargaining agent, to have representation election whereby such a bargain agent can be certified.","start":732.051,"stop":761.524,"duration":29.47},{"text":"But this right that is conferred upon employees in terms to self-organization is a distinct separate right under the Act in terms of its policies then the provisions that are contained in Section 8 of the Act that deal with unfair labor practice activity.","start":761.524,"stop":779.867,"duration":18.34},{"text":"One of the reasons why you have Section 8 of the Act is to give the Board and the courts a machinery by which you can create these so-called laboratory conditions, so that employees can make a free choice with respect to the selection of their collective bargain agent, and for the employer to come along as the respondent company has in this case to say the we'll really, they've had two or three shots to this election and they've lost it.","start":779.867,"stop":810.249,"duration":30.38},{"text":"And what we might have done with respect to the first one and it should be rendered moot, I think begs the question because all you have to do then is to permit employers to engaged in this kind of conduct and the union could have three or four, or five, or six elections and the courts would never really have a means by which to stop the yearly go activity in conduct.","start":810.249,"stop":832.181,"duration":21.93}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R. White","textObjs":[{"text":"But you, Mr. Attorney General, you seem to agree that if a Court determined there is no really substantial chance of the conduct ever being repeated that it could be dismissed as a moot.","start":832.181,"stop":849.226,"duration":17.04}]},{"speakerName":"Richard G.
