Friedman Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.","start":35.259,"stop":39.792,"duration":4.53},{"text":"Due to the intricate litigation, which is in the background of this case, and the complex factual setting as well as the unique procedural vehicle which was employed by the respondent Brotherhoods below, we will, with the Court's permission, make first a separate and distinct statement of the facts and of the procedural setting in this case, which will then be followed by Mr. Lyons's argument of the law as applied to those facts.","start":39.792,"stop":73.945,"duration":34.15},{"text":"First to the background and the physical setting which we're dealing with; Physically, we are dealing with the property of three separate railroad carriers.","start":73.945,"stop":85.593,"duration":11.65},{"text":"First, the Florida East Coast Railway; The Florida East Coast property is located in large part to the south of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida, although, it is bounded on the north by the north bank of the St. Johns River.","start":85.593,"stop":104.472,"duration":18.88},{"text":"The second parcel of the property we are dealing with is located to the north of the FEC property, and that property is of the Jacksonville Terminal Company.","start":104.472,"stop":115.207,"duration":10.74},{"text":"Thirdly, the property which is directly involved here is the Moncrief Yard located again north of the Jacksonville Terminal Company.","start":115.207,"stop":126.007,"duration":10.8},{"text":"By way of background and in highly capsule form if I may, in January, 1963, the FEC non-operating employees went on strike and began to picket the FEC property.","start":126.007,"stop":142.943,"duration":16.94},{"text":"In May of 1966, these pickets moved up the land and across the St. Johns River and began to picket the Jacksonville Terminal Company.","start":142.943,"stop":153.416,"duration":10.47},{"text":"Two series of litigation resulted from that picketing, both of which came before this Court.","start":153.416,"stop":160.303,"duration":6.89},{"text":"First, the Jacksonville Terminal Company sought an injunction and was granted an injunction in Federal Court.","start":160.303,"stop":167.092,"duration":6.79},{"text":"That injunction was reversed due to the Bar of Norris-LaGuardia by the Fifth Circuit and this Court affirmed full forward.","start":167.092,"stop":174.872,"duration":7.78},{"text":"Secondly, the Jacksonville Terminal Company sought an injunction in the state court.","start":174.872,"stop":179.79,"duration":4.92},{"text":"That injunction was granted and in March of last year, this Court reversed by a four- three decision.","start":179.79,"stop":188.594,"duration":8.8},{"text":"In the meantime however, and in April, 1967, the FEC pickets again moved up the land and placed pickets around the ACL's Moncrief Yard.","start":188.594,"stop":205.479,"duration":16.89},{"text":"Moncrief Yard, the facility which is involved in this case is a wholly-owned piece of property or a piece of property wholly owned by the ACL which is devoted primarily to classification and secondarily to the interchange of traffic with connecting carriers.","start":205.479,"stop":226.149,"duration":20.67},{"text":"Classification as the term implies is the simple act of breaking down a road train which comes in to the yard, putting it into its separate classes and putting it in a road train which goes out of the yard, it comes in ACL and goes out ACL.","start":226.149,"stop":243.661,"duration":17.51},{"text":"The interchange procedure, which is used by FEC and ACL in Moncrief Yard is also quite similar.","start":243.661,"stop":250.481,"duration":6.82},{"text":"The FEC with its locomotives and employees bring cars across the St. Johns River north, across the Jacksonville Terminal Company, and drop them on a previously designated track in Moncrief Yard.","start":250.481,"stop":264.881,"duration":14.4},{"text":"And on occasions, they pick up cars from Moncrief Yard and take them back to their own classification yard south of the river, back on the yard.","start":264.881,"stop":274.378,"duration":9.5},{"text":"The operating procedure which exists as to Moncrief Yard as well as the relationship between ACL and FEC is, we respectfully submit, totally distinguishable from the situation which existed in the case decided by this Court in March of last year.","start":274.378,"stop":295.312,"duration":20.93},{"text":"In the first place, the FEC owns no part of the ACL stock or no part of ACL property.","start":295.312,"stop":304.275,"duration":8.96},{"text":"Secondly, the FEC obviously owns no part of Moncrief Yard and had no interest, ownership wise in Moncrief Yard.","start":304.275,"stop":312.183,"duration":7.91},{"text":"The FEC exercises no discretion in either the overall management of ACL or in the management and operation of Moncrief Yard.","start":312.183,"stop":322.263,"duration":10.08},{"text":"The ACL does not maintain or repair any FEC cars and engines, And very importantly, we submit in this case, no FEC employee reports to or leaves from work at the picketed premises Moncrief Yard.","start":322.263,"stop":341.405,"duration":19.14},{"text":"The 1967 picketing, which is in issue here, took place at the ACL employee entrance into Moncrief Yard.","start":341.405,"stop":352.965,"duration":11.56},{"text":"The request, which was made by picket signs, pamphlets and apparently by telephone calls during the night was for ACL employees to go to work, but refuse to perform the functions which they normally perform in that yard, namely classify and interchange cars which are the sole property of ACL.","start":352.965,"stop":374.313,"duration":21.35},{"text":"There are at least three points which we believe should be made insofar as the picketing is concerned.","start":374.313,"stop":381.34,"duration":7.03},{"text":"First, there's no relationship between the picketing, which took place at Moncrief Yard in the presence of FEC in that yard.","start":381.34,"stop":391.95,"duration":10.61},{"text":"Secondly, the intent of the Brotherhood is obvious and was expressed by the highest official insofar as the strike is concerned, and that is to close the ACL because the ACL was doing business with the FEC.","start":391.95,"stop":406.552,"duration":14.6},{"text":"Thirdly, picketing was designed to force ACL employees to quit performing work, which they normally did for the ACL.","start":406.552,"stop":418.911,"duration":12.36},{"text":"As to the relationship between the picketing and the FEC presence in the yard, there was no relationship in time between the picketing and the FEC presence in the yard.","start":418.911,"stop":429.976,"duration":11.06},{"text":"They picketed when the ACL employees came to work and this was not necessarily at all at the time when FEC employees or engines might be in Moncrief Yard.","start":429.976,"stop":441.275,"duration":11.3},{"text":"There was no relationship in effect.","start":441.275,"stop":443.914,"duration":2.64},{"text":"The effect of this picketing was to cause ACL employees to cease to handle ACL cars and in many instances, cars which were never –- or never originated or were not destined to FEC.","start":443.914,"stop":460.105,"duration":16.19},{"text":"Separation is practical in this case.","start":460.105,"stop":463.109,"duration":3},{"text":"There are more than one place at which these FEC employees could be picketed and the intent was expressed by the head Brotherhood man insofar as this strike is concerned, and I quote from the appendix at page 31, “He was going to shut down the coastline railroad.","start":463.109,"stop":486.774,"duration":23.67},{"text":"” It was in this factual situation that the rather unique procedural complexity arose.","start":486.774,"stop":496.963,"duration":10.19},{"text":"First in 1967, the ACL filed a complaint in Federal Court based solely on Federal law and sought a temporary restraining order.","start":496.963,"stop":508.249,"duration":11.29},{"text":"That motion or request for a temporary restraining order was denied on the grounds of the Bar of Norris-LaGuardia.","start":508.249,"stop":516.058,"duration":7.81},{"text":"This action lay dormant from April 26, 1967 to May 23, 1969.","start":516.058,"stop":525.149,"duration":9.09},{"text":"Subsequently, the ACL filed suit in the state court, requesting an injunction solely under state law, that injunction was granted.","start":525.149,"stop":537,"duration":11.85},{"text":"In March, 1969, this Court handed down its opinion in Trainmen versus Jacksonville Terminal and it's the chronology of subsequent events with which this Court is primarily concerned today.","start":537,"stop":550.162,"duration":13.16},{"text":"First, the Brotherhood moved to dissolve the state court injunction, which had been handed down in 1967 and noticed a hearing for May 23, 1969.","start":550.162,"stop":561.51,"duration":11.35},{"text":"Virtually, while this hearing was going on in state court, on the Brotherhood motion to dissolve the injunction, a handwritten answer was filed by the Brotherhood in the dormant Federal Case, and a copy of that answer is found in the appendix at page 163.","start":561.51,"stop":584.309,"duration":22.8},{"text":"A second full hearing on the merits was held in State Court and Judge Lackey then issued a letter opinion which indicated that he would deny the Brotherhood's motion to dissolve the state court injunction.","start":584.309,"stop":598.216,"duration":13.91},{"text":"It was then that the Brotherhood filed a motion in the dormant federal case in Federal Court requesting that the federal district judge in effect enjoin the state court from enforcing its injunction.","start":598.216,"stop":614.361,"duration":16.14},{"text":"And the grounds of the motion were, and I quote from the appendix at page 186, to enjoin ACL from availing itself of the state court injunction “pending final hearing and determination of this [the federal action].","start":614.361,"stop":633.469,"duration":19.11},{"text":"” The ACL attempted to have the federal action finally determined and in fact, immediately filed a notice of dismissal.","start":633.469,"stop":641.395,"duration":7.93},{"text":"The ACL stated in open court that it was willing to have its complaint and its case dismissed with prejudice.","start":641.395,"stop":649.83,"duration":8.44},{"text":"The Brotherhood objected to a dismissal with prejudice, even though they had not in their handwritten answer sought any affirmative or counter relief, and the challenged order was entered on June 19, 1969, which one; denied the ACL the right to dismiss its complaint with prejudice and two; enjoined the state court from enforcing the 1967 injunction pending final hearing, in a case in which we respectfully submit there was nothing left to finally hear.","start":649.83,"stop":688.075,"duration":38.25},{"text":"We did however seek a final hearing and we were denied a final hearing and it is subsequent to that that we felt these appellate proceedings were commenced.","start":688.075,"stop":698.717,"duration":10.64},{"text":"In conclusion as to the facts and the procedural setting which gave rise to this case, we would respectfully submit that the procedural vehicle of a federal district judge enjoining a state court used by the Brotherhood in this case is unique and does constitute a serious and we believe a grave threat to continued federal state judicial relationships.","start":698.717,"stop":730.88,"duration":32.16},{"text":"The ACL sought injunctive relief in federal court in 1967, and that relief was denied because the Court was barred from acting under Norris-LaGuardia.","start":730.88,"stop":742.607,"duration":11.73},{"text":"The Brotherhood did not and has never sought any counter or affirmative relief in that case, and the federal court did not determine and could not determine the legality of the picketing in 1967.","start":742.607,"stop":757.397,"duration":14.79},{"text":"Subsequently, the Brotherhood contends that somehow, the district –- the Federal District Court in negatively denying the ACL's requested relief, affirmatively determined that the picketing was legal.","start":757.397,"stop":773.954,"duration":16.56},{"text":"It was not however until after the Brotherhood had failed to prevail in state court on its motion to dissolve the state court injunction that the Brotherhood took steps to enjoin the state court to “protect” the jurisdiction of the federal court.","start":773.954,"stop":793.71,"duration":19.76},{"text":"We respectfully submit that the intent was obvious and the effect was obvious, and that was to subvert the appellate processes of the state of Florida, avoid normal appellate procedures in the state of Florida, and to seek directly a review of a state court circuit judge decision by a federal district judge.","start":793.71,"stop":817.411,"duration":23.7},{"text":"And it is that error legally, which with the Court's permission, Mr. Lyons will commence discussing at this time, thank you.","start":817.411,"stop":833.611,"duration":16.2}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.
