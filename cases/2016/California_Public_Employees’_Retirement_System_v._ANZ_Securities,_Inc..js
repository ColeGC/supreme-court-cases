The other side has a tendency to invoke the phrase \"statute of repose,\" which isn't really self-defining in the phrase, in no event, when there's more going on in the statute than that, so I thought I would just start with the text, and it begins, \"no action\" -- and action is going to be the important noun here. \"No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under Section 11 unless brought\" -- and that's going to be the operative thing that has to happen -- \"within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\" The three-year period will follow in the next sentence, but we can pause here for just a second because it teaches a lot.

Now, the second sentence says, and it's the one at issue in the case before you, \"in no event shall any such action,\" referring to the one in the previous sentence, \"be brought to enforce a liability created under Section 11 more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public.\" And so what happens, we believe, is that just as the action was brought by the class action complaint within one year, it was also brought within necessarily three years.","start":107.29,"stop":160.28,"duration":52.99},{"text":"It was brought and it was brought on our behalf.

Now, if you contrast that with the Clayton Act at issue in American Pipe, there -- we can quibble about whether the language was as emphatic, but importantly, that language itself was -- was suspended or tolled if there was a government enforcement action. And what this Court held, at least as I read American Pipe, is that we know that was a statute of limitations because it was subject to tolling in at least one circumstance. And what this Court said in the Wallberger case, of course, is, when you have a time limit that's subject to tolling, that's a hint that it's a statute of limitations because the defining feature of a statute of repose that makes it different from a statute of limitations is that it's not subject to tolling or estoppel. And since American Pipe was emphatically a rule of tolling, the Court used the word \"tolling rule,\" \"toll,\" \"tolling\" at least a dozen times in the opinion. That tolling rule simply does not apply to a statute of repose like Section 13.
