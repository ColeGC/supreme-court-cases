The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any 'court of competent jurisdiction,' State or Federal.\" The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to say that you don't get to go to any Federal court or any State court, but rather, you have to choose a court, State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to examine the statutes creating that court and granting it jurisdiction.","start":31.26,"stop":73.91,"duration":42.65}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Does that include -- you -- you said subject-matter jurisdiction, but \"is this court competent to hear this controversy\" would include personal jurisdiction as well, or are you limiting it to subject-matter jurisdiction?","start":73.91,"stop":91.19,"duration":17.28}]},{"speakerName":"E.
