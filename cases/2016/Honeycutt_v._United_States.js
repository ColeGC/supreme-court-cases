So I -- I think that the reason the government's theory doesn't work is that it's just inconsistent with these background principles, because we just think that the relevant background principles are the ones governing, number one, forfeiture, and number two, sentencing, and neither of those background principles attributable in either of those areas support joint-and-several liability. So first as to forfeiture, as I think the government agrees, the relevant historical tradition is in rem forfeiture and there's just no concept of joint-and-several liability there.","start":401.505,"stop":434.605,"duration":33.1}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"I have just a practical question.","start":434.605,"stop":436.46,"duration":1.85}]},{"speakerName":"Adam G.

So we point out that Walter and Daniel Pinkerton, it's true that they were substantively liable for crimes committed by their co-conspirator, but had individual fines and individual sentences.","start":661.13,"stop":687.155,"duration":26.02},{"text":"And that's just part of the traditional principle of sentencing, that it's tied to an individual's culpability.","start":687.155,"stop":692.605,"duration":5.45},{"text":"So it doesn't make sense that one person's payment would be reduced based on someone else's plea agreement, because that's not tied to his own personal culpability.
