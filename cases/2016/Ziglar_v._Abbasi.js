All of the judges below concluded that Plaintiffs' core theory is squarely foreclosed by Iqbal. But the Second Circuit majority then formulated its own list merger theory of liability, premising liability on the alleged decision of Attorney General Ashcroft to merge the New York list of detainees, which had not been fully vetted, with the INS list, thereby continuing the hold-until-cleared policy for detainees on both lists. Bivens' liability does not attach here for at least three reasons. First, the Bivens remedy should not be extended to national security and immigration policy decisions by senior officials in the wake of the September 11 attacks.","start":7.835,"stop":61.75,"duration":53.92},{"text":"If the damages remedy is to be imposed, it's for Congress, not this Court, to do so.

I think the easiest way for this Court to resolve this case is through the Iqbal pleading theory.

On the substantive due process claim, what we have is an -- a -- a facially-valid constitutional policy to -- to -- that could be applied to individuals with individualized suspicion of terrorism. And if you look at the allegations in the complaint, and these are paragraphs 61 and 65 of the complaint, all that is alleged is that Ashcroft and Mueller met regularly with a -- this is on page 274A of the appendix to the petition -- that in the -- and this is paragraph 61 -- that Ashcroft and Mueller met with a small group of officials to exert maximum pressure on the individuals arrested, and then in paragraph 65, on the next page, that the punitive conditions in which the MDC and class members were placed were the direct result of the strategy.

In that situation, he made the decision to subject the whole group to a hold-until-cleared policy until they could figure it out.
