Eisenhammer","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and it please the Court: I would like to make three initial points. First, what this case is about is whether the Petitioner may bring a Fourth Amendment claim for unlawful detention pursuant to legal process. Second, this case is not about whether the decision to prosecute is governed by due process, the Fourth Amendment, or any other amendment. And third, this case is not about whether there's some constitutional tort named malicious prosecution.  All we ask the Court to do is to affirm your numerous -- numerous suggestions made in Albright that the Fourth Amendment supports this cause of action, and bring the Seventh Circuit in line with all other -- with the Tenth Circuit ruling on this.","start":9.52,"stop":57.59,"duration":48.07}]},{"speakerName":"John G. Roberts, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, but you to get past the statute of limitations problem and to do that, you need to characterize it, as I understand it, as a malicious prosecution claim.  Otherwise, it's time-barred.","start":57.59,"stop":68,"duration":10.41}]},{"speakerName":"Stanley B. Eisenhammer","textObjs":[{"text":"What -- what I need what we need to do is determine the -- not the statute of limitations, which is two years, set by State -- State -- by the State, but the accrual period.  And in Wallace, the Court has said that we -- you normally look to, not the State law, but it's a Federal question, that you normally look in reference to the common law. And in Wallace, they did say that that would be malicious prosecution that does have as an accrual period favorable termination.","start":68,"stop":102.95,"duration":34.95}]},{"speakerName":"John G. Roberts, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"But favorable termination has nothing to do with the Fourth Amendment claim, right?  And whether your prosecution is just favorably terminated or not, the Fourth Amendment claim and, it seems to me, the accrual begins when your Fourth Amendment rights are violated with, say, an illegal search. Whether you eventually are convicted or acquitted, really, you have a claim for an illegal search if there's been an illegal search without regard to favorable termination.","start":102.95,"stop":133.64,"duration":30.69}]},{"speakerName":"Stanley B.

Then there's a pretrial suppression hearing.  The evidence is still fabricated, and he's still held for two more months.  Then there's a trial.  Evidence is still fabricated and he's convicted and he's held for six more months.  Then there's an appeal filed, and then suddenly they find out the evidence was fabricated and -- and the charges are dismissed.

One, you have a Fourth Amendment claim which they discuss, and that the only claim before them was based on the lie at the Gerstein hearing.  You have a Fourth Amendment claim, but it is already accrued; it accrued too early; it is untimely.

And then in the last paragraph it says, \"Once detention by reason of arrest turns into detention by reason of arraignment, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture.\" So it seems to me that twice, the Seventh Circuit says very clearly that you have this Fourth Amendment claim until arraignment or legal process, and after that, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture.

What the Court in context has read -- and by the way, this is consistent with past statements by the Seventh Circuit, the -- the fundamental statement the Court has made -- and this comes from Newsome, the 2001 decision from which this jurisprudence has blossomed in the Seventh Circuit -- relabeling a Fourth Amendment claim as malicious prosecution would not extend the statute of limitations.

Now, the question of whether or not malicious prosecution is the proper analogy, the answer is absolutely not, and Wallace tells us why not. Wallace tells us -- now, the Petitioner has shifted just slightly from a reliance on common law favorable termination, which is what most of the circuits on their side of the split have done.  This also goes, I think, to Your Honor's question and to your point. Most of the circuits on the other side of the split have used favorable termination, but they've done so by adopting it as part of the underlying four-element common law tort, and they think if that's what we're calling it, then it's going to have favorable termination. A smaller number have relied on an extension, a drastic extension, of this Court's decision in Heck.  And that's the request now made by the Petitioner in the reply brief, that Heck ought to be expanded to apply here. But Wallace was very clear.  Heck only applies -- the delayed accrual principle and the favorable termination element that comes with it apply only where you have an extant conviction.  And that doesn't exist here. The court went through a mental exercise. They said, look, if you can realize that you have a Fourth Amendment claim before you're convicted, if the elements can be in mind, you know you've been wronged in a Fourth Amendment way before you are convicted, then that is not a claim that is entitled to the delayed accrual principle of Heck. And the reason was very simple.  Because as this Court said in Gerstein, Fourth Amendment contemplates that you can have bad arrests and good convictions.  And nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment protects the innocent as well as the guilty.  And expanding Heck to apply the circumstance where all you have is an ex parte requirement, or finding rather, of probable cause, requiring that civil plaintiff to then prove vindication at the end of the day would close the door on a potential universe of Fourth Amendment claims and instances.","start":2116.045,"stop":2264.81,"duration":148.76}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"I think you can discrete claims.  One wrong is you never should have been arrested, so you have a Fourth Amendment claim for that.  Another wrong is they kept you in detention.

Scodro","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, Your Honor, just to sure that I've been clear, again, we do agree that the lie -- the second lie Your Honor has described, the lie before the magistrate, is actionable under the Fourth Amendment.  If the question is why then doesn't the accrual period run from when one is ultimately released, I would make a couple of points in response to Your Honor's question. First, Petitioner has been very careful not to make that argument.  Indeed, the continuing seizure idea would be inconsistent facially with the cert petition, which claimed they need the benefit of favorable termination to prevail.  They, of course, wouldn't need it if they were instead arguing for a period of a continuing seizure. Lower courts have rejected the notion of a continuing seizure, and they're not raising it here. And I think the reason may be twofold. The first is that it runs into -- it runs in the face of traditional accrual principles that this Court has said, cases like Ricks and others, that it's not the period of harm that matters for accrual purposes.  It's when one first experiences the harm and thereby has all the elements needed to proceed. And a case like Morgan, which was a hostile work environment case, is really the exception that proves the rule.  In many ways it tells us why or how narrowly the Court has -- has construed the exceptions to this typical accrual principle.  Hostile work environment does require precisely what Your Honor describes because it's impossible to know precisely when a hostile work environment begins.  Is it the second comment or the fifth or the tenth that someone has to endure in the workplace, and therefore, the Court is willing to consider it as a monolithic whole and treat it that way for accrual purposes. But again, that's the exception that proves the rule.  As Wallace itself concluded, there can be a cutoff, which Wallace imposed between the initial arrest and the post-process arrest, and Wallace itself in that regard, I think, breaks through the notion of a continuing seizure. The final point I would make -- and I think this comes out in one of their amicus briefs; namely, the brief by Professor Alexandra -- taken to its logical conclusion, the logic of continuing seizure may lead one to conclude that the seizure doesn't end until the ultimate period of incarceration concludes.  And what that means is now you have potential civil plaintiffs bringing claims 10, 15, 20 years down the road without any prior notice to the would-be defendants, no ability to maintain evidence and so forth.","start":2307.945,"stop":2470.11,"duration":162.16}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"Why do you need to evidence to somebody who's fabricated the reasons why you're in jail?  And -- and I don't know why you would think that it's important to cut off recovery against the police officer who bases an arrest solely on fabrication.  It doesn't seem so horrible to me.  Years later or immediately, if you've done something as untoward as that, as unconstitutional as that, why should it matter?","start":2470.11,"stop":2504.075,"duration":33.96}]},{"speakerName":"Michael A.

They've made the point that early notice to the State as employer of agents who are engaged in bad acts is extraordinarily important.  Government is intent upon learning sooner rather than later that they have individuals in their ranks that are violating the Constitution.
