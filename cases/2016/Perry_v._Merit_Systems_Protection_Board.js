Very often federal employees who have discrimination claims want to get reviewed before an administrative body, like the MSPB or the EEOC, because it's easier to litigate there. And so here, if -- if he goes to district court, and the district court says, the MSPB was right, you don't have an appealable action, you're not entitled to further proceedings in the MSPB, many employees in that circumstance might decide that they don't want to pursue further proceedings in the district court.","start":3258.89,"stop":3293.12,"duration":34.23},{"text":"They might decide, I want to go back and avail myself of my administrative remedies.

For the EEOC regulation, it's 29 C.F.R. 16 point -- 1614.302(a)(2), and from the MSPB perspective, it's 5 C.F.R. 1201.151(a)(1)","start":3353.2,"stop":3384.19,"duration":30.99},{"text":"So this is the government -- the agencies themselves actually interpret the statute just exactly the way we do.

And there will be -- unless you're to say, as the government seems to suggest, that the MSPB's views on what is jurisdictional is conclusive, and cannot be reviewed, if they say it's jurisdictional, it is jurisdictional, then this Court, presumably, and -- will be drowning for years in cases regarding whether or not a particular MSPB action was, in fact, properly characterized as procedural, substantive, or jurisdictional. I think our view has the simplicity of saying, if you made the allegations, regardless of the civil service action, regardless of whether or not the agency accepts those allegations, you have a mixed case, that goes to the district court just like procedural dismissals and just like substantive issues, and the district courts handle it.","start":3406.525,"stop":3457.96,"duration":51.43},{"text":"That's a simple regime for agents -- for affected government employees and agencies and courts to handle.
