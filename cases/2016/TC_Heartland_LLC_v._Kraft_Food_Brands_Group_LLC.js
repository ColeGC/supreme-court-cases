Well, that directly contradicts what they say on page 8 of their brief, which states, quote, \"The new -- Section 1391(c) now governs for all venue purposes.\" So the plain meaning of \"govern\" applies to 1391(c) by their own characterization.","start":495.41,"stop":544.45,"duration":49.04},{"text":"They're the ones who are saying that 1391(c) governs venue in this case, which is what they say on page 8, and then they try to do this acrobatic maneuver to escape the exceptions clause by saying it doesn't govern.","start":544.45,"stop":557.135,"duration":12.68},{"text":"Well, as we say in our reply brief, the plain meaning of \"govern\" means that 1391(c) is part of the sections that in the structure of 1391 is subordinated to the exception language.

Marvel and statutory precedence of this Court, it is as much a part of that statute as the words originally were, that that is part of the law that everyone agrees provides for a venue otherwise than what the Respondent is arguing for.
