And so what we think is enough to decide this case -- in fact, it's more than is necessary to decide this case -- is to say, when dealing with the elements of abuse, and the allegation is solely because of the ages of the partners engaging in sexual relations you have abuse, then 16 should be the age of consent.

In the categorical approach cases, starting with Taylor, when the Court had confronted a generic crime without a specific cross-reference definition, what the Court has done is look across the sweep of State laws and Federal laws criminalizing that conduct. In a case like Perrin, where there were 42 states that had a common core definition, the Court explicitly said in a footnote in that case there's no ambiguity involved in that situation, because we assume it's sufficiently clear that that's what Congress would have been intending to cover.

The Solicitor General acknowledges at page 42 of its brief that other clear statement rules and, of course, juris prudence, like the presumption against preemption, the presumption against retroactivity, come before you get to agency deference.

And, Justice, this is what Judge Wilkinson did for the Fourth Circuit in Rangel-Castenada which is cited in our briefs and we think that decision is correct. Even if what you did what the Solicitor General asked you to do, which is ignore all of that and simply pick up Black's Law Dictionary, as we've shown in our reply brief you end up in the same place, because Black's Law Dictionary, when it defines sexual abuse says that it -- we're talking about illegal sexual activity.","start":1172.89,"stop":1234.43,"duration":61.54},{"text":"And to define what is illegal you have to ask what the age of consent is, and when you look in Black's Law Dictionary, for the age of consent in this situation, you find the number 16.

And here that problem is taken care of in the State laws like -- in the states like California that have laws that reach up to 18, because as we've shown in Footnote 1 of our reply brief, all of those states have other statutory provisions that are in line with the Federal law or very close to it. So really, all you are dealing with this in this case is a few outlier -- there's actually seven outlier statutes that go further than the Federal aw, and that have backup provisions that are going to still allow the Federal government to seek automatic removal or some other immigration remedy against people that commit sexual offenses against minors.
