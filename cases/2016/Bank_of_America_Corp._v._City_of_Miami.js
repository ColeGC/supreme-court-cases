First, the answer can't be yes always, because that would eviscerate two key doctrines of this Court: Proximate cause and zone of interests. Second, the answer can't be no, never, because cities can identify concrete harms that fall within the zone-of-interests, such as discrete expenditures to combat a particular defendant's racial misconduct. And third, this lawsuit fails both the zone of interests and proximate cause, because the injury it seeks to remedy is unrelated to the Act's purposes, and because that injury is several steps removed from any alleged acts of Petitioners.
