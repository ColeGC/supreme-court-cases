The problem with the latter theory, that is, the provocation theory, as an excessive force matter, is -- there are multiple problems. The first is it imposes liability under Plaintiffs' approach for a new breed of constitutional tort, which is creating a dangerous situation without regard to whether it's a search or a seizure, or, under your scenario, Justice Sotomayor, even the Ninth Circuit's test, there is something very incongruous about holding an officer liable for a use of force that is not excessive at the moment at which it is used, and therefore is reasonable, and therefore, in compliance with the Fourth Amendment, and this goes --","start":241.565,"stop":300.66,"duration":59.1}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"That's where I have -- '","start":300.66,"stop":301.37,"duration":0.71}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"Can I --","start":301.37,"stop":302.21,"duration":0.84}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"I'm sorry.","start":302.21,"stop":302.66,"duration":0.45},{"text":"Go ahead.","start":302.66,"stop":303.04,"duration":0.38}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"Can I ask about the first theory, because you said if there was a violation -- excuse me -- of the knock-and-announce rule, and a death or an injury proximately caused by that violation, then there could be recovery.
