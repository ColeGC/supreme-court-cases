Number one, antisubrogation laws relate to benefits and coverage, as this Court concluded in FMC v. Holliday, and at the very least, they relate to payments with respect to benefits. Number two, if there's any ambiguity on this point, OPM's notice-and-comment regulation answers a question in favor of preemption. And number three, although the majority of the Supreme Court of Missouri thought otherwise, we believe there's no constitutional infirmity in Section 8902(m)(1) under the Supremacy Clause. If I could turn to my first point, it seems to us that the antisubrogation rule in this case is preempted for basically the same reasons this Court considered in FMC in concluding that the same rule was preempted under ERISA.","start":17,"stop":76.03,"duration":59.03},{"text":"That is to say that it effectively requires plan administrators to calculate benefits on the basis of different liability conditions that vary from State to State; that very importantly, it undermines the statute's goal of uniformity; and third, that it could encourage plan sponsors, in this case, the Federal government, to reduce the scope of coverage. In addition to those reasons, this statute gives you an additional reason to find that it is preempted, and that is that it also preempts those rules that relate to payments with respect to benefits. It is quite clear to us that the subrogation and reimbursement claims that are at issue in these rules quite plainly refer to and relate to payments with respect to benefits; and therefore, the Supreme Court of Missouri was wrong in overlooking that part of the statute and also wrong in overlooking your decision in FMC v. Holliday.","start":76.03,"stop":136.14,"duration":60.11}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Is there any -- any room at all for State regulation of carriers who have these contracts with OPM?","start":136.14,"stop":144.985,"duration":8.85}]},{"speakerName":"Miguel A.

Congress dealt separately in Section -- in Section 8909(f) with the subject of taxation in the context of these plans and generally provided that carriers may be subject to generally-applicable laws that are applicable to all businesses under profits and -- and the like, but that States, you know, may not tax, you know, the benefits and the payments. And so Congress has, in fact, crafted a limited preemption provision that singles out those laws that are most likely to apply to the insurance plans at issue, and then only say that the scope of the preemption will be defined by particular terms of the contract.","start":144.985,"stop":215.005,"duration":70.02},{"text":"And so in our view, in some ways, the reach of this law is somewhat more limited than the -- that of the ERISA statute because, although your \"relate\" language is identical and they should have identical scope with respect to benefits coverage and -- and payments with respect to benefits, it does not reach all laws of the State.","start":215.005,"stop":238.215,"duration":23.21},{"text":"It targets, to begin with, only the health insurance -- those laws that relate to health insurance or plans.

I think that context is extremely important to understand the Court's caveat as to the text of the statute, because the question then was will the statute would bear a construction that was expansive indeed with respect to an entirely different subject matter. With -- with respect to the question of whether the Court considered the statute as being susceptible on the merits of the defense to plausible alternative constructions, I think if you look at the relevant passage, what the Court said was that different constructions were being urged upon the Court; on the one hand, one by the United States, and on the other hand, another one by the Cruz plaintiffs out of the Seventh Circuit.
