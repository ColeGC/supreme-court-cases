A circumstance in which a claim has been discharged in a previous bankruptcy, a circumstance, in which a claim has in fact actually been paid off.","start":3446.31,"stop":3465.71,"duration":19.4},{"text":"A circumstance in which the claim is subject to a setoff, or a circumstance in which the creditor simply gets the wrong amount or the wrong person.","start":3465.71,"stop":3473.79,"duration":8.08},{"text":"These circumstances, I'm reliably informed, recur with some frequency in bankruptcy proceedings, and yet, in all of those circumstances, after an objection is raised and the claim is disallowed.","start":3473.79,"stop":3485.08,"duration":11.29},{"text":"There could be a claim that the claim itself was false or misleading under the FDCPA, and a holding in Respondent's favor would really be a recipe for clogging the courts with these sorts of FDCPA claims. And I would note, parenthetically, that to the extent the Respondent and the government's argument presupposes some absence of a good faith basis for believing that some of these objections are invalid. That's very hard to reconcile with the language of the FDCPA because if there is one established principle about the operation of the FDCPA, it is that there is no affirmative state of mind requirement.","start":3485.08,"stop":3520.63,"duration":35.55},{"text":"And so what Respondent and the government would be asking you to do is to say, sure, there could be a prima facie claim under the FDCPA, but the only way in which a creditor could escape liability would be to invoke the affirmative defense in Section 1692k paragraph c, where the violation is not intentional and results from a bona fide error which requires the maintenance of procedures reasonably calculated to avoid that error. And so, again, this is going to be a recipe for bringing these FDCPA actions into play, and many, many bankruptcies. And that leads me to my second point, which is that this Court has never applied the FDCPA within the four corners of a bankruptcy proceeding, and I think that the problem with doing so here is that it really doesn't address the principle concern that Respondent and the government raises, and let me give you an example as to why that's true. Suppose you have a bank that holds credit card debt, and that bank actually doesn't sell that debt on to a debt collector.","start":3520.63,"stop":3578.515,"duration":57.88},{"text":"Well, that bank could do the very same thing.","start":3578.515,"stop":3580.99,"duration":2.47},{"text":"It could file a proof of claim, it would be required to disclose that there is a prima facie limitations defense, and yet, if that bank does not qualify as a debt collector under the definition of the FDCPA.","start":3580.99,"stop":3593.03,"duration":12.04},{"text":"FDCPA liability would not be available, and that simply illustrates the fact that this is really a problem, if it is, in fact, a problem, with the operation of bankruptcy, and it's a problem that Congress or the advisory committee are -- are best situated to remedy, and so, for instance, if there is concern about the limitations defense, one solution is to eliminate the fact that that's a defense, and for Congress to shift the burden back on to the creditor.
