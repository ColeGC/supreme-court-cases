There's no pre-existing right to remain in the United States so a new ground of removal does not interfere with any pre-existing rights. In particular, there was no right to expect to be granted relief from deportation. So, even if a new ground, substantive ground, for removal would be retroactive, and this Court's opinions would refute that, certainly taking away a discretionary power in the Attorney General to grant relief in the future is in no way retroactive.
