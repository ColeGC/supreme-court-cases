Respondents offer no administrable rule that would support even the basic presence requirement that this Court recognized in Granholm was unquestionably legitimate, and no account of the history.

A durational residency requirement follows from that: first, because states get to define what residency is, and, second, because the same interests that serve a presence requirement also serve a durational -- durational residency requirement.

That is the exception that Granholm recognized to the state's virtually complete authority.
