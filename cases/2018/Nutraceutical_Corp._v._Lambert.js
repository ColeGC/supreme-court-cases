Dieter, it's based on a traditional and virtually unquestioned practice that is premised upon three main policy points: to prevent premature appeals, to develop and strengthen the record, and to respect the authority of the district court. It's important to realize that this doctrine could not open the door to equitable exceptions for claim processing rules because, in the Ibarra, Dieter, and Healy cases, those dealt with a statute, 3731, establishing the deadline in a criminal case, and, thus, it was a jurisdictional case.","start":94.03,"stop":137.87,"duration":43.84},{"text":"So the application of that rule in the context of a criminal case with jurisdictional rules, in fact, tolled those jurisdictional deadlines.","start":137.87,"stop":147.14,"duration":9.27},{"text":"And so, therefore, pursuant to the Court's holdings in Hamer and elsewhere, that is not an equitable exception.","start":147.14,"stop":156.9,"duration":9.76}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Hueston, given the reasons that you just stated for that rule, why is the rule limited to a motion for reconsideration that's filed during the 14-day window?

If that 30-day deadline were imposed in this case and one could file on the 30th day and begin tolling, that would render the 14-day deliberately small window that the advisory committee drafters created in order to minimize the disruption and delay in the context of class action cases a nullity because, in any instance where you would have a longer deadline for a motion for reconsideration, you could wait out that period and avoid the window that was intentionally created by the drafters. And I would like to direct the Court's attention specifically to the advisory committee notes to the 1998 amendment to Rule 23(f), where they specifically stated the importance of the short window to deliberately keep the time as short as possible.","start":178.85,"stop":251.99,"duration":73.14}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"It just seems as though the -- the exception that you admit, which is the exception for filing a motion for reconsideration within the 14-day period, also effectively renders that 14-day period a nullity, right, because it stops it in its tracks and then, once the motion for reconsideration has been dealt with, as I understand the agreement between the parties, the -- the clock goes all the way back to the beginning. So given that -- that what you -- the exception you admit renders the 14-day period a nullity, again, I just wonder why the exact same reasons, practices, traditions don't suggest that, for example, as in -- as -- as what -- the example you gave, if the motion for reconsideration is timely filed within 30 days, that as long as you do that, it should have the same effect.","start":251.99,"stop":303.29,"duration":51.3}]},{"speakerName":"John Hueston","textObjs":[{"text":"Justice Kagan, there is no doubt that if the motion for reconsideration is filed, for instance, on the 14th day, there would then be a longer period of time.","start":303.29,"stop":313.035,"duration":9.75},{"text":"But we must presume that the advisory committee considered that. And as I have thought about the timing, the 14 days creates a shorter window at which then is hooked the potentially later motion for reconsideration period. If we apply Lambert's rule and extend that out to 30 days or potentially longer, and in the Central District no deadline at all, it truly renders the 14-day period a nullity in that instance.

And that has been pointed out. But the Court in more recent decisions, particularly the Kontrick decision and the Eberhart decision, specifically cites Robinson as still good law, acknowledging, though, the term \"jurisdictional\" was misused, that, in fact, Robinson stands for, as Eberhart said, observing clear limits of the rules. So going back to the second part of your question, the Robinson case specifically addressed the issue that, well, if the Court has not addressed that second portion, an act that could be allowed, if we allowed a late filing, that would, in fact, eviscerate the first proscription and render, in fact, that portion of Rule 26(b) a nullity.","start":736.93,"stop":812.53,"duration":75.6}]},{"speakerName":"Neil Gorsuch","textObjs":[{"text":"So what work does that language then do to permit an act to be done after the deadline?","start":812.53,"stop":820.365,"duration":7.84}]},{"speakerName":"John Hueston","textObjs":[{"text":"And I --","start":820.365,"stop":821.13,"duration":0.76}]},{"speakerName":"Neil Gorsuch","textObjs":[{"text":"Why doesn't your interpretation itself render that language a nullity?","start":821.13,"stop":826.015,"duration":4.88}]},{"speakerName":"John Hueston","textObjs":[{"text":"And, Justice Gorsuch, I've been giving thought to that.","start":826.015,"stop":828.87,"duration":2.86}]},{"speakerName":"Neil Gorsuch","textObjs":[{"text":"I had hoped you might.
