Therefore, the only way that Wyoming's statehood could have terminated the hunting right is by implication, but that is the very theory that this Court repeatedly rejected in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians. And while the treaty does provide that the right would terminate if the lands were no longer unoccupied, President Cleveland's 1897 proclamation creating the Bighorn National Forest did not suddenly render all 1.1 million acres of the land comprising the forest occupied as the parties to the treaty understood that term. As a result, the treaty right has not terminated, and Petitioner should have been permitted to invoke that right during his criminal prosecution for hunting in the Bighorn National Forest. Before this Court, Wyoming largely disregards Mille Lacs and urges this Court to rely on its 1896 decision in Ward v. Race Horse.","start":38.28,"stop":97.2,"duration":58.92},{"text":"But Mille Lacs repudiated the reasoning that led to the outcome in Race Horse.","start":97.2,"stop":102,"duration":4.8},{"text":"From Race Horse's reliance on the equal footing doctrine to its characterization of treaty rights as temporary and precarious --","start":102,"stop":108.72,"duration":6.72}]},{"speakerName":"Neil Gorsuch","textObjs":[{"text":"But --","start":108.72,"stop":108.92,"duration":0.2}]},{"speakerName":"George W.
