But do you really have a problem if the manufacturer specifically directed that the product be used with an asbestos-containing material, where he knew that it was dangerous? That's one of the things they want to show. I don't see what your problem is with that, or, that the product was originally equipped with an asbestos-containing part that you could reasonably expect will be replaced, because simply, when people do replace things, they do tend to use the kind of equipment that was there before.","start":567.04,"stop":610.32,"duration":43.28},{"text":"What's wrong with that one? Now containing an -- I might -- the third one, I don't know, because there's conflict sort of within the restatement, so I thought maybe you should phrase it in your favor somewhat and say, well, he could be liable to where the manufacturer functionally requires, you see, he puts out a product that to work, that to work, you have to use the dangerous thing.
