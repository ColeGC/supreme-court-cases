But the two provisions that seem to me to create a lot of problems for your position are 15 U.S.A. -- 15 U.S.C. 1692a(6), which creates a special definition of \"debt collector\" for a purpose that's not relevant here, and that refers to any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.

So it doesn't make any sense to read that section -- it doesn't make any sense to read that section as limited to security enforcers when it only applies to people who might enforce security interests, but they're also collecting debts.
