Second, the -- the statute at least in Arkansas is disjunctive, right? It says a -- a place customarily used to -- to live, which might be your -- line up with the Tennessee statute and suggest some sort of customization or change.","start":387.28,"stop":417.44,"duration":30.16},{"text":"But then it uses \"lives in.\" And that doesn't connote any changes to the vehicle itself at all.","start":417.44,"stop":424.68,"duration":7.24},{"text":"That could be sleeping in the back of -- of a car, nothing more. And I wonder, under your interpretation, about this hypothetical, let's say someone breaks into such a car where someone's living, a homeless person or someone crossing the country, to steal a flip phone. That would be burglary, I -- I think you'd say, and the ACCA would kick in and 15 years might -- might follow as a sentence.

And that makes significant sense given that it was enacting a recidivism statute and, therefore, would want to cast its net broadly. And this, I think, takes me to Your Honor's first question, which is that, actually, the numbers work in exactly the opposite way, as you suggest. On Respondents' view, there would only be in 1986 -- and the numbers are similar today -- about 12 states in the entire country that would have any burglary offense whatsoever that qualified under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

So I think there are about 12 statutes that had \"lived in\" or some kind of similar language, but that's a subset of over 44 statutes that would have reached vehicles generally in which people lived that were adapted for overnight accommodation that were customarily used for overnight accommodation. And so I think what you see is that the states all sort of coalesced around this notion of what is a modern-day dwelling. And that makes particular sense because, as I began my presentation this morning, common law or, excuse me, burglary has always focused on dwellings.","start":557.48,"stop":590.84,"duration":33.36},{"text":"And so it is hardly surprising that a large number of states would have, over time, noticed and taken heed of the fact that people live in many different places and that burglary statutes, therefore, should protect all of those places.

One, I think the -- the definition -- the dictionary definition of \"lived\" would be to occupy as a home, and so we ordinarily would see some type of change to the structure. Two, there is no state case, whether in Arkansas or in any other jurisdiction, that has similar language actually applying the statute to the home in which someone lives without any modification or really to a vehicle at all. And, three, I think if you look at the two parts of the statute, as I believe Justice Gorsuch was noting earlier, one prong says \"customarily used,\" and we think that that's something that is commonly used, perhaps because it's designed for overnight accommodation, and the other is someplace where someone lives.","start":645.36,"stop":690.72,"duration":45.36},{"text":"And we think that that brings in sort of the -- the adapted in this particular case.

And if Congress is dissatisfied with the outcome, it's obviously fully able to pass the law that's pending, and the department, even if it hasn't taken a firm position, can take a position and get something done. But we think if the Court goes out of its way again to do something more extravagant in these cases, you're going to potentially own this jurisprudence a lot longer.","start":3057.32,"stop":3093.2,"duration":35.88},{"text":"And that's what -- really what's happening here. The reason these cases are in front of you, you may know this already, but the reason these cases are in front of you are because after the invalidation of the residual clause the government is going around and making a bunch of arguments that it didn't make before, trying to get in various prior state convictions that it wasn't arguing for under the enumerated clauses or under the use of force clauses.","start":3093.2,"stop":3112.84,"duration":19.64},{"text":"That's why you have this new explosion of ACCA cases.

But we ask, for all the reasons I've asked before, not to accept the government's argument to \"adapted.\" The only thing the government has to say for itself, Justice Sotomayor, and I may be repeating myself here, is the state-by-state count.","start":3139,"stop":3167.96,"duration":28.96},{"text":"We think the state count is answered by the flow of this Court's jurisprudence and the other things in Taylor, things like adhering to the '84 Congressional intent, adhering to the most important thing perhaps, which is just sweeping in violent offenders. Mr. Chief Justice, you talked about people using guns.","start":3167.96,"stop":3184.12,"duration":16.16},{"text":"You know, that would be the quintessential case.","start":3184.12,"stop":3185.8,"duration":1.68},{"text":"Of course, Congress drew it a little bit more broadly, a risk of physical injury, but for all the reasons I've argued and we've shown in our briefs, the outer limits of the Tennessee law, even on its own terms, covers these kinds of cases that, as I said to Justice Breyer earlier, are a one-in-700 chance of physical injury. And in those kinds of cases, we don't think Congress would have expected a state law to -- to be swept up into ACCA.","start":3185.8,"stop":3209.4,"duration":23.6},{"text":"And I would hasten to add that I think this is also responsive, Justice Breyer, you asked about how these cases are charged. When there are the kinds of altercations that Justice Alito, for example, was -- was hypothesizing, somebody is in inside and there is a violent altercation, those cases aren't charged as burglary.","start":3209.4,"stop":3224.92,"duration":15.52},{"text":"They're charged as things like carjacking, robbery, assault. So the burglary convictions, and this is what the Sentencing Commission found when it backed burglary out of even the crime of violence provisions in the Sentencing Guidelines, it found that when burglary is charged, it's in the cases where nothing happened but the entry. And so that may well still satisfy the categorical definition of burglary under ACCA, the residential entry, because of the awareness and because of the inherent risk, but once you go beyond primary residences and talk about things that are hardly ever occupied and that people are going to target specifically because they're hardly ever occupied, walking down to the -- to the -- to the marina with a sleepy sailboat on the dock and rummaging through the contents, those are the kinds of things that Congress, I don't think, would have expected to be swept up and any sensible definition of ACCA wouldn't trigger the harsh consequences that follow.

I just want to make a few points.","start":3287.36,"stop":3293.96,"duration":6.6},{"text":"The first is that Justice Gorsuch suggested that perhaps my friend on the other side would quibble with our numbers with respect to how many states would have ACCA burglary and how many wouldn't under our view and under Respondents' view. And my friend has not actually quibbled with those numbers.","start":3293.96,"stop":3307.96,"duration":14},{"text":"He agrees that, at most, we're looking at 12 states with ACCA burglary under his view. And I think that that is itself, if not dispositive, very close to it because, again, we -- we don't think that's a statute that Congress would have passed. Now my friend has a couple of reasons why Congress might have done that.","start":3307.96,"stop":3324.24,"duration":16.28},{"text":"He says, well, really the delta's only 20 or so cases -- or 20 or so states, but those 20 states make the difference between the definition of ACCA burglary, satisfying what this Court said four times over in Taylor, that it was trying to get at the way that the states used the term \"burglary,\" the majority of states.","start":3324.24,"stop":3341.72,"duration":17.48},{"text":"It said that with respect to the 1984 statute, with respect to the 1986 statute, as a reason for rejecting the common law definition, and when it introduced the categorical approach and said that a few state statutes might be broader than the definition that it was adopting. So those 20 state statutes, I think, really cannot be underestimated here. The other reason that my friend gave for why the numbers are so low is that Mathis changed everything, but Mathis didn't change everything.","start":3341.72,"stop":3365.56,"duration":23.84},{"text":"As Mathis itself would explain, Mathis interpreted this -- the ACCA as it always stood.","start":3365.56,"stop":3370.48,"duration":4.92},{"text":"And so I don't think that Congress when it enacted the statute in the first instance would have expected about 12 state laws to come in as burglary. Another thing that my friend mentioned was the residual clause.","start":3370.48,"stop":3380.84,"duration":10.36},{"text":"Again, I don't think that when Congress enacted a statute with the word \"burglary\" and then with the residual clause, which we know was an attempt to expand the scope of the statute to reach other crimes, that it, in fact, would have meant for most burglary statutes or a substantial number of burglary statutes to come in through the residual clause while narrowing the point or the -- the word \"burglary\" to essential obsolescence. So, given the way that the state statutes play out here, we think that our reading is the one that is consistent with what Congress was -- was trying to do and with Taylor itself. Now, speaking in terms of Taylor, my friend mentioned that Taylor said that the definition that it was taking on was practically identical to the 1984 definition and that that definition only included buildings. What I think -- I apologize, I don't remember exactly who said it -- someone had mentioned, one of the Justices had mentioned that, in fact, the practical difference may make up for the fact -- I believe it was Justice Kavanaugh -- that really the difference between buildings and structures.","start":3380.84,"stop":3440.64,"duration":59.8},{"text":"And that might well be true. I also think that Taylor itself was looking at a definition of \"building.\" And Congress in 1984 was looking at a definition of \"building\" that had taken on its own very broad meaning in burglary law. If you look at the appendix to our brief in this case, most, if not all, of the states that actually defined \"building\" did so in terms of vehicles, other structures, et cetera. So they had a very broad definition that might not make sense in ordinary English but was what state burglary statutes used.","start":3440.64,"stop":3468.92,"duration":28.28},{"text":"And so, when this Court comes along in Taylor and says building or structure, it's really just explicating that. Another way to look at this is through the LaFave treatise that we obviously rely on in the briefs, which similarly makes clear that those -- that both \"building\" and \"structure\" were often broadly construed. Another point that I just wanted to clear up with respect to the government's position in Mathis.","start":3468.92,"stop":3489.36,"duration":20.44},{"text":"I don't think it is true that the government said that all of the statutes that it noted would, in fact, be out if Mathis came out the way it did.","start":3489.36,"stop":3496.24,"duration":6.88},{"text":"It said it would raise some questions. And many of those statutes, in fact, are broader than the statutes that we're talking about here today.
