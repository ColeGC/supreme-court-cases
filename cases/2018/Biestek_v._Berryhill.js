First, this Court's definition of the term \"substantial evidence\" and its application of that term in reviewing the decisions of administrative tribunals.","start":22.12,"stop":39.44,"duration":17.32},{"text":"Second, because the government's arguments as to why the expert's testimony standing alone is sufficient are unpersuasive.","start":39.44,"stop":46.32,"duration":6.88},{"text":"And, third, because this is the rule that has worked since 2002 in the Seventh Circuit and, indeed, is consistent with the government's own policy, as encapsulated in the Social Security Administration's Vocational Expert Handbook.","start":46.32,"stop":59,"duration":12.68}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"The counsel for the claimant asked for the source material but then didn't engage in any cross-examination of -- of the witness, of the expert witness.","start":59,"stop":75.44,"duration":16.44}]},{"speakerName":"Ishan Bhabha","textObjs":[{"text":"Your Honor, as a factual matter, after being denied the material, he did engage in some cross-examination that appears in the record.","start":75.44,"stop":83.8,"duration":8.36},{"text":"But I think critical, Your Honor, is that, without the material itself, any meaningful cross-examination regarding the expert's methodology, the provenance of the expert's labor market surveys was impossible. And I would note that it would be a rare case when you would be asked to cross-examine a statistical expert who is opining upon specific numbers that the expert has then modified through calculations without actually seeing the data sources itself. I think this Court's decision in Florida Power & Light is an important precedent in this respect because, there, the Court noted that the testimony, the well-founded testimony of an expert may be enough if firsthand information is unavailable. And, here, particularly because there were two sources the expert relied upon, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which was public, but then also her private labor market surveys, which the ALJ never saw and we never saw, that made any form of cross-examination or meaningful inquiry into the basis for these numbers impossible.","start":83.8,"stop":143.28,"duration":59.48}]},{"speakerName":"Samuel A.

The -- the argument that you're making sounds like a procedural question, a due process question, whether it was unfair not to require the expert to produce the underlying data. Can -- can you just explain how the procedural question that seems to be at the core of what you're arguing fits in with the substantial evidence test?","start":150.16,"stop":192.16,"duration":42}]},{"speakerName":"Ishan Bhabha","textObjs":[{"text":"Of course, Your Honor.

And the reason for this huge range in the answers experts give is it's not simply like an expert in these cases is Googling the number of appellate lawyers in Washington, D.C.

Expert says what this expert says, and you get up and say: How many of these people had the same conditions as my client has? And the expert says: Virtually every one of them. How many people did you do research on with respect to this issue? I contacted about 15 businesses. Have you placed these kinds of individuals in the kinds of jobs you've talked about? Yes, a hundred of them.

First, I think ours is the easier case because, here, the expert didn't say it was my experience.","start":782.64,"stop":791.24,"duration":8.6},{"text":"She said labor market surveys. And so the expert explicitly didn't say, I have placed a number of people. But taking Your Honor's hypothetical head on, in a situation in which a vocational expert says I've placed a number of people over my 10-year career in this position or in these sets of positions, I think it is likely that would not be substantial evidence, and here's why, Your Honor. Section 423(d)(2)(A), the statutory provision here, requires that there be a significant number of jobs in the national economy. Now that number has -- what \"significant\" means is a subject of some debates in the courts of appeals and it appears to be a multi-factor test.","start":791.24,"stop":827.84,"duration":36.6},{"text":"But what is critical is that's at least in the hundreds, and likely in the thousands. And these types of jobs that are getting placed are very specific jobs with people with very specific limitations.","start":827.84,"stop":838.12,"duration":10.28},{"text":"So even if an expert said I've placed 15 people over the last 10 years in these jobs with similar limitations to your client, that doesn't provide a basis to know that there are hundreds or thousands of those jobs.

What I'm trying to get at is I understand the need in some situations to actually see the surveys, but don't you have to lay at least some predicate ground for why that's necessary in your particular case?","start":866.24,"stop":896,"duration":29.76}]},{"speakerName":"Ishan Bhabha","textObjs":[{"text":"I understand your question, Your Honor. I think initially I will just say as a factual matter, and I think the record bears this out, as soon as my client's or claimant's representative asked for the surveys, the ALJ made clear she wasn't going to give them.","start":896,"stop":909.6,"duration":13.6},{"text":"So I don't think there was any opportunity even to proffer reasons.

Roberts, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, one way -- one way to be -- to look at the publicly available data, right, and there was no questioning about that, was there? I mean, to the extent the Bureau of Labor Statistics information shows, you say, 8,000 jobs in southwestern Michigan, if that's where it was, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a different number, why did you choose eight? In other words, there -- there were fields, I'm not saying there are ample fields, but there are fields for fertile cross-examination that weren't explored, I think.","start":942.64,"stop":970.32,"duration":27.68}]},{"speakerName":"Ishan Bhabha","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, I think it is certainly a different case if an expert only relies on public data.","start":970.32,"stop":974.96,"duration":4.64},{"text":"Then I absolutely agree you have exactly what the expert relied upon. In a case like this, however, and I think in many cases like this -- and this is why vocational expert testimony has been a subject of criticism -- the public data alone is not only not enough, but it is often of an entirely different character because the taxonomy in the public data, in the BLS data, uses a far larger definition of jobs than what the DOT, the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, codes, which is what the AL -- the VE is required to identify.

And the question presented by the government in Perales to the Court was whether or not the medical expert testimony in that context could be substantial evidence. And I think what's important about Perales is that, in part 5 of the opinion, while certainly also discussing procedural due process issues, the Court in Perales gives indicia of why the testimony there had probative value and why it was reliable.","start":1115.24,"stop":1146.48,"duration":31.24},{"text":"And I think it's very important to look at that case because, there, the medical experts didn't just give conclusions.
