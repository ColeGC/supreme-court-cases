Now, as to stare decisis, this really is a case where Hall is a \"survivor of obsolete constitutional thinking.\" The question was, you know, what has changed? What have we done? Recall that the number of cases this Court has decided in the sovereign immunity area, we're talking, you know, not just Seminole Tribe but Union Gas, Welch, Kiowa, all of those cases, and the reasoning of those cases is the South Carolina Ports Authority case, all long followed this Court's decision. And the basis for this Court's decision in Nevada versus Hall, both of which have been repudiated by this Court's later jurisprudence, are, number one, the Court said there's nothing explicit in the Constitution and we're not going to read a -- an immunity that is not explicit in the Constitution. This Court in at least a dozen cases has subsequently held over and over again that what matters for the protection of sovereign immunity was the framers' understanding at the time of the framing and the postulates that underlie the principles of the consequences of giving up the wild west law of nations for a more perfect union in which states won't retaliate against each other by saying, well, now we're going to -- you know, we're going to allow everybody to sue other states in our court and we're going to do this and we're going to do that. The -- the other thing that is different is, in Nevada versus Hall, this Court identified one interest supported by the principle of state sovereign immunity, and that was the state's fiscs, which, of course, was overwhelmingly important at the time of the framing. But, since then, this Court has said in at least a half a dozen cases that the dignity of states and their self-government autonomy are, as the -- as Justice Thomas explained for the Court in the Federal Maritime Commission case, the paramount interests to be protected by principles of sovereign immunity. Neither of those two principles that have since been elucidated by the Court were referenced or acknowledged in Nevada versus Hall.
