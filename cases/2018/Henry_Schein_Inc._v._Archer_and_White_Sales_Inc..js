And so, therefore, as to the non-signatory defendants, there is a question reserved by the court of appeals about the doctrine of equitable estoppel, and that would be an issue for the court of appeals to address on remand if this Court agrees with us on the question presented.","start":78.56,"stop":104.44,"duration":25.88},{"text":"That is obviously a discrete issue, not reached by the court of appeals in the decision below, and, again, an issue that would be open on remand. But, on the question presented, I think our submission is quite straightforward. The \"wholly groundless\" exception on which the court of appeals relied has no footing in the text of the Arbitration Act.","start":104.44,"stop":123.965,"duration":19.53},{"text":"Where the parties have agreed to delegate the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator, the merits of that issue are for the arbitrator and wholly for the arbitrator to decide. Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Arbitration Act all point in the same direction, where you have a valid delegation that is treated as this Court has indicated like an antecedent agreement to arbitrate, and all there is for a court to do is to determine, first, that that provision is itself valid and, second, to determine whether the opposing party is, in fact, resisting the enforcement of that provision.","start":123.965,"stop":163.2,"duration":39.23}]},{"speakerName":"Samuel A.

Shanmugam","textObjs":[{"text":"So, Mr. Chief Justice, I think there are two parts to your question. First, to pick up on my response to Justice Ginsburg, we are certainly not disputing that the issue of equitable estoppel, the issue of which parties are bound, is an issue that goes to validity.","start":196.255,"stop":211.75,"duration":15.5},{"text":"It's an issue for the court to decide. So, again, on remand, that would be a question for the court of appeals in the first instance.","start":211.75,"stop":219.26,"duration":7.51},{"text":"The court of appeals explicitly did not reach that question because of its holding on the \"wholly groundless\" exception.","start":219.26,"stop":224.69,"duration":5.43},{"text":"It said that the -- a requirement that arbitrability goes to the arbitrator was not enforceable as to anyone, even as to the signatories to the agreement.

But I think that, on the issue of arbitrability, this Court has said time and again, most recently in the First Options case, that arbitrability can be delegated where there is a sufficiently clear delegation, and once the issue is delegated, it is for the arbitrator.","start":245.03,"stop":275.85,"duration":30.82}]},{"speakerName":"Samuel A.

Shanmugam","textObjs":[{"text":"So all of the courts of appeals to have considered the issue have held that this type of incorporated delegation meets this Court's requirements, and let me explain why that's true, even though, again, that's an issue outside the scope of the question presented.","start":303.035,"stop":319.32,"duration":16.28},{"text":"We certainly think it would be appropriate for this Court to provide guidance on that issue, but the Court certainly does not have to reach it if it so chooses. What is going on in this case, if you look at the four corners of the delegation -- of the arbitration agreement -- and I would point the Court in particular to page 58 of the Joint Appendix or to page 8 of our brief -- is that the arbitration agreement by its terms incorporates the rules of the American Arbitration Association and it does so very clearly.","start":319.32,"stop":347.33,"duration":28.01},{"text":"That is a quite common arrangement, particularly in commercial arbitrations like the one at issue here. Then, if you take a look at the rules of the American Arbitration Association, those rules, and, in particular, Rule 7(a), clearly give the arbitrator the authority to decide arbitrability. And under this Court's decision in First Options, the relevant inquiry is whether or not the parties were willing to be bound by the arbitrator's determination on the issue in question. And so, with all due respect to Professor Bermann and his amicus brief, the position that he propounds has been rejected by every court of appeals to have considered this issue.","start":347.33,"stop":386.92,"duration":39.59},{"text":"And if the Court has any interest in this issue, I would refer the Court to the very thoughtful opinion of the Tenth Circuit in the Belnap case, which discusses this issue in some detail. Again, the Fifth Circuit, in the decision under review, ultimately did not decide that question.","start":386.92,"stop":403.1,"duration":16.18},{"text":"It did discuss that question, and I would respectfully submit that its discussion on that issue was somewhat confused. The Fifth Circuit seemed to think that because there was a substantive carve-out from the scope of arbitration here, that's the very carve-out that's in dispute for actions for injunctive relief, that that -- that somehow had a bearing on the validity of the delegation here. But I think with all due respect --","start":403.1,"stop":428.83,"duration":25.73}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"But the district court -- the district court made -- decided on alternative grounds, and wasn't the district court's first decision that this contract did not have a sufficiently clear and unmistakable delegation?","start":428.83,"stop":442.565,"duration":13.74}]},{"speakerName":"Kannon K.

But I would respectfully submit that I think that the law on this issue is quite clear and that, in particular, to the extent that the district court discussed this issue, Justice Ginsburg, its reliance and Respondent's reliance on the substantive carve -out cannot be correct. In other words, the Respondent's submission below, and really, I think, Respondent's only submission on this issue was that because there is a carve-out from the scope of arbitration, that somehow defeats the incorporation of the AAA rules which provide that arbitrability can be decided by the arbitrator. But that is the very issue that the parties agreed for the arbitrator to decide.
