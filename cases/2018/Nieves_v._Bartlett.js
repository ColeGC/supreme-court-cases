And the Court doesn't want a rule where an officer can be haled into court on any routine arrest and forced to defend the purity of his motives, however reasonable his actions. Nor should the Court want a rule that gives officers a reason to hesitate in situations where they should be able to act decisively. I want to start with the point about complexity because I believe this case has all the elements the Court identified in Lozman.

So I think that, at a minimum, the Court's rule should -- the probable cause element should apply for the stated crime of arrest or the crimes charged or crimes closely related to those crimes.

Healthy, plaintiff, he engaged in protected expression. That won't be too hard to show. The defendant harbored retaliatory animus.","start":718.16,"stop":730.56,"duration":12.4},{"text":"In a lot of these cases, he did, for political or racial maybe or other reasons. Three, animus was a substantial factor motivating the decision.","start":730.56,"stop":742.72,"duration":12.16},{"text":"That's a little tougher to show where there's probable cause.

Suppose we added to that and we took what Justice Rehnquist said in Crawford-El, that if you get to the stage where you get through one, two, and maybe three, and there is probable cause for something, the plaintiff has to show with some objective evidence that the arrest was a pretext for retaliation.","start":755.6,"stop":786.4,"duration":30.8},{"text":"That's one way of doing it.","start":786.4,"stop":787.16,"duration":0.76},{"text":"That's Justice Rehnquist's way. A second way is that you have to know that -- you at least have to know the arresting policeman, but there is a statute that forbids what he did, you can't find it out later, or no reasonable person would have arrested or no reasonable policeman without the animus would have arrested this person for this thing in the moment.","start":787.16,"stop":820.88,"duration":33.72},{"text":"That's after you prove that he had a bad motive, the policeman.

Let's say now no reasonable police officer in Washington, D.C., no reasonable police officer in a specific neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

I think the Court could do something similar.","start":895.96,"stop":926.88,"duration":30.92},{"text":"I think the problem with that is what the Court recognized in Hartman, is that the exception becomes, again, difficult to administer.","start":926.88,"stop":933.64,"duration":6.76},{"text":"What's a direct admission? And how does the court -- how does a court draw that line? And that's going to be litigated in a variety of cases.
