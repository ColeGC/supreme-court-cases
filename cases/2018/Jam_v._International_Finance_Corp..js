Fisher","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The IOIA gives international organizations \"the same immunity from suit as is enjoyed by foreign governments.\" The plain text of this provision, coupled with the structure of the IOIA and the drafting history, make clear that the same immunity provision gives international organizations the same immunity that foreign governments are entitled to today under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act. Starting with the text, my opponents do not dispute that, as a general rule, when a statutory provision refers to another body of law, especially, as here, in the present tense, that body of law is incorporated as of the moment of suit in any given case. And, indeed, they don't dispute --","start":8.48,"stop":55.76,"duration":47.28}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen G.

In the case we wrote last term that Justice Gorsuch wrote, the word was \"monetary relief.\" Does that mean as of the past, or does it mean what we call money relief now? I mean, there are many cases like that. And here the word is \"is.\" Does the word \"is\" refer to the past, is at the moment a passage, or later? The two arguments that I'd like you to address that are opposite you are, one, states do many things, nations, many, many things, and so, if we take immunity from them for commercial things, we leave lots of immunity with them for those other things. But international organizations, some of them, do only one thing: lend money or the equivalent.","start":69.76,"stop":127.08,"duration":57.32},{"text":"And if we take immunity from them, that's the end of the immunity or close. That's one argument. The second is this: If we decide against you, and we've made a mistake, or along comes a case where they really should have immunity, the President and the State Department can give it to them.

But, in Carcieri, which is the \"now\" case, the Indian case, the Court went out of its way in that opinion to say the insertion of the word \"now\" takes us out of the ordinary situation, which is when the referenced law applies at the time of suit.","start":187.36,"stop":204.32,"duration":16.96},{"text":"And so you can look at the Sutherland treatise, which dates back to 1904, on this principle. And look at its -- in -- in your own case, Justice Breyer, I think if I was going to give you one case, it would be the Steamboat versus Chase case we cite in our reply brief. That's interpreting the Judiciary Act, which goes all the way back to the founding, of course, and says where the common law is competent to give a remedy, such and such a remedy is permissible. And in Steamboat, the Court rejected the exact argument the other side makes here, which is, first of all, that the law had to be incorporated at the time of suit and, second of all, that there was something different about the common law as to a statute at the time of the enactment.","start":204.32,"stop":241.32,"duration":37},{"text":"So all of the textual stuff is in our favor. Now you've also asked me two other questions and let me address them.","start":241.32,"stop":246.72,"duration":5.4},{"text":"So starting with the commercial activity exception as applied to a group like the IFC, when you answer -- when you think of that question, it's a question of how close you -- you put the lens into what's going on here. So if you just take a foreign state as the -- as the comparator here, a foreign state itself does all kinds of things.","start":246.72,"stop":264.76,"duration":18.04},{"text":"Like you said, Justice Breyer, they are not commercial activity.","start":264.76,"stop":267.32,"duration":2.56},{"text":"But a foreign state might have a bank, for example, that does almost all commercial activity. And so the same thing is true with international organizations, and let me answer that in a few different steps.","start":267.32,"stop":277,"duration":9.68},{"text":"So, first of all, look at the sweep of international organizations.","start":277,"stop":280.36,"duration":3.36},{"text":"Many do things like regulation, for example, managing fisheries.","start":280.36,"stop":284.32,"duration":3.96},{"text":"They do things like dispute resolution, law enforcement, Interpol.","start":284.32,"stop":288.76,"duration":4.44},{"text":"They do scientific research and agricultural research.","start":288.76,"stop":292.48,"duration":3.72},{"text":"All of those things are non-commercial activities on the other side. Then you have the category, the special category, of lending banks, but even within lending banks, not all the things that lending banks do are commercial activity.","start":292.48,"stop":304.24,"duration":11.76},{"text":"The IFC itself on its website talks about how it gives advice to foreign governments about legislation that ought to be passed regulating financial transactions with the private sector. That is not probably commercial activity. And then, even within lending activities, Justice Breyer, just take the World Bank, it has five separate institutions.","start":304.24,"stop":323.48,"duration":19.24},{"text":"Now the IFC is on one side.","start":323.48,"stop":325.36,"duration":1.88},{"text":"What the IFC does is -- is loan money at market rates for profit for private sector projects.","start":325.36,"stop":331.8,"duration":6.44},{"text":"There are other components of the World Bank and there are other lending institutions that are international organizations that give grants for public works programs or that do the kind of spending that governments do.","start":331.8,"stop":342.68,"duration":10.88},{"text":"And the government's argued in past cases, and we think they're probably right, that that is not commercial activity either. So, when the other side says, well, everything is commercial activity, it's no different than the foreign state coming to this and saying, well, if the Bank of Switzerland does commercial activity, then we're -- we're stuck.","start":342.68,"stop":357.28,"duration":14.6},{"text":"Well, no, no, no, it's just how closely you look at the problem.","start":357.28,"stop":360.04,"duration":2.76}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen G. Breyer","textObjs":[{"text":"What about -- the third was if we -- if we decide with you -- if we decide against you, see, that would mean there is sovereign immunity.","start":360.04,"stop":369.36,"duration":9.32},{"text":"But there shouldn't be in a particular case, the State Department can waive it and they have to be -- response.

Breyer","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, you can look -- the reason I ask policy questions is because the hornbook said, yes, apply it as of now as long as it's consistent with the purpose of the statute.","start":405.76,"stop":420,"duration":14.24},{"text":"And the purpose of the statute, going back to 1945 and the U.N. and everything, was to get these organizations to locate here. So it's not just policy for policy. It's policy for purpose.","start":420,"stop":431.96,"duration":11.96},{"text":"And purpose is tied into how you interpret the language.","start":431.96,"stop":435.6,"duration":3.64}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey L. Fisher","textObjs":[{"text":"So let me give you the practical answer and then the purpose answer. On the practical answer, organizations, especially if they want a headquarter here or are headquartered here, are fully able to -- to lobby Congress or the executive branch for special immunity.","start":435.6,"stop":450.08,"duration":14.48},{"text":"And there are many examples across international organizations. Take the Organization of American States, OAS.","start":450.08,"stop":455.84,"duration":5.76},{"text":"And the Solicitor General discusses this in -- the organization in its brief.","start":455.84,"stop":458.6,"duration":2.76},{"text":"In 1994, it negotiated a special immunity provision for itself to get more than the ordinary restrictive form of immunity that was available under the IOIA. So there are -- there are pathways available, and they have been used even more so. Remember, the United States, as you say, has a -- has a sometimes principal interest in these organizations.","start":458.6,"stop":477.84,"duration":19.24},{"text":"So it is quite responsive to them when they come and say: We need more than the IOIA gives us. But, Justice Breyer, let me turn back to the -- the original purpose, which was the legislative history is quite clear on what the purpose was.","start":477.84,"stop":490.76,"duration":12.92},{"text":"As you say, this was partly to create a form of immunity to give some comfort to these organizations.","start":490.76,"stop":496.96,"duration":6.2},{"text":"But the question is, what form of immunity did they ask for and what did they get? What they did is they came to Congress and said treat us like foreign governments. Give us immunity, as Congress put it in a Senate report, of a governmental nature.","start":496.96,"stop":509.52,"duration":12.56},{"text":"And so what did Congress do? It gave them exactly what they asked for.","start":509.52,"stop":512.32,"duration":2.8},{"text":"It said we're going to treat you as a default measure like a foreign government. And, remember, the words of the statute are \"same immunity.\" \"Same immunity\" as is enjoyed by federal governments.","start":512.32,"stop":522.48,"duration":10.16},{"text":"So we're going to give you the same immunity, subject to the President's ability to just -- adjust it and subject to your own ability and your own treaty to negotiate for more, and subject, thirdly, to Congress's ability to give you some immunity that you don't have even by way of your own treaty.","start":522.48,"stop":539.2,"duration":16.72}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"Can we go to that issue raised in part? The special immunity, I know, was even negotiated by the U.N., I think, in the 1990s, and OAS and others, but assume that we're in your regiment, and Justice Breyer made the assumption that if a lawsuit came to us now under your theory, and it was limited immunity, that the President or Congress could give immunity to the other side.

Fisher","textObjs":[{"text":"Certainly, we could -- we would say we can go forward on this suit because -- because there is no such law. If that law were passed, you'd have two questions.","start":587.08,"stop":597,"duration":9.92},{"text":"One is, did Congress make it retroactive? And you look to Altmann to think about how to judge the retroactivity of immunity provisions.","start":597,"stop":604.52,"duration":7.52},{"text":"And then, if it were retroactive, whether that were permissible. But, you know, we're a long way from -- from that sort of a situation.","start":604.52,"stop":611.48,"duration":6.96},{"text":"I think the important thing going forward -- and this is, I think, what the concern is on the other side, is not so much about this case but about incentives and policies going forward -- they have every opportunity to negotiate in one form or another or to procure a heightened form of immunity. And, Justice Sotomayor, let me say one more thing to you and Justice Breyer about, you know, the idea of the executive branch getting involved.","start":611.48,"stop":632.36,"duration":20.88},{"text":"This is one of the problems, I submit, with the other side's argument. Remember, part of the goal of the FSIA in the first section of the Act in Section 1602 is to get -- is to get the executive branch out of the immunity business. Congress made the determination that it was a bad idea to have every case turning on individualized suggestions of immunity and executive branch political policy.","start":632.36,"stop":656.16,"duration":23.8},{"text":"And so the other side, by importing the common law of 1945, would reintroduce that problem into international organization immunity in a way that we don't think would be very good politically or very workable in the courts. And I'd hasten to add that even under the rule of 1945, if the question were what does the executive branch think about any given lawsuit or any given immunity for any given type of suit, that would just lead you right back to the FSIA, and it would lead you back to the same conclusion that we submit to you here. So either pathway, whether, Justice Breyer, you start with the way you've always looked at cases, with the word \"is\" and the word \"same\" and the reference canon that I've described and say all of those things lead you to a time of suit rule, or if you start with the law of 1945 and say, what was the law in 1945? Well, Hoffman and -- in Ex Parte Peru were clear that the law of 1945 was the executive branch decides, and it's not for the Court -- this is -- I'm going to give you the Court's own language -- it's not for the Court to give immunity where the executive branch has not seen fit to give it. And if that were the test, you'd come right back to where you -- where I started here, which is that the FSIA would control or, at the bare minimum, the executive branch position in this lawsuit on the type of immunity that ought to apply in this situation would control.","start":656.16,"stop":738.6,"duration":82.44},{"text":"So --","start":738.6,"stop":738.64,"duration":0.04}]},{"speakerName":"Neil Gorsuch","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Fisher, if I can pick up on Justice Breyer's question.","start":738.64,"stop":741.2,"duration":2.56},{"text":"The reference canon, I take all -- all of your points, but sometimes, let's say we have a statute that -- that refers to another statute. Usually, we would look at the second statute that's being incorporated as of the time of -- of the adoption of the first statute.","start":741.2,"stop":760.2,"duration":19},{"text":"Right?

Fisher","textObjs":[{"text":"So for two reasons, Justice Gorsuch, and one of them, if you'll forgive me, is going to be something you said in the Alan Contoe opinion.","start":781.04,"stop":786.64,"duration":5.6}]},{"speakerName":"Neil Gorsuch","textObjs":[{"text":"I was afraid of that.

Fisher","textObjs":[{"text":"But for two reasons.","start":789.56,"stop":790.28,"duration":0.72},{"text":"One is Congress has a choice to make when it writes legislation.","start":790.28,"stop":793.72,"duration":3.44},{"text":"It can lock in a given rule by setting a specific statutory provision and says that's the rule we want, just like if Congress uses a particular word, at the time of the enactment, the meaning of that word at the time of enactment would be what Congress -- we'd assume Congress wanted. Or Congress could do something different, which is to say, look, we're not sure exactly of the metes and bounds of the -- of the law.","start":793.72,"stop":814.28,"duration":20.56},{"text":"We're just going to tie it to this other area of law as a general matter.","start":814.28,"stop":817.32,"duration":3.04},{"text":"And that's what Congress did here.","start":817.32,"stop":818.48,"duration":1.16},{"text":"It did the latter. So it took an area of law as a point of reference and said: Just use that as the default rule and then adjust as necessary.","start":818.48,"stop":826.68,"duration":8.2},{"text":"And those are just two different pathways Congress can go down. And they date, as I said, all the way back to the First Judiciary Act there, in the Sutherland treatise, all the way back to 1904, and so there's just two different pathways Congress can go down. And it makes perfect sense, I think, in a situation like this, especially where you have a common law doctrine being referenced, at least a common law at the time, and one that was, indeed, not just any old common law doctrine but one that was in a great deal of flux at the time.","start":826.68,"stop":851.64,"duration":24.96},{"text":"So it made every reason -- it made every good reason for Congress to have a general reference, not a specific one. And then the second reason, Justice Gorsuch, is the one you mentioned sitting on the Tenth Circuit, which is that, as time goes by, it becomes all the more stilted or antiquated or even foolish sometimes to try to answer questions in the modern day according to what some bygone era doctrine would have required, and especially a bygone era doctrine like this. If I understand the other side's position correctly, basically, the question they're having -- they would want every federal court to ask in these cases is, what would the Truman Administration's State Department have wanted to do in this case? And when you have things like this, which didn't even -- an organization that didn't even exist at the time, sometimes doing activities that weren't even contemplated at the time, things like sovereign wealth funds, which foreign sovereigns now engage in, for example, who knows what the State Department would have thought then. I think there's every reason then to fall back on the reference canon.","start":851.64,"stop":915.04,"duration":63.4},{"text":"And if I can say one more thing before reserving my time, if you have any doubt about just the plain text argument I've given you, I would urge you to compare the text in Section 288a to the text -- Section 288d, which has the exact dichotomy that -- that I've been discussing today. One subsection, subsection (a), says that the same immunity rules apply, and subsection (b) says that foreign officials -- I'm sorry, international organization officials are entitled to absolute immunity. So this is yet another reason why if the other side were correct and if Congress had wanted to lay down the rule they did, why would they not have just used the absolute immunity language in subsection (b) of subsection (d) and that, indeed, was the original draft of this act that was discarded. So I could go on, but I'd rather save the rest of my time for rebuttal.","start":915.04,"stop":974.92,"duration":59.88}]},{"speakerName":"John G.

So, instead of suing the person who actually injured them, the power plant in India, they come here and sue us. And I really think what you're going to see here is that this is just going to become another version of the sorts of foreign-cubed lawsuits that the Court has been concerned about under the Alien Tort Statute where the international organization is just going to be subbed in for the foreign defendant and it's going to be subbed in in a situation where we're going to have a very significant pile of money. And if I could just close with this thought -- I'm just going to pick up on Justice Breyer's thought -- the law in the District of Columbia, where virtually all these organizations have been housed, are headquartered, has been virtually absent immunity under D.C.

But the more important point is, even if it weren't in flux, it wouldn't matter one wit, because the other side is making a sweeping proposition, which is any general reference to common law is fixed in time.

One is, to the extent any claims are on contracts, they can write their own contracts and negotiate their own contracts.
