And I think that, you know, I haven't talked about the treaty canon so far because I think neutral principles are more than sufficient to resolve this case for Respondent, but at least under the -- the generous interpretation principles for Indians, I don't think that's what the Indians thought they were getting, that this exploitation of the travel on the very land they gave up, securing for themselves the right to travel across it. I think that it's very natural and consistent with what I think the expectation of the Yakamas would have been, that they could continue traveling across that land with their goods as they were already doing it at the time, and -- and that means -- that means transporting without paying a fee or owing an obligation to the states.","start":3251.6,"stop":3306.76,"duration":55.16}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"Does it mean anything that this tax is literally on traveling the route, importing by a highway?
