So, you know, that's -- I think, you know, we offer those -- those three suggestions and -- and, you know, we -- we think historically, the most historically sound thing to do is to overrule Austin. So I think, you know, we've got also grounds for saying that Austin is -- I think fits within the Court's precedents on when to overrule cases notwithstanding stare decisis.

Now Justice Scalia, I -- I do want to call your attention to in -- in Austin, in his concurrence, was grappling with this -- this idea, as can we do something that's grossly disproportionate on in rem the way we would do it in personam.

So even if we imagine that -- that the Court would take such a radical approach, it -- it would break with, for example, the commercial speech doctrine, which there was a long history of commercial speech activity in this country before the 1970s decision in which this Court held that there is a commercial speech right, and did so in a case against the state without even pausing on the incorporation question. So, you know, even if some forfeitures are non-punitive, other forfeitures are punitive.","start":3302.44,"stop":3363.6,"duration":61.16},{"text":"And the forfeiture in this case clearly meets Austin's test that it be at least partly punitive.
