Now it's not a question of when they would have to pay once they've admitted that there's a taking, but when they do something that constitutes a taking, and they say, no, this isn't a taking at all, and, therefore, you're getting zero, which I understand to be your claim here, then you can go directly to federal court and bring an action under 1983.
