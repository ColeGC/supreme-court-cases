For three reasons Lorenzo's actions do not support liability.

And I do think it's a quite extraordinary argument to say that the Commission could, by adopting a rule in 1942, change the meaning of a statute that was enacted by the Congress and signed by the President in 1933. In fact, you know, this Court has repeatedly rejected that kind of field preemption or exclusive remedy argument in the securities laws, most prominently in the Affiliated Ute case, where the Court says quite literally even though petitioner is not -- or the securities seller in that case is not liable under (b), he is liable under (a) and (c) because those provisions are not so restricted.

I -- I suppose a final point, as we're sort of searching for meaning for (b), I do think the Court has, you know, reiterated on many occasions that even a provision that seems redundant or that doesn't add anything to the substantive scope of the law can still serve a valuable purpose by clarifying or by -- by marking out what the heartland of the -- of the violation is. And here, if you look at the history of the securities laws, Rule 10b-5 came about nine years after the Securities Act, which had changed the common-law rule and brought disclosure and statements to the fore as a -- as a responsibility for those issuing and trading in securities. So it makes sense that Rule 10b-5(b) would -- would mark out statements as a particular area of concern and would say, if you can show that somebody made a statement, then you've shown liability under 10b-5. But I don't think that that in any way forecloses liability under (a) and (c).","start":2796.6,"stop":2853.36,"duration":56.76},{"text":"And as I said earlier, the Affiliated Ute case, I think, is -- is squarely on point and says somebody can be liable under (a) and (c) even if they're not liable under (b).

And Justice Alito's opinion explained that a tax crime that was not evasion but still involved deceit would be covered by that statute because the enumeration of tax evasion didn't preempt the field or didn't serve as the exclusive vehicle for all tax-related claims. And I think the same analysis applies here. The statement -- the enumeration of statements in Rule 10b-5(b) does not preempt or foreclose acts of conduct that fall within the text of the statute.
