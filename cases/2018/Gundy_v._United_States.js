SORNA's efficacy, if Petitioner prevails, will not just be sharply curtailed. It will arguably be thoroughly gutted as -- as a matter of how this federal law works. And if it is possible, and we think it is not just possible but the most natural interpretation of the Attorney General's authority to say this is a narrow authority, to specify the applicability of requirements in an on/off way in order to get people into the system, and that interpretation avoids constitutional problems, right, it's constitutional, if we read it to say do it to the extent you can, then, as Petitioner concedes, I think if that's -- if it's possible to read the statute that way, that's constitutional and that's what we would urge the Court to do.

This was a law whose retroactive application was opposed by the states, which is part of the reason why only 18 states have implemented it. States spoke out against the retroactive application of the law before the Attorney General made his determination. And so states themselves, who are the experts in this area having run registration systems for years, don't want this Act to be fully retroactive. My friend emphasized that this delegation was all about practicality, but the reality is, is that the Attorney General's promulgated rule does not account for practicality in any way, which is further evidence for this Court that to the extent feasible was not the standard of this delegation.
