But even if a conviction referred to the judgment of conviction that happens in connection with the sentencing, a defendant is still imprisoned in connection with a conviction once he pleads guilty or is found guilty by a jury and is later detained, because that detention is at least in part to assure his appearance at sentencing and to ensure that he is there to receive the entry of the judgment of conviction that is largely certain at that point. And it also -- at that point, his -- his imprisonment becomes punitive because he no longer is subject to the presumption of innocence. So for all of those reasons, even, you know, what -- whatever meaning this Court gives to conviction, certainly, the period after his guilty plea would be tolled, we -- we believe that the entire period of his imprisonment would -- should be tolled because all of the time that he served on his state sentence, and is still serving on his state sentence, is in connection with those -- the state convictions that landed him in jail in the first place.
