Now, predictably, that wreaks havoc with the statutory scheme, most notably, by stripping public employees of crucial protections like respondeat superior, and also by treating public employers worse than private ones in a statute whose purpose was to bring parity to the two. Now, as our brief explains, the best way to read the statute is from beginning to end, but let me just start right in the middle, as my colleagues do, with the -- with the phrase that is causing all this mischief, \"also means.\" Respondents do not dispute that that term can have two alternative meanings.","start":29.6,"stop":77.88,"duration":48.28},{"text":"It could mean in addition, there's an additional universe beyond that which is defined in the first sentence.","start":77.88,"stop":85.8,"duration":7.92},{"text":"Or it could mean further elaboration of the preceding definition, along the lines of \"moreover\" or \"incorporates.\" So how do we know which one is intended?

And I have to emphasize that you know that the \"agent\" clause is problematic because of the extremes to which Respondents go to redefine \"agent.\" They define \"agent\" to mean third-party independent subcontractor, because they cannot accept the possibility that, as is clear under the common law for hundreds of years, agents, the classic agent, are employees.

So the first question would be whether \"any agent\" means any agent whatsoever or just non-employee agents that aren't already covered. If you answered that question against, you know, what I guess would be my position as I stand here, you'd -- you'd still have a second question, which is if individual supervisors, for example, were on the hook, the question would still be, how are they on the hook?

First, that is by far the most natural reading of the text, given its ordinary meaning and consistent usage across federal law. Second, Congress rejected the ready template in Title VII adopted just two years earlier that did exclude small state and local government employers by putting the definition or by putting government employers in the definition of \"person.\" Congress didn't do that and followed the FLSA template that it adopted at the same time in 1974. And, third, Petitioner's contrary reading would leave a sizable loophole that would allow any employer to evade the Age Act by outsourcing discrimination to small agents. And in order to avoid that problem, Petitioner is forced ultimately to abandon the core theory they offer of the text that treats the two clauses the same way. Now, in terms of the ordinary meaning, we agree with Respondent that the language \"also means\" and its usage throughout federal statutes is clear, and it's clear that Congress used it in that ordinary way because it didn't follow the Title VII approach. Now my friend on the other side suggests that the differences in the definitions of \"person\" in Title VII versus the Age Act precluded Congress from doing the same thing.

The one thing we know the \"agent\" clause is supposed to do from Manhart and other cases in the Title VII context is to prevent what Manhart called delegating discrimination to corporate shells.","start":2634.48,"stop":2669.12,"duration":34.64},{"text":"But if you take Petitioner's reading seriously, it means that the second clause merely clarifies the first, so the 20-employee threshold reaches all the way to the government clause in the second sentence.

And just to -- to highlight those a little bit more, in the meaning of \"agent,\" not only did Congress have no reason to use \"agent\" in its broadest sense, because employees would already trigger respondeat superior liability. In this statute, Congress didn't use language that it has used in other statutes like the FLSA that lower courts and the Department of Labor have read to include individual liability. So if I can point you to one example. The FLSA, Section 203(d) at page 1-A of the appendix to our brief says that an employer includes any person who acts directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer with respect to an employee. The FMLA, the Family Medical Leave Act, uses the same language.","start":2757.48,"stop":2803.92,"duration":46.44},{"text":"Lower courts and the Department of Labor have construed those statutes to impose individual liability in some circumstances.

And, in addition, even if you concluded that some subset of employees or supervisors were agents in some circumstances, I think you still would have to answer the question that the lower courts have consistently answered against individual liability by determining is this individual employee personally liable or is instead he liable only in his official or representative capacity. And the idea behind that is simple. If you are an employee and are counted as the employer only because you're acting as an agent, that is, only because you are exercising the authority of the employer in varying the terms and conditions of a particular employee's employment, liability naturally runs against the employer whose authority you are exercising. And to resolve that question, you would need to consider a number of principles that govern remedies law, and you'd need to take cognizance of potential spillover effects for other federal statutes, which we think is yet another reason not to delve into those issues here, because the only question you need to answer is does the \"agent\" clause add some category of additional agents.
