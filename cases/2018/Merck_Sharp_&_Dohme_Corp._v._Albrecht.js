That cannot be right.","start":7.56,"stop":28,"duration":20.44},{"text":"If a manufacturer, as Merck did here, informs the FDA of a possible risk and unsuccessfully asks to revise its label in light of that risk, then failure to warn claims based on that risk are preempted as a matter of law. That rule follows from the statutory and regulatory framework governing the FDA's conduct and from the presumption of regularity. The presumption of regularity, of course, assumes that federal agencies do their jobs correctly.

I think that that's pretty clear.","start":64.28,"stop":95.36,"duration":31.08},{"text":"The question is sort of, you know, did -- did you propose a different kind of warning? So let me give you a hypothetical. Suppose that you manufacture a drug and there's some evidence, whether it's enough, hard to know, but there's some evidence that it causes ovarian cancer, and you, the drug manufacturer, proposes a warning to the FDA, but instead of saying that the drug causes ovarian cancer, you say it causes ovarian cysts. Now ovarian cysts are nothing that anybody wants to have, but they're an inconvenience.","start":95.36,"stop":132.4,"duration":37.04},{"text":"They're not ovarian cancer.

And then the whole question boils down to what was your proposal, what was their response, were you both talking about the same things? In other words, were you both talking about major risks? Or did the FDA look at your proposal and say they're not talking about major fractures; they're only talking about stress fractures; and there's no reason to think that stress fractures are a real risk and no reason to put that in the label.","start":186.96,"stop":228,"duration":41.04}]},{"speakerName":"Shay Dvoretzky","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't think that's quite right, Justice Kagan, because you have to look not only at the warning that was proposed but also at the information that was in front of the FDA about the risk.

We're not trying to absolve the manufacturer of its responsibilities. But, when you have before you an impossibility preemption case where the FDA rejected a proposed warning, the only way to understand the meaning of that rejection and what it means for impossibility is in light of the FDA's part of its obligations.

But the fractures that are not caused by trauma can be small fractures, stress fractures that take care of themselves with rest and elevation, and large fractures, where all of a sudden you're staring at a bone that's popping out the wrong way.

Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by addressing an issue that both Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch have touched on, and I think it's important to distinguish between two potential types of confusion. The first is that, in October of 2010, when the FDA ultimately decided that an addition to the warnings and precautions section of these labels was warranted, it rejected Merck's proposal that the warning include repeated uses of the term \"stress fracture\". And FDA did express at that time the concern that practitioners, for whom that term usually connoted a relatively minor event, might read it as understating the seriousness of the potential health risk of Fosamax. That potential type of confusion needs to be distinguished from the question, was FDA confused by Merck's submission as a whole? And there's no reason to think that that was so. At page 670 of the Joint Appendix, Merck kind of, in the introductory section of its proposal, summarizes what it's -- the warning that it's proposing to add, and it says at the very top of the page: Merck is proposing to add language to both the precaution and adverse reaction post-marketing experience section of the label to describe low-energy fractures that have been reported, of which some have been stress insufficiency at the subtrochanteric region of the femoral shaft.","start":1055,"stop":1145.28,"duration":90.28},{"text":"So --","start":1145.28,"stop":1145.56,"duration":0.28}]},{"speakerName":"John G.

The second thing I'd like to point out in that regard is what my colleague was referring to as the -- Merck's own explanation for its use of the term \"stress fracture\".
