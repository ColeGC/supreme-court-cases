Second, the estoppel that was enacted by Congress specifically references the jurisdiction of the district court and the International Trade Commission, not the Court of Federal Claims, where the government's patent litigation takes place, reinforcing the definition of \"person\" not to include the government.","start":27.8,"stop":53.52,"duration":25.72},{"text":"That was a linchpin to the structure that Congress set up.","start":53.52,"stop":57.08,"duration":3.56},{"text":"It created a new adversarial administrative process, and part of that balance was to ensure that patent holders that were subject to that new adversarial process could then be protected from having to go back and relitigate in court, in district court or the International Trade Commission.","start":57.08,"stop":74.16,"duration":17.08}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Your position is that it's -- the estoppel provision is the linchpin, you just said, but your position would be the same even if there were no estoppel provision.","start":74.16,"stop":85.8,"duration":11.64},{"text":"Is that not so?","start":85.8,"stop":86.64,"duration":0.84}]},{"speakerName":"Beth S.

It's a reinforcement.","start":87.84,"stop":91.44,"duration":3.6},{"text":"The Dictionary Act definition and the presumptive definition would do the work here because that is the reliance by Congress and the give-and-take before the branches so Congress knows how the word \"person\" is going to be interpreted when they use it. So the linchpin part of the estoppel, though, reinforces that because it only refers specifically to the court -- the district court and International Trade Commission. And the third point I wanted to make, Your Honor, was that this does not exclude the government from going after bad patents. To the contrary, the government is different, has the most powerful tools to do that.","start":91.44,"stop":126,"duration":34.56},{"text":"First, the Patent and Trademark Office director has the power to sua sponte initiate ex parte reexaminations and can go after patents after they've been issued.","start":126,"stop":138.08,"duration":12.08}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"What if -- would the government or the Postal Service be able to initiate ex parte reexamination?

Alito, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, that -- I mean, that's an argument that makes me doubt your -- your argument on the statutory language because I think if -- if this were prevented -- presented to Congress, and the issue before Congress was do we want a federal agency to be able to initiate one of these AIA proceedings in the open, in accordance with the law, or do we want to allow them to pick up the phone to the PTO and say -- Patent and Trademark Office and say, hey, why don't you sua sponte look into this?

Instead, the question is, is there anything affirmative to indicate that the government was included? And I think when you look at the -- the two aspects that the government invokes, oh, you know, the government gets to own patents; oh, and we get to raise this defense about intervening rights, both of those have very strong contextual affirmative statements. 207 makes clear that each federal agency can own a patent, obtain a patent.","start":489.24,"stop":522.96,"duration":33.72},{"text":"And we know from 1498 and its predecessor statute that the government can raise all defenses.","start":522.96,"stop":528.52,"duration":5.56},{"text":"So there is nothing to suggest from that context that there was an affirmative indication to extend this to the government.","start":528.52,"stop":535.6,"duration":7.08}]},{"speakerName":"Neil Gorsuch","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, counsel, the argument on the other side I know we're going to hear is Section 207 allows the government to participate in a lot of aspects of the patent system affirmatively, and given that, it would be natural to extend it to IPR review as well.

Agencies, et cetera. Moreover, there are quite a few or several provisions in the patent law where the word \"person\" seems to include the government.

Brinkmann","textObjs":[{"text":"Your Honor, I can give you three examples that we discuss in our reply brief.","start":672.2,"stop":675.84,"duration":3.64},{"text":"The first one would be Section 317. It's contemporaneous with the review provisions we're talking about here. That has to do with obtaining information from the agency about settlement, and it provides that the government can do it just by a request, but then it explains that persons must make more of a showing to get it. That is a distinction.","start":675.84,"stop":696.32,"duration":20.48},{"text":"So that's a clear example. This -- and that's not just 317.","start":696.32,"stop":700.12,"duration":3.8},{"text":"It's also in 327 and 135 having to do with the different review provisions.

The third one I would point to is 257. That has to do with when the director is referring a person to the attorney general for fraud.","start":723.4,"stop":735.52,"duration":12.12},{"text":"And that clearly refers not to the government. So, if there's one thing we know is that the word \"person,\" the term \"person,\" is not used the same throughout the Act, and that's because Congress has a backdrop and knows that it does not include the government unless it makes an affirmative showing to the contrary. And I should say, in addition to the two we talked about where there was an affirmative showing, 207, federal agencies can own patents, so things flow from that, and you can -- the government can raise defenses through 1498. There's another provision that's very informative.","start":735.52,"stop":767.52,"duration":32},{"text":"It's the provision that was at issue in the Florida Prepaid case that was held unconstitutional, trying to waive the sovereign immunity for states.","start":767.52,"stop":774.64,"duration":7.12},{"text":"The other part of that provision, though, in 296 was, who could sue?

In other words, the government is looking at an area, it says somebody is claiming a patent on this, that's preventing us from inventing, that's preventing us from getting a patent, so we have to kind of clear the field in order to innovate.

Now private parties have available to them an alternative, IPR/CBM proceedings, to try to escape that burden, to try to come before a different decisionmaker who will apply a de novo standard of review. You could think of it as roughly analogous to a primary jurisdiction mechanism, where one issue in the lawsuit is referred to an agency that has expertise in -- in the relevant area. And the Court, in applying various presumptions and clear statements rules -- clear statement rules, has been especially solicitous of the government as defendant; that is, resolving in the government's favor ambiguities about whether the government can be sued, what is the scope of its liability, et cetera. This is not quite that.","start":3088.56,"stop":3154.4,"duration":65.84},{"text":"But Petitioner is still arguing that the government should be denied access to a procedural mechanism in its capacity as defendant that is available to all private parties. If somebody argued that the patent laws allowed any other defendant to show patent invalidity by a preponderance of the evidence but allowed -- but required a federal agency as defendant to prove it by clear and convincing evidence, I think the Court's reaction would be it's conceivable, but we would need pretty clear language that Congress intended that result. This is not quite that, but the Petitioner's argument is still we don't get access to a mechanism for a more favorable burden of proof. The second thing I would say is we've been looking at the case up to this point from the perspective of the Postal Service, and, in part, Congress created the IPR and CBM mechanisms with the interests of private parties in mind, the interests in mind of people who might be sued for infringement and would want an avenue for seeking invalidation of the patent.","start":3154.4,"stop":3216.28,"duration":61.88},{"text":"But Congress also wanted to assist the PTO in doing its job.
