deadlines.","start":450.053,"stop":455.02,"duration":4.97},{"text":"First, that within 180 days of the discrimination, the aggrieved employee must give notice that he intends to file suit, and second,

presented.","start":489.179,"stop":508.297,"duration":19.12},{"text":"The 15(b) exhaustion of remedies questioned is easy to resolve simply by reference to the statutory language.","start":508.297,"stop":519.933,"duration":11.64},{"text":"At the threshold, it should be noted that the petitioner did in fact allow the administrative process in this case to reach a final outcome of rejection of his complaint as being filed too late in the administrative arena.","start":519.933,"stop":538.582,"duration":18.65},{"text":"And he awaited that determination before he filed his suit.","start":538.582,"stop":542.939,"duration":4.36},{"text":"However, neither the district court nor the court of appeals considered this sufficient to meet the exhaustion requirement each believed should be imposed.","start":542.939,"stop":554.137,"duration":11.2},{"text":"Instead, they articulated an exhaustion requirement analogous to that imposed on Federal employees who are seeking relief under title VII for race, sex, religion, national origin, or color-based discrimination.","start":554.137,"stop":569.115,"duration":14.98},{"text":"And that exhaustion requirement does, under the precedent of this Court and the express terms of that statute, bar review on the merits of a claim if the administrative process has been invoked in an untimely fashion as it was here.","start":569.115,"stop":583.391,"duration":14.28},{"text":"The clear language of section... of the ADEA, however, distinguishes the ADEA of... from title VII with respect to the conditions they impose on seeking Federal relief.","start":583.391,"stop":598.729,"duration":15.34},{"text":"As noted, the ADEA requires only that civil action be proceeded by a brief notice period during which the prospective defendant may learn of the claim and remove the cause for it if that is possible within the time frame.","start":598.729,"stop":614.363,"duration":15.63},{"text":"In contract, title VII expressly conditions district court jurisdiction on the aggrieved employee's participation in the administrative process and specifically ties the jurisdiction of the Federal court and the right of the employee to file his or her suit to the date on which the administrative process is either concluded or deemed by statute to have been exhausted by the elapsing of a 180-day period.","start":614.363,"stop":645.366,"duration":31},{"text":"In light of these differences, the analogy to title VII is clearly inappropriate and should be rejected by this Court.","start":645.366,"stop":655.018,"duration":9.65},{"text":"The courts below have... will... who have found such an exhaustion requirement have relied heavily on that analogy.","start":655.018,"stop":663.92,"duration":8.9},{"text":"An interpretation requiring exhaustion has also been rejected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is the agency charged by both statutes with implementing the administrative enforcement procedures under those statutes.","start":663.92,"stop":680.726,"duration":16.81},{"text":"Under its customary practice, this Court should defer to this interpretation should it need to look at any other body after reviewing plain language of the statute, because this is clearly a very plausible reading of the statute, consistent with its purpose, and because this is a longstanding interpretation by the agency charged with the enforcement of the statute on the basis of the agency expertise.","start":680.726,"stop":707.732,"duration":27.01}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"How does the agency get to rule on that particular
