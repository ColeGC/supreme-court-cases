labor agreements are a form of contract, the statutory exemption does not apply to them and to the claims asserted by the unions in these cases.","start":338.197,"stop":347.684,"duration":9.49},{"text":"Now that decision of the court of appeals was surely incorrect.","start":347.684,"stop":351.187,"duration":3.5},{"text":"Contractual
