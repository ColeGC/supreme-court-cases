those that apply to all fertile women... if upheld, would keep women from a broad range of jobs because there are, in fact, a broad range of jobs that present potential fetal risks due to toxics, but

of this type, therefore, would be to sanction the resegregation of the work force, particularly because the economics of the situation are that employers are going to instill fetal protection policies in instances in which they are not dependent on women workers for their work force and not instigate them where they are highly dependent on women workers, because then they would have nobody to do the job.","start":601.236,"stop":630.304,"duration":29.07},{"text":"So the effect is that women will end up in the jobs where they began before title VII was passed... that is, in child care centers,

indispensable.","start":630.304,"stop":644.275,"duration":13.97},{"text":"The net effect is that this policy, if upheld, would cut the heart out of title VII and out of the Pregnancy Discrimination

health.","start":677.036,"stop":688.163,"duration":11.13},{"text":"I will proceed in a moment to outline the three reasons why we think that that is simply wrong, but first I'd like to respond briefly

protecting fetal health.","start":698.301,"stop":706.938,"duration":8.64},{"text":"First of all, the issue of fetal health is far more complicated than the employer admits.","start":706.938,"stop":712.041,"duration":5.1},{"text":"To understand why, let's consider two possible scenarios.","start":712.041,"stop":716.252,"duration":4.21},{"text":"First of all, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act history demonstrates that women work because they have to, and it demonstrates as well and emphatically, and this was discussed at some length on the floor and also in the hearings, that there is a major danger to fetal health due to maternal poverty and also due to an inability of women to have prenatal care if they're unemployed, and that those dangers are similar to the sorts of dangers Johnson Controls is claiming here.","start":716.252,"stop":749.455,"duration":33.2},{"text":"They are dangers of retardation, neurological damage, and so on.","start":749.455,"stop":753.328,"duration":3.87},{"text":"If many employers adopt fetal protection policies, as I've suggested they might if Johnson Controls' principles were upheld here today, the net result will be that many women will not have adequate income and will be relegating their children to precisely those fetal harms which Congress was in fact trying to prevent in passing the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.","start":753.328,"stop":777.585,"duration":24.26},{"text":"The other possibility is that many... some employers protect these... won't institute fetal protection policies for reasons of the sort I alluded to earlier.","start":777.585,"stop":786.37,"duration":8.78},{"text":"That is, because they are the employers who are dependent on female workers.","start":786.37,"stop":790.503,"duration":4.13},{"text":"If that happens, women may have jobs in those workplaces, but they are traditionally lower paid, and also they do not necessarily have lesser fetal risks.","start":790.503,"stop":800.281,"duration":9.78},{"text":"They simply have different fetal risks.","start":800.281,"stop":802.524,"duration":2.24},{"text":"A related point about the social context of this case, or the larger context of this case, is that the issue here really, therefore, is not whether fetal health is going to be protected, but how and by whom.","start":802.524,"stop":817.364,"duration":14.84},{"text":"Obviously, an employer is welcome and ought to be protecting fetal health to the highest degree possible, as long as he doesn't exclude women from the workplace, but in addition, there are two other decision makers here.","start":817.364,"stop":829.261,"duration":11.9},{"text":"There's the woman, and there's the Government.","start":829.261,"stop":831.134,"duration":1.87},{"text":"The Government in this instance, in OSHA... the Occupational Safety and Health Administration... deciding the lead standard in

occupational safety and health concerns.","start":831.134,"stop":859.212,"duration":28.08},{"text":"Interestingly, note that the language of OSHA is the same... section 38 of OSHA... as the BFOQ:
