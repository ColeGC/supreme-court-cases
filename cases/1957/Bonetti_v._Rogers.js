was deported, consisted of Bonetti's own admission, namely, the testimony that he gave before the Board of Special Inquiry at his exclusion hearing in 1938, the statement that he made on his alien registration form which asked the question what organizations had he ever belonged to.","start":360.767,"stop":390.536,"duration":29.77},{"text":"The statements he made to officials of the immigration

affirmed by the Court of Appeals.","start":428.888,"stop":433.144,"duration":4.26},{"text":"Now, the statute under which petitioner was ordered deported, that is the Internal Security Act, as well as the current Immigration and Nationality Act, which the court below mistakenly could apply, but which technically does not apply, but we make no point to that because obviously, both acts should have to be interpreted the same.","start":433.144,"stop":456.802,"duration":23.66},{"text":"But both statutes provide for the expulsion of any alien who was a member of the Communist Party at the time of or after entry.","start":456.802,"stop":468.67,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Neither statute provides for expulsion of an alien merely on account of Communist Party membership before entry.","start":468.67,"stop":478.894,"duration":10.22},{"text":"In this case, the alien made three entries, in 1923, 1938 and 1939,

not a member of the Communist Party after or at the time of, either of his last two entries.","start":492.531,"stop":500.332,"duration":7.8},{"text":"So the precise question of statutory construction,

States.\"","start":500.332,"stop":520.909,"duration":20.58},{"text":"Now, we believe that the statute refers only to Communist Party membership after the last of several entries and if we are right, then the petitioner is obviously not deportable under the statute.","start":520.909,"stop":534.848,"duration":13.94},{"text":"But before turning to the affirmative reasons in favor of this interpretation, I want to deal first with the grounds on which the court below held that after entry or after entering in the statute, means after any of several entries or after any (Inaudible).","start":534.848,"stop":555.184,"duration":20.34},{"text":"The court below pointed out that the word \"entry\" is defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act, to mean subject to limitations that don't apply here, \"Any coming of an alien into the United States from a foreign place.\"","start":555.184,"stop":574.101,"duration":18.92},{"text":"This definition corresponds to and was derived from the case definition which had evolved prior to the Immigration and Nationality Act.","start":574.101,"stop":585.731,"duration":11.63},{"text":"The court below said, “Well, since an entry is any coming, a statute which expels for a membership after entry means membership after any entry.\"","start":585.731,"stop":598.458,"duration":12.73},{"text":"Now, this is plainly a non sequitur.","start":598.458,"stop":602.851,"duration":4.39},{"text":"The statutory definition of entry merely describes what kind of an arrival constitutes an entry.","start":602.851,"stop":612.025,"duration":9.17},{"text":"The phrase, \"any coming\" is used in the section qualitatively, as it were to mean a coming of any kind subject to certain specified exceptions.","start":612.025,"stop":623.672,"duration":11.65},{"text":"For example, it means the coming for permanent residents or as a visitor, or as a seaman, or in transit, or as stow away.","start":623.672,"stop":634.069,"duration":10.4},{"text":"The exclusions from the definition are also qualitative.","start":634.069,"stop":639.324,"duration":5.25},{"text":"For example, an entry doesn't include a coming preceded an involuntary departure, nor does it include a coming which consist of a passage by sea from one American port to another, although exceptions being -- having been first developed by cases in this Court.","start":639.324,"stop":658.7,"duration":19.38},{"text":"Now, it's simply a distortion of language to treat a definition of what kind of conduct, what kind of coming constitutes an entry as -- is positive of which particular coming of several comings, is referred to by other sections of the Act.","start":658.7,"stop":678.228,"duration":19.53},{"text":"The
