Labor Relations Act, an employer may insist as a condition of a collective-bargaining agreement that the bargaining representative agree not to call a strike over any dispute which the parties aren't able to settle through negotiations including the termination or modification of the collective-bargaining agreement until all of the employees in the bargaining unit have had an opportunity to vote on whether to accept or reject the company's last offer.","start":35.392,"stop":72.821,"duration":37.43},{"text":"The second question presented in this case is whether under the Act, an employer may

clause.","start":111.746,"stop":120.059,"duration":8.31},{"text":"Briefly, the Board held that the employer's insistence upon these two clauses, as a condition of the collective-bargaining agreement, violated the bargaining requirements of the statute.","start":120.059,"stop":131.874,"duration":11.81},{"text":"The court below, on the other hand, while agreeing with the Board with respect to the recognition clause that the employer's insistence upon having this contract solely with the Local rather than the International which you can certify, did violate the bargaining requirements of the

clause.","start":131.874,"stop":154.693,"duration":22.82},{"text":"The facts which give rise to these two questions that are before us are not in dispute and I shall summarize them quite briefly.","start":154.693,"stop":165.017,"duration":10.32},{"text":"In 1952, following the election among the company's employees, the Board certified as their bargaining representative the International Union United Automobile Workers.","start":165.017,"stop":177.38,"duration":12.36},{"text":"Shortly after the International was certified, it chartered a local which admitted to membership employees of a company at this particular plant.","start":177.38,"stop":189.119,"duration":11.74},{"text":"Shortly after the Local had been charted and the representatives of the

agreement.","start":189.119,"stop":203.558,"duration":14.44},{"text":"These negotiations continued for a period of several months and finally culminated in an unsuccessful strike.","start":203.558,"stop":210.116,"duration":6.56},{"text":"At the end of the unsuccessful strike the Local -- the Local but not the International, the Local accepted the company's terms including the two clauses that I've mentioned and the men, of course, returned to work.","start":210.116,"stop":223.544,"duration":13.43},{"text":"Now, going back to the negotiations and what took place there at the beginning of the negotiations, the International proposed a contract which would be between the company, on the one hand, and the International and it's Local as co-parties.","start":223.544,"stop":239.878,"duration":16.33},{"text":"The International also proposed to the company a “no-strike” clause with respect to matters which would be the subject matter of arbitration under its proposed contract.","start":239.878,"stop":251.503,"duration":11.63},{"text":"The company, on the other hand, proposed a contract which named only the Local of the International

proposals.","start":322.235,"stop":330.778,"duration":8.54},{"text":"The company explained these two proposals in this fashion.","start":330.778,"stop":336.257,"duration":5.48},{"text":"It -- it explained this -- the so-called recognition clause that the contract should be with the Local rather than certified International on the ground that the Local was more familiar with the local plant conditions and that therefore it should have the right to have its own contract.","start":336.257,"stop":353.074,"duration":16.82},{"text":"It explained the strike ballot clause on two grounds.","start":353.074,"stop":357.529,"duration":4.45},{"text":"First of all, that it would enable it to have a better understanding of what the employees wanted and that it would permit the company to reexamine if necessary its position in the light of their wishes.","start":357.529,"stop":369.839,"duration":12.31},{"text":"And secondly, that it was designed to prevent -- I think to

which follow, I might say the union rejected both proposals.","start":383.905,"stop":393.182,"duration":9.28},{"text":"In the negotiations which followed, the company continued to insist upon these two clauses.","start":393.182,"stop":399.074,"duration":5.89},{"text":"It made a slight modification in the so-called recognition clause and to change the recognition clause so that -- that the union would be designated as Local 1238 of International Union, United Automobile Workers instead of Local 1238 affiliated with.","start":399.074,"stop":417.052,"duration":17.98},{"text":"But the change, nevertheless, continued to reflect the company's stated purpose that the contract should be with the Local rather than the International which the Board had certified.","start":417.052,"stop":428.041,"duration":10.99},{"text":"The company also modified somewhat it's -- the ballot clause so that to -- in -- so that, and perhaps I omitted this, that the original ballot proposal as proposed by the company further provided that the contract was not to be terminated until after the employees are also -- have a vote -- to vote upon that matter.","start":428.041,"stop":454.156,"duration":26.12},{"text":"In its final revision of this proposal the company included the question of -- of amendment and or modification of the contract as well as its termination.","start":454.156,"stop":463.495,"duration":9.34},{"text":"In other words, before the contract could be -- if there dispute as to the terminating or modifying the contract the company's final proposal or it would have to be submitted to the employees for a vote as to whether they accept or reject.","start":463.495,"stop":477.98,"duration":14.49},{"text":"The -- throughout the negotiations the company made it clear that agreement was contingent upon the union's acceptance of these clauses, these so-called ballot and recognition clauses.","start":477.98,"stop":495.243,"duration":17.26},{"text":"The union for it part resisted these two proposals, informed the company that agreement would not be possible as long as this company

union were also -- and lowered their heads on other matters and as a consequence a strike was called and the strike, as I've indicated, was unsuccessful and at the conclusion for the strike the Local,
