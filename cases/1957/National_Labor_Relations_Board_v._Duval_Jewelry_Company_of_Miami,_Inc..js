the underlying facts are these.","start":260.362,"stop":265.249,"duration":4.89},{"text":"In November of 1955, a union, the retail clerks filed the petition with the Board's regional office for a

served.","start":305.34,"stop":316.64,"duration":11.3},{"text":"They were issued to the store where the union was claiming representation rights and to three other stores allegedly part of the same intrastate chain, because under the Board's jurisdictional yardsticks, jurisdiction will be asserted over an intrastate retail store if its out of state purchases meet a certain figure and even if the purchases of the particular store do not satisfy the standard if the store is part of a chain and the total purchases of the stores is in the chain meet the figure then jurisdiction will be asserted.","start":316.64,"stop":356.241,"duration":39.6},{"text":"So that the subpoenas here requested, merely, sufficient information to ascertain whether or not the Board's chain store standard was met.","start":356.241,"stop":368.766,"duration":12.53},{"text":"They were issued in accordance with the procedures similar to that followed under the federal rules of civil procedure.","start":368.766,"stop":376.679,"duration":7.91},{"text":"That is, the Board attorney assigned to the case made application to the regional director setting forth the person to be subpoenaed and the information sought and the regional director issued the attorney blank subpoenas bearing the seal of the Board and the facsimile signature of a Board member and were filled-in by the attorney and served.","start":376.679,"stop":403.648,"duration":26.97},{"text":"Now, upon service of the subpoenas, the respondents filed petitions to revoke the subpoena alleging that they were burdensome and has not been properly issued which petitions were addressed to and filed with the Board in Washington.","start":403.648,"stop":424.238,"duration":20.59},{"text":"And copies were sent to the hearing officer in Miami.","start":424.238,"stop":428.408,"duration":4.17},{"text":"The executive secretary of the Board returned the petitions calling respondents' attention to the provision of the Board's rules herein issue which requires that these petitions be filed with the hearing officer.","start":428.408,"stop":442.756,"duration":14.35},{"text":"The hearing officer then fixed a date for respondents to file briefs and argue orally in support of the petitions which respondents declined to avail themselves of and the hearing officer proceeded to deny the petitions to revoke on the ground that they presented no substantial issue as to the validity of the subpoenas.","start":442.756,"stop":464.923,"duration":22.17},{"text":"And when the hearing was reconvened, respondents appeared through counsel and indicated they would not comply with the subpoenas, whereupon, pursuant to Section 11 (2) of the Act the Board then instituted proceedings to enforce the subpoenas in the District Court.","start":464.923,"stop":483.924,"duration":19},{"text":"The District Court denied enforcement of the subpoenas on the ground that they were unreasonable and oppressive and were

Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, agreed that the subpoena should not be enforced but for a different reason.","start":500.727,"stop":510.03,"duration":9.3},{"text":"The court was of the views that this Board procedure or ruling on this petition to revoke in the first instance by the hearing officer, constituted an unauthorized delegation of authority to the hearing officer.","start":510.03,"stop":527.519,"duration":17.49},{"text":"And since the Board itself had not passed on respondents' petitions to revoke, the suit in the Court's view was thus premature and

of all, that properly understood, the Board's procedure for revocation of subpoenas does not present a delegation problem at all and that the Board itself retains the power of final decision through this appeal procedure which I've indicated at the outset.","start":545.443,"stop":569.331,"duration":23.89},{"text":"In the alternative, however, we submit that even if the Board's procedure were viewed as entailing a delegation of Board authority with the hearing officer, the Act does not preclude such delegation.","start":569.331,"stop":594.845,"duration":25.51},{"text":"Now, I've indicated briefly that under this procedure, the Board requires that the petition to revoke first be filed with the hearing officer.","start":594.845,"stop":606.73,"duration":11.88},{"text":"Now, in an unfair labor practice, this hearing officer is a trial examiner with the independent status conferred by the Administrative Procedure Act.","start":606.73,"stop":616.244,"duration":9.51},{"text":"That's the situation in the case which follows.","start":616.244,"stop":620.346,"duration":4.1},{"text":"In a representation case, such as we have here, he is a field examiner or attorney under staff of the regional office.","start":620.346,"stop":628.914,"duration":8.57},{"text":"The reason for the difference is that a representation case is essentially an investigation and not -- not necessary a type of proceeding and is exempt from the hearing requirements of the APA.","start":628.914,"stop":646.378,"duration":17.46},{"text":"In such cases, the Board is thus free, not restricted to the panel of hearing officers setup under that Act and can utilize other qualified personnel for the hearing officer function.","start":646.378,"stop":662.237,"duration":15.86},{"text":"However, apart from the fact that the hearing officer in the -- our case does not make recommendations to the Board.","start":662.237,"stop":673.593,"duration":11.36},{"text":"His function at the hearing is otherwise is responsible as that of a trial examiner in an unfair labor practice case.","start":673.593,"stop":681.826,"duration":8.23},{"text":"He may call on and examine witnesses, rule on the admissibility of evidence, regulate the course of the hearing and ensure that it's his job to see that a full and complete record is developed for the Board.","start":681.826,"stop":699.866,"duration":18.04},{"text":"Now, if a party is dissatisfied with the hearing officer's action on the petition to revoke, the Board's procedure as I indicated at the outset affords the party an opportunity to apply to the Board for permission to appeal specially and if a substantial question is presented, the Board will entertain the appeal.","start":699.866,"stop":724.225,"duration":24.36},{"text":"Moreover, there is opportunity when the case is before the Board for final decision to obtain Board review of the subpoena question.","start":724.225,"stop":735.642,"duration":11.42},{"text":"Now, of course, that does not afford an adequate remedy in the situation where the hearing officer has denied the petition to revoke but where he grants a petition to revoke the subpoena.","start":735.642,"stop":749.558,"duration":13.92},{"text":"And the party aggrieved is the person requesting the subpoena.","start":749.558,"stop":754.756,"duration":5.2},{"text":"He is afforded an opportunity to obtain Board review in regress of that situation when the case comes before the Board for final decision because the board can as it has in such cases ordered the hearing reopened should it find that the evidence denied to the individual was material.","start":754.756,"stop":775.658,"duration":20.9}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"(Inaudible)","start":775.658,"stop":795.335,"duration":19.68}]},{"speakerName":"Norton J.
