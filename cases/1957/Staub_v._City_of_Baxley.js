took place and the trial followed in the Mayor's Court of the City of Baxley.","start":478.735,"stop":489.779,"duration":11.04},{"text":"In the Mayor's Court, the two organizers, Staub and Merritt,

this Court.","start":489.779,"stop":507.555,"duration":17.78},{"text":"He did show that, and I may add had that these constitutional questions were preserved at every later stage of the appeals

speedily, the union instituted a declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court of Georgia.","start":541.462,"stop":558.8,"duration":17.34},{"text":"I think immediately after the arrest as I recall, the Superior Court judge dismissed the complaint in the declaratory judgment action of which we sought to restrain the holding of the trial on the ground that the statute, the ordinance was unconstitutional.","start":558.8,"stop":574.356,"duration":15.56},{"text":"And we took an appeal from that dismissal directly to the Supreme Court of Georgia which sustained the dismissal of the declaratory judgment complaint.","start":574.356,"stop":585.804,"duration":11.45},{"text":"And thereupon, the Mayor's Court conviction or a criminal proceeding as I should say, continued.","start":585.804,"stop":596.723,"duration":10.92},{"text":"After the conviction took place, we took an appeal to the next layer of the Georgia courts which is the Superior Court.","start":596.723,"stop":609.656,"duration":12.93},{"text":"I want to tell you that in order to take such an appeal, you have to file a bond.","start":609.656,"stop":618.203,"duration":8.55},{"text":"And immediately after the conviction on -- in March 1954, the very same afternoon or evening, our counsel presented that fine to the clerk of the court and asked, “Are you the clerk of the Mayor's Court?”","start":618.203,"stop":639.061,"duration":20.86},{"text":"Because on the Georgia procedure, if she was the clerk of the Mayor's Court, then she had it countersigned or approved the bond.","start":639.061,"stop":645.51,"duration":6.45},{"text":"If there wasn't a clerk, the mayor himself had to do so.","start":645.51,"stop":648.656,"duration":3.15},{"text":"Being assured that she was the clerk of the Mayor's Court, he handed her the bond with typewritten words on it saying the clerk of the Mayor's Court, she signed it.","start":648.656,"stop":657.072,"duration":8.42},{"text":"We took the appeal to the Superior Court and after a while, the city moved to dismiss on the ground that she

Council.","start":664.056,"stop":666.584,"duration":2.53},{"text":"And the Superior Court threw out that appeal without appeal.","start":666.584,"stop":671.052,"duration":4.47},{"text":"Well, on a further appeal to the Georgia courts, that was reversed and it came back to the Superior Court with instructions to hear our appeal on the merits, the bond was sufficient.","start":671.052,"stop":681.018,"duration":9.97},{"text":"There, we were again on merits.","start":681.018,"stop":683.164,"duration":2.15},{"text":"This time the Superior Court denies the appeal again, and despite the fact that the constitutional questions had been fully presented, it will -- no opinion at all denied on the conviction.","start":683.164,"stop":698.413,"duration":15.25},{"text":"We then appealed to the Court of Appeals which is the next mayor and the Georgia

appeal.","start":706.565,"stop":714.906,"duration":8.34},{"text":"But the Court didn't pass on the constitutionality at all and said it's unnecessary to do so, and why?","start":714.906,"stop":723.294,"duration":8.39},{"text":"Well, two reasons, the Court assigned.","start":723.294,"stop":726.573,"duration":3.28},{"text":"One, that if Staub wanted to challenge this ordinance, she should have applied for a permit first.","start":726.573,"stop":739.339,"duration":12.77},{"text":"And having failed to apply to affirm it under the ordinance, she had no standing to challenge.","start":739.339,"stop":747.003,"duration":7.66},{"text":"This ground by the way, is one which had been ruled out specifically by this very Court in Lovell against Griffin, not too many years before, also at Georgia case and which was presented to this Court of Appeals again in -- in our briefs and again on rehearing, again they -- they never mentioned Lovell against Griffin.","start":747.003,"stop":765.116,"duration":18.11},{"text":"But as I say, held that we had no standing to challenge this ordinance because we haven't applied for a permit under it.","start":765.116,"stop":772.237,"duration":7.12},{"text":"The second ground they assigned was that we had challenged the ordinance as an entirety instead of specifying which of these nine sections we thought were unconstitutional, but we thought all of them unconstitutional.","start":772.237,"stop":787.215,"duration":14.98},{"text":"The ordinance only relates to one subject matter, and we challenged the entire ordinance.","start":787.215,"stop":792.836,"duration":5.62},{"text":"And as we make clear in our brief, both under Georgia practice, that was the proper procedure.","start":792.836,"stop":801.421,"duration":8.59},{"text":"The Georgia Supreme Court has held that.","start":801.421,"stop":803.466,"duration":2.04},{"text":"And a state court cannot deny our rights to challenge an ordinance on federal grounds by preventing us from attacking an entire ordinance when in fact the entire ordinance is invalid.","start":803.466,"stop":815.977,"duration":12.51},{"text":"Anyway, the Court of Appeals denied our application for hearing.","start":815.977,"stop":821.606,"duration":5.63},{"text":"The Supreme Court of Georgia denied an application for certiorari without any opinion and we then came to this Court which noted probable jurisdiction.","start":821.606,"stop":830.229,"duration":8.62},{"text":"Now, we challenge this ordinance on a number of grounds, claiming first that it violates our rights under the First Amendment to engage in associational activities to speak freely, to write freely to assemble.","start":830.229,"stop":853.13,"duration":22.9},{"text":"That it violates our rights under the due process clause of the Constitution, that it violates our rights under the Equal Protection Clause.","start":853.13,"stop":861.393,"duration":8.26},{"text":"And finally, since this is a company which engages an interstate commerce, the workers of which in Hazelhurst Manufacturing Company.","start":861.393,"stop":868.913,"duration":7.52},{"text":"That factually has no power to present qualifications on the
