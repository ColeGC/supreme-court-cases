immaterial.","start":454.661,"stop":459.524,"duration":4.86},{"text":"Now obviously if later on once the motor authority has recognized in put into being, then the Commission always have authority

point in this case Mr. Justice Burton.","start":473.59,"stop":479.037,"duration":5.45},{"text":"The Bowles case of course was decided as I said before 1937, prior to the Transportation Act of 1940.","start":479.037,"stop":486.8,"duration":7.76},{"text":"Even then the provisions of Section 202 (a) of the Motor Carrier Act, among other things, required the Commission to preserve the inherit advantages of motor transportation.","start":486.8,"stop":495.653,"duration":8.85},{"text":"And in the Bowles case there Commission referred among other things to that requirement of the statute and based on that requirement ultimately concluded, as I said before, that shippers are entitled to adequate motor as well as rail service.","start":495.653,"stop":509.669,"duration":14.02},{"text":"And so our position is that when Congress in 1940 substantially reenacted as a part of the National Transportation Policy, the provisions of Section 202 (a) of the Motor Carrier Act, if approved the Commission's consistent construction, which had previously been said forth and to which I previously referred.","start":509.669,"stop":530.073,"duration":20.4},{"text":"Now here we encounter two arguments from the appellees.","start":530.073,"stop":533.846,"duration":3.77},{"text":"First the railroad say, and I think they have to say it of necessity, that Section 202 (a) the Motor Carrier Act was repealed by the Transportation Act of 1940 and that the National Transportation Policy which was then enacted, required the Commission to change its rule of decision embodied in the Bowles case.","start":533.846,"stop":551.89,"duration":18.04},{"text":"Well first of all of course if that is so the Commission waited a mighty long time to change its rule decision, but that's more or less beside the point.","start":551.89,"stop":560.355,"duration":8.47},{"text":"The first thing wrong with this rail argument I think is a fact that it overlooks the fact that when Congress enacted the National Transportation Policy, to a large extent it was simply putting in one package, requirements which were already imposed on the Commission by provisions of other statutes.","start":560.355,"stop":577.457,"duration":17.1},{"text":"For example, and I am reverting again to Bowles, the Commission said there we're advised by statute that it is the policy of Congress to foster and preserve in full vigor both rail and water transportation.","start":577.457,"stop":589.432,"duration":11.98},{"text":"Now that reference of course was to the Transportation Act of 1920, but the Commission went on to point out, as I said that, it was also required to preserve the inherited advantages of motor transport and it reached the ultimate conclusion that the shippers were entitled to both forms of service.","start":589.432,"stop":605.024,"duration":15.59},{"text":"Now I think the best way to demonstrate, the second thing wrong with this rail argument, because it's essentially similar to the contentions I'm coming to, is to refer to the report of the entire Commission in Greyhound Corporation Control, Florida Motorlines Corp.","start":605.024,"stop":620.152,"duration":15.13},{"text":"Now while we have citied a good many cases in our brief, I'm frank to say we didn't cite that, but it's after (Inaudible) and I would like to quote it.","start":620.152,"stop":628.808,"duration":8.66},{"text":"The Commission there said this, “Greyhound also contends that in enacting the Transportation Act of 1940, Congress recognized that the emphasis which both it and the Commission have theretofore put upon the desirability of preserving competition between carriers engaged in the same mode of transportation was no longer necessary.”","start":628.808,"stop":648.008,"duration":19.2},{"text":"Skipping a few extraneous words, “There is nothing in the transportation policy which indicates that Congress intended that the preservation of competition among operators in the motor bus transportation field should be considered any less important than in other types of transportation or that the long established policy of preserving reasonable competition in transportation should be discarded.","start":648.008,"stop":671.578,"duration":23.57},{"text":"The administration of the Act so as to preserve the inherent advantage of each mode of transportation requires continued competition, among bus operators, striving to render the best possible service to the travelling public and the spec of competition goes far to encourage the establishment and maintenance of reasonable charges for transportation service without undue preferences or advantages or disruptive competitive practices,” and the ultimate conclusion that the Commission reached there was this.","start":671.578,"stop":698.795,"duration":27.22},{"text":"“We are unable to agree with Greyhound's contention that Congress intended to substitute our regulation for the long established elements of competition in the field of motor bus transportation.”","start":698.795,"stop":710.424,"duration":11.63},{"text":"Well of course what they said there by motor bus transportation is equally applicable to motor truck transportation.","start":710.424,"stop":716.953,"duration":6.53},{"text":"Now the second argument that we meet comes primarily from the Commission, which says that we lay too much stress on the inherent advantages provisions of the National Transportation Policy and that we in effect overlook the other provisions of the policy.","start":716.953,"stop":731.009,"duration":14.06},{"text":"The Commission says on the contrary, that when it denied Schaffer's application, it took into account all of the provisions of the policy.","start":731.009,"stop":739.177,"duration":8.17},{"text":"Now let me, if I may, attempt an analysis of the decision here to demonstrate just how it took in the account these various provisions.","start":739.177,"stop":746.741,"duration":7.56},{"text":"First, and admittedly it protects the railroads against Schaffer's proposed competition both rate and service wise.","start":746.741,"stop":753.919,"duration":7.18},{"text":"And I assume the Commission will argue that in doing so it thus preserved the inherent advantages of rail service.","start":753.919,"stop":761.295,"duration":7.38},{"text":"But even so, the Commission's brief itself notes that even if the application had been granted, the shippers involved would have continued to use rail carload service.","start":761.295,"stop":770.833,"duration":9.54},{"text":"And so a grant of Schaffer's application would have recognized the inherent advantages of both modes of transportation, instead of excluding the one in favor of the other.","start":770.833,"stop":781.212,"duration":10.38},{"text":"So we say that right off the bat, the Commission's decision violates the cardinal rule, that every part of a statute must be construed in connection with the whole, so as to make all the parts harmonize if possible and gives meaning to each, and of course that's Washington Market case which is cited in our reply brief at page five.","start":781.212,"stop":799.896,"duration":18.68},{"text":"The second thing wrong with the Commission's decision here is that it positively ignores its obligation under the National Transportation Policy to promote adequate economic and efficient service.","start":799.896,"stop":810.797,"duration":10.9},{"text":"I've already referred to the Greyhound case in which the Commission made it clear that reasonable competition is necessary if these aims of the policy are to be accomplished.","start":810.797,"stop":820.43,"duration":9.63},{"text":"We've also dealt with this subject at some length in our original brief and I won't say more here except to point out the obvious, and that is that the Commission's decisions maintaining as it does a rail monopoly can scarcely be said to promote adequate economic and efficient service as required by the National Transportation Policy.","start":820.43,"stop":839.99,"duration":19.56},{"text":"So if I may on this phase of the case, let me sum up by just trying to see how the Commission balanced these various requirements.","start":839.99,"stop":847.66,"duration":7.67},{"text":"As stated, we concede that the Commission sought to preserve the inherent advantages of rail service, but I've pointed out that, that was not necessary, that even if Schaffer's application had been granted, the railroad's inherent advantage would not have been destroyed, but look at the other side of the ledger.","start":847.66,"stop":863.602,"duration":15.94},{"text":"The Commission denied the shippers the inherent advantages of motor service and in doing so failed to provide the fair and impartial regulations of all modes of transportation, which again is required by the National Transportation Policy.","start":863.602,"stop":876.563,"duration":12.96},{"text":"By maintaining the existing rail monopoly, the Commission fails to promote adequate, economical and efficient service and fails to encourage the establishment and maintenance of reasonable charges.","start":876.563,"stop":887.58,"duration":11.02},{"text":"And for this reasons we say that the Commission's contention that its decision here took into account all of the provisions of the National Transportation Policy simply doesn't hold water.","start":887.58,"stop":897.886,"duration":10.31},{"text":"It would be far more accurate to say that the Commission's decision here just ignores the provisions of the policy.","start":897.886,"stop":904.375,"duration":6.49},{"text":"Now in their briefs, the appellees have made several arguments which we don't believe are properly available to them before the Court, for the reason that first they find no support in the record itself, second they are not even discussed in the report of the Commission which i before the Court.","start":904.375,"stop":922.672,"duration":18.3},{"text":"The first argument I'd like to touch on is the Commission's argument that in denying Schaffer's application it was complying with the requirement of the National Transportation Policy that it foster sound economic conditions in transportation.","start":922.672,"stop":938.276,"duration":15.6},{"text":"Now I assume this means that if in a given case the Commission has found that a grant of authority to a motor carriage would have such serious repercussions on the existing rail service as to make it less able to function (Inaudible) then it might deny the motor authority for that reason.","start":938.276,"stop":957.475,"duration":19.2},{"text":"Well, first we seriously doubt the validity of that theory, but I don't really need to make any attempt to repudiate it here because there isn't a bit of a evidence in the record to support the claim that Schaffer's proposed operations would have any serious impact at all on the Commission and it isn't even mentioned in the Commission's report, and probably because the Commission didn't want to get laughed out of court by making such a comment.","start":957.475,"stop":982.355,"duration":24.88},{"text":"Now what I said here is applicable equally to the rather lengthy discussion of other statutes, which occupy 16 pages in the rail brief, at pages 24 to 40 of their brief.","start":982.355,"stop":993.787,"duration":11.43},{"text":"Now if we understand the argument that they put out there, it is that the Commission again has discretion to deny a motor authority where any serious impact would exist, would be effected upon the rail service, but we don't have to meet with that argument.","start":993.787,"stop":1007.819,"duration":14.03},{"text":"We've dealt in some detail in our reply with this phase of the case and I think I'll just leave it there if I may.","start":1007.819,"stop":1015.094,"duration":7.28},{"text":"The second argument, not available to the Commission here, is that the traffic available wouldn't support Schaffer's proposed operation, again nothing in the record to support that contention and the subject is not discussed in the Commission's report.","start":1015.094,"stop":1027.858,"duration":12.76},{"text":"As a matter of fact if the Court will turn to the only point where I find it discussed outside of the examiner's report, is the report of Division 5 at record 22, it's noted that the division said the proposed service would tie in nicely with Schaffer's existing service and at the times available would enable Schaffer to provide an efficient and economical service.","start":1027.858,"stop":1049.487,"duration":21.63},{"text":"Now the third argument and it's fair to say that only the Commission makes it, is that shippers supporting Schaffer should have used the service of existing motor carriers before seeking additional service.","start":1049.487,"stop":1061.219,"duration":11.73},{"text":"Well the short answer to that is there simply isn't any existing motor service and the railroads admit it, in their question presented in their brief at page one of their brief and in their statement of the case, they make it clear that there isn't any motor service.","start":1061.219,"stop":1073.839,"duration":12.62},{"text":"Despite this, the Commission's brief refers to cases, which hold that existing motor carriers are entitled to transport all the traffic they can handle adequately, economically and efficiently without the competition of a new motor carrier service.","start":1073.839,"stop":1086.859,"duration":13.02},{"text":"We have no problem with those cases, except they have no application here.","start":1086.859,"stop":1090.9,"duration":4.04},{"text":"To the extent that Division 5 denied the authority requested by Schaffer's insofar as it duplicated the existing service of the one motor protestant (Inaudible), it conformed to that theory.","start":1090.9,"stop":1103.74,"duration":12.84},{"text":"Commission's brief also tells us that the decision in the (Inaudible) case, which is (Inaudible) versus US 139, Fed Sub 440 supports this decision here.","start":1103.74,"stop":1115.102,"duration":11.36},{"text":"Now really nothing could be farther from the fact.","start":1115.102,"stop":1117.912,"duration":2.81},{"text":"In that case, the plaintiff did allege that his application was denied because rail service was held to be adequate, but here is what the Court said about that allegation and I'm quoting from 139 Fed Sub 443, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the United States both take the position that this issue does not arise because they say that there is ample evidence in the record before the Commission to the effect that there is also motor carrier service available to serve the points involved in the complainant's application and the Court went on to hold that, that was the fact in that case, which of course is decided is not the fact here.","start":1117.912,"stop":1154.997,"duration":37.09},{"text":"Coming next to the Commission's argument about lower rates, their additional contention that in addition to the fact that they found that existing rail service was adequate, there is something reprehensible and shippers warning lower rates by motor carrier, and that's not a good reason for granting an application.","start":1154.997,"stop":1170.943,"duration":15.95},{"text":"Now we have dealt with this argument rather extensively in our reply brief, and I just want to touch on it here.","start":1170.943,"stop":1178.235,"duration":7.29},{"text":"Going to back Commission's holding again in the (Inaudible), as I stated before, if shippers are entitled to adequate motor as well as rail service, then what earthly difference does it make, what's in the back of their mind when they come before the Commission and ask to have this service made available to them which does not presently exist.","start":1178.235,"stop":1198.678,"duration":20.44},{"text":"I refer to this Court's decision in the Mechling case, in which you said this at 330 U.S. 567.","start":1198.678,"stop":1205.99,"duration":7.31},{"text":"You previously have referred in that decision through the provisions of the National Transportation Policy and certain provisions of the Transportation Act of 1940.","start":1205.99,"stop":1214.154,"duration":8.16},{"text":"And the court went on to say, “The foregoing provisions flatly forbid the Commission to approve barge rates or barge rail rates, which do not preserve intact the inherit advantages of cheaper motor -- cheaper water transportation, but discriminate against as water carrier and the goods they transport.”","start":1214.154,"stop":1231.993,"duration":17.84},{"text":"Now the Commission has frequently held that motor transportation has certain inherited advantages, which I have no counterpart in rail service.","start":1231.993,"stop":1239.827,"duration":7.83},{"text":"In (Inaudible) an official territory which is cited in our brief, original brief at page 26, the Commission said that motor transport unlike rail transport is individualized expedited and more flexible than rail transportation.","start":1239.827,"stop":1254.568,"duration":14.74},{"text":"Now if the motor carriers have

evident in the Natural Gas Act; the Natural Gas Act as it first was enacted was held by the Federal Power Commission to prevent railroads and coal and labor interest from objecting to the extension of natural gas lines.","start":39.61,"stop":56.868,"duration":17.26},{"text":"But as the legislative history shows, that we set out in our brief, Congress amended the act for the very purpose of permitting coal, labor and railroad interest to come before the Federal Power Commission and object to the extension of natural gas lines, and how did Congress bring that about?","start":56.868,"stop":74.928,"duration":18.06},{"text":"Congress brought that about by incorporating in the Natural Gas Act the language of 207 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, the very act we have under consideration here.","start":74.928,"stop":87.687,"duration":12.76},{"text":"And the same committee of Congress that brought about that result and intentionally so as the legislative history shows, I haven't time to read it here.","start":87.687,"stop":97.804,"duration":10.12},{"text":"The same committee -- the House Committee on Interstate Commerce, the same men within two months of that also approved the Freight Forwarder Act of 1942.","start":97.804,"stop":109.938,"duration":12.13},{"text":"And they provided in that act that the Commission could not deny authority to engage in business as a freight forwarder because another freight forwarder was rendering service in the area.","start":109.938,"stop":127.061,"duration":17.12},{"text":"That proved to allow entering into the freight forwarder business and make it too easy and it didn't protect freight forwarders already in the field.","start":127.061,"stop":136.941,"duration":9.88},{"text":"So in 1957 Congress amended that act by changing those conditions and providing that any one entered -- wishing to enter the business of a freight forwarder must prove consistency with a public interest except that a rail controlled freight forwarder -- the application of a rail controlled freight forwarder could not be denied on the ground that there was another freight forwarder operating in the area.","start":136.941,"stop":169.388,"duration":32.45},{"text":"I have gone over those very hastily.","start":169.388,"stop":172.405,"duration":3.02},{"text":"They are all set out in our brief, but

meant.","start":172.405,"stop":188.821,"duration":16.42},{"text":"Congress says use this term, the term public convenience and necessity in these statutes and has used variance of that phrase over the past 37 years in such a way to demonstrate that the language of 207 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act comprehends that the Interstate Commerce Commission has power to determine that public convenience and necessity does not require motor carrier service in an area where there is adequate railroad service despite the fact that there maybe no other motor carrier service serving the area.","start":188.821,"stop":225.29,"duration":36.47},{"text":"Now that is very clear in that course of legislative history and as I say I think that was made clear back in 1942 in the decision of this Court in Alton Railroad Company against United States.","start":225.29,"stop":237.622,"duration":12.33},{"text":"Now going to this matter of rates, it is -- it would seem perfectly clear that in a certificate proceeding where a motor carrier or any carrier for that matter files application for authority to institute new service that that cannot possibly be the occasion of determining questions of rates.","start":237.622,"stop":272.594,"duration":34.97},{"text":"There is adequate rate machinery provided in the Interstate Commerce

carrier applies for a certificate for a new service between A and B, and the railroads come in and they show that they can furnish better service at cheaper rates between A and B than this motor carrier offers, is that to be an answer in a certificate case?","start":281.668,"stop":306.006,"duration":24.34},{"text":"The Acts of Congress that I've referred to make it very clear that public

better service, but the commission held that he would not and that finding has not been attacked in anyway, shape or form.","start":342.533,"stop":354.908,"duration":12.38},{"text":"One consideration here, this is certainly not a perishable commodity, granite monuments, and the evidence shows that the reason, the rail -- for complaints against slow rail service was that shippers waited as much as 99 days I think in one particular case to accumulate a carload, so as to take advantage of the rail carload rates.","start":354.908,"stop":385.31,"duration":30.4},{"text":"The only -- and the evidence is conclusive on this also.","start":385.31,"stop":392.224,"duration":6.91},{"text":"A few shippers testified that if, on cross examination, that if Schaffer, the applicant, charged a higher rate than the railroads, he wouldn't get their business.","start":392.224,"stop":406.649,"duration":14.43},{"text":"Now – so I – the -- if you just think over a certificate case, and an application for authority or see that it just would be impossible to try out all the questions of rates involved and as I say the conclusive answer I think here is that the applicant didn't even try to make a showing that he would give a better rate.","start":406.649,"stop":432.294,"duration":25.64},{"text":"There was nothing in here at all.","start":432.294,"stop":434.049,"duration":1.75},{"text":"A few shippers

is no evidence of the impact of granting this service upon the railroads.","start":439.612,"stop":453.426,"duration":13.81},{"text":"All of the traffic that is here in controversy upwards of 4 million

case, there was no evidence as to the specific amount of traffic.","start":470.719,"stop":476.912,"duration":6.19},{"text":"There was only evidence of the railroads were serving all the points in question, and that was held in that case to give the railroads to require the economic status of the railroads to be given consideration.","start":476.912,"stop":490.643,"duration":13.73},{"text":"Now
