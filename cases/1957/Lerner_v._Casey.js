Boudin","textObjs":[{"text":"-- decisions of this Court in Slochower, the appellees immediately turned their position before the Appellate Division in a supplemental brief in the court below.","start":0,"stop":16.245,"duration":16.25},{"text":"And thereafter, the Court of Appeals are now here into a complete forgetfulness as to the reason given by them by which they are court-bound for the original discharge, a complete forgetfulness as to the inference that was drawn and they attempted to assimilate this case, therefore, to Garner moving back.","start":16.245,"stop":38.673,"duration":22.43},{"text":"Now, the distinction between Garner and our case may be set forth as follows.","start":38.673,"stop":44.449,"duration":5.78},{"text":"In Garner, there was a precise disclosure statute.","start":44.449,"stop":50.182,"duration":5.73},{"text":"In this case, there is not a disclosure statute precise or otherwise.","start":50.182,"stop":55.492,"duration":5.31},{"text":"In this case, there is an evidentiary statute, that is a statute stating that upon certain kinds of evidence, so-called, which I will discuss in a few minutes, evidence of unreliability, the employee may be discharged and we would take the position here that whatever may be the duty of the employee of a state employer under a statute possibly under a regulation, I don't have to meet that issue, under a statute stating that you must disclose.","start":55.492,"stop":85.99,"duration":30.5},{"text":"Although, we're not saying what consequences might be, either way.","start":85.99,"stop":90.881,"duration":4.89},{"text":"The situation is different where the State is required to prove its case by evidence and that Garner is simply inapplicable.","start":90.881,"stop":98.646,"duration":7.77},{"text":"Now, in the Appellate Division while Garner appears, referred to very frequently and in the Court of Appeals while Garner is also referred to very frequently, actually neither court, being a judicial body, wanted to or was able to get away completely from the precise reason given by the appellees for the discharge, namely, the inference that was drawn from the assertion of the privilege.","start":98.646,"stop":127.905,"duration":29.26},{"text":"And so, said the Appellate Division at page 35 of the record repeated thereafter, “It's true we may not infer that appellant is a member of the Communist Party from the decision of the privilege.","start":127.905,"stop":141.325,"duration":13.42},{"text":"On the other hand,” and I call this Court's attention to the “on the other hand,” “on the other hand, we are required to and should accept this truthful, his statements of answers to the questions propounded might have tended to incriminate him.” In other words, they will not draw the inference, but they will draw the inference.","start":141.325,"stop":159.339,"duration":18.01},{"text":"Otherwise, the sentence has no meaning.","start":159.339,"stop":162.014,"duration":2.68},{"text":"And thereafter, the Appellate Division, the Court of Appeals said at page 63 of the record -- pardon me, it's page -- yes, 63 and 64.","start":162.014,"stop":176.512,"duration":14.5},{"text":"When the employee refuses to tell his employer whether he is a member of the Communist Party, surely he is giving evidence of reasonable grounds for doubt as to whether as Mr. Justice Brennan said in the special term opinion, “He might be a member.","start":176.512,"stop":195.402,"duration":18.89},{"text":"He is giving reasonable grounds for doubt as to his trustworthiness and reliability as a security risk.”","start":195.402,"stop":202.239,"duration":6.84},{"text":"And as we say, it seems to us clear that the opinion in Slochower and indeed the dissenting opinion in the Slochower to the extent that they moved along on the issue do not accept as justifiable, as consistent with due process, the inference of unreliability which all the courts below as well as the appellees drew in the situation.","start":202.239,"stop":221.947,"duration":19.71},{"text":"Now, there is one other reason why this is not Garner, citing the fact that this is not a disclosure situation.","start":221.947,"stop":229.824,"duration":7.88},{"text":"There is a radical difference, as I suggested before in my statement of the facts, between the employer, who, as this Court believe, has a duty, has a right to ask his employees certain questions about his own employees' record and the kind of investigating official that the Commissioner of Investigation of the City of New York is.","start":229.824,"stop":254.398,"duration":24.57},{"text":"There are two points that I am now making.One is, the Commission of Investigation is not the Transit Authority.","start":254.398,"stop":261.295,"duration":6.9},{"text":"He's a part of a different government.","start":261.295,"stop":265.355,"duration":4.06},{"text":"And the second thing is that the Commissioner of Investigation has a broad sweeping power and this would be an extension of Garner.","start":265.355,"stop":274.049,"duration":8.69},{"text":"This would mean giving a -- an investigating official the power to ask the people about other people and ask the details about one's life, because in large part of the waiver doctrine that will be implicit in the witnesses and to ask to himself in answer that he could very reasonably give to his employer without the slightest danger.","start":274.049,"stop":293.297,"duration":19.25},{"text":"Now, what do they say about the Commissioner of Investigation?","start":293.297,"stop":297.654,"duration":4.36},{"text":"In our petition, we have -- we pointed out that the investigation was initiated.","start":297.654,"stop":304.014,"duration":6.36},{"text":"I hope the Court will remember my word initiated at the instructions of the mayor of the City of New York who told the Commissioner of investigation to investigate a number of employees in various agencies.","start":304.014,"stop":316.435,"duration":12.42},{"text":"The City of New York was the lessor, a lessor of a physical property of the Transit Authority and it is because the city was a lessor that they argued below that the city had a right to have its Commissioner call the employees of the Transit Authority and we disputed that and we lost in the court below.","start":316.435,"stop":338.458,"duration":22.02},{"text":"What we did we lost in the court below on a ground that we cannot argue here, namely that the City Charter gives the Commissioner certain jurisdiction to investigate virtually anything he wants to in -- under the -- under the standard of the best interests of the city.","start":338.458,"stop":354.962,"duration":16.5},{"text":"But the fact that he has power of the City Charter to investigate an employee of the Transit Authority or a person who was not employed by any agency of Government at all does not make him the employer.","start":354.962,"stop":368.724,"duration":13.76},{"text":"He is still not the employer of appellant and this was recognized.","start":368.724,"stop":374.261,"duration":5.54},{"text":"Again, it's -- it's the second thing that the appellees have forgotten since the original argument in the State Supreme Court.","start":374.261,"stop":381.62,"duration":7.36},{"text":"This was recognized in the State Supreme Court by the appellees and by Mr. Justice Brennan with special terms, because the appellees pointed out in the State Supreme Court that this had been initiated by the Commissioner of investigation and they said there's no reason why the Commission of Investigation can't make available to the Transit Authority anything in his possession and that the Transit Authority cannot use whatever the Commissioner gives it, in the same way that it could use evidence coming from a congressional committee.","start":381.62,"stop":418.796,"duration":37.18},{"text":"And I refer Your Honors to page 8 of my reply brief where this quotation is set forth.","start":418.796,"stop":426.563,"duration":7.77},{"text":"It is submitted and I'll only read the first line that under the Security Risk Law, the authority may consider and weigh evidence from any source whether it be from the Commission of Investigation, the police department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation or evidence of testimony before any legislative or congressional committee.","start":426.563,"stop":447.184,"duration":20.62},{"text":"Now, it may be that they can consider anything they get, what all this proves is, at the Commission of Investigation was treated by the Transit Authority, not as their agents authorized by the Transit Authority to act as an employer or the place of the employer, but as a source of information which anybody including a grand jury or congressional committee might have made available to the -- to the Transit Authority.","start":447.184,"stop":470.735,"duration":23.55}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Are you

reliability.","start":811.208,"stop":817.463,"duration":6.25},{"text":"And may I come down to one more point but I will, of course, proceed further on this if I'm asked and that is that there was a dual reason for the discharge.","start":817.463,"stop":828.126,"duration":10.66},{"text":"Your Honors may recall my stating that the original letter of suspension merely referred to the invocation of the Fifth Amendment.","start":828.126,"stop":836.716,"duration":8.59},{"text":"But the discharge letter referred to other activities and there was never a hearing on those other activities.","start":836.716,"stop":843.654,"duration":6.94},{"text":"There was never an elucidation about those -- other activities were.","start":843.654,"stop":847.327,"duration":3.67},{"text":"And so, we say that is a denial of due process.","start":847.327,"stop":851.367,"duration":4.04},{"text":"Now, let me, because I would not want to, even in the short time, I'm leading for my main argument, avoid the constitutional -- the jurisdictional issue.","start":851.367,"stop":860.471,"duration":9.1},{"text":"The jurisdictional issue was raised by appellees unless they developed it further, in which case I can respond to what seems to be this.","start":860.471,"stop":867.298,"duration":6.83},{"text":"That the appellant should have gone to the Civil Service Commission on an appeal, rather to have gone into the State Supreme Court for review of the Transit Authority's action.","start":867.298,"stop":877.756,"duration":10.46},{"text":"This is really an argument of the non-exhaustion of the administrative remedies.","start":877.756,"stop":881.516,"duration":3.76},{"text":"Now, there are a number of answers such as for example the appellees' acquiescence in the courts below on this particular way of testing the constitutional problems involved and the fact of the statute that we're dealing with here provides that when we go to the Commission, if we do, not to say what happens when we don't.","start":881.516,"stop":899.494,"duration":17.98},{"text":"We can never appeal to the courts, so said the statute.","start":899.494,"stop":901.82,"duration":2.33},{"text":"We have the right to take the statute as its worth, but there is a real and finally there's a principle in New York Administrative Law which I cited in one of my earlier briefs, brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss the appeal, that you have a choice normally of going either to the highest administrative body in the State or going into the courts.","start":901.82,"stop":923.363,"duration":21.54},{"text":"If you go into the courts, you have a greater power of review than if you go to the highest administrative body.","start":923.363,"stop":928.459,"duration":5.1},{"text":"But the real answer, the answer that I might have given at the beginning of this discussion is this.","start":928.459,"stop":933.427,"duration":4.97},{"text":"We raised all the federal constitutional issues in the lower courts including the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals and the other courts decided those issues.","start":933.427,"stop":943.197,"duration":9.77},{"text":"The question that this Court has said so often of whether or not federal issues are raised as a matter normally of federal -- of state court procedure and the state court was perfectly satisfied as were the appellees up to recently to have the issues decided by it.","start":943.197,"stop":960.23,"duration":17.03},{"text":"Now, I want to turn in possibly two minutes of my final discussion to the other points that I made in the brief, because while I think that the issue can be determined by the Slochower and Konigsberg principles, now, I may say, if I must Mr. Justice Harlan, by Footnote 9 even though, Your Honor, is not concluded that's one of the position to the Konigsberg decision.","start":960.23,"stop":986.079,"duration":25.85},{"text":"I want to point out in point (4) of our brief, we take the position that the State cannot decide that an employee can be discharged for membership in an organization even if it'd be the Communist Party, in the absence of some kind of emergency situation which we justify such drastic action.","start":986.079,"stop":1007.411,"duration":21.33},{"text":"And that in 1954, we submit, there was no emergency which would justify the discharge of an employee of the State of New York, subway conductor, a humble man, opening and closing doors or not and as if even if he had joined the Communist Party, even if he was then a member of the Communist Party, and is certainly with no emergency, which call for the discharge of a man for stating the constitutional privilege.","start":1007.411,"stop":1032.147,"duration":24.74},{"text":"Now, it may be asked whether we ever reach this point and the reason why it is conceivable we reach it, if I fail to prevail on the other points, is that we were discharged not for nondisclosure as in Garner, but discharged because there was evidence of unreliability.","start":1032.147,"stop":1049.191,"duration":17.04},{"text":"And we may just as well take the maximum of the evidence and say, “The inferences were drawn that he was or might have been a member of the Communist Party.","start":1049.191,"stop":1057.592,"duration":8.4},{"text":"So, if Your Honors disagree with me on the earlier points which I have made, we may be faced with the question a kind of discharge for inferred membership in the Communist Party be valid if the employee is a subway conductor in the City of New York, not the Federal Government waging the war, if the year is 1954 and if his duties are the duties which have been described incontrovertible in the petition.","start":1057.592,"stop":1082.97,"duration":25.38},{"text":"They add a few more duties in their appendix to their brief which Your Honors, I don't think, can consider as part of this record, namely, that the subway conductor might go on the tracks because he has a badge.","start":1082.97,"stop":1094.175,"duration":11.2},{"text":"Well, I submit that without a badge, the millions of passengers who travel on the New York subway system can do exactly the same kind of theoretical damage that is suggested here and can go on tracks and go into washrooms and control the same number of bonds as a subway conductor can possibly do.","start":1094.175,"stop":1111.762,"duration":17.59},{"text":"Subway conductor, who I may say, from this complaint, have the presumption of -- of good conduct above the average train passenger because of his record as a loyal employee for 21 years, I did not indicate anything further on that point.","start":1111.762,"stop":1128.575,"duration":16.81},{"text":"I will withhold if I may be
