the recovery of corporate income taxes.","start":80.919,"stop":86.835,"duration":5.92},{"text":"The petitioner here is a motor carrier of freight and it holds a license from the Interstate Commerce Commission and operates pursuant to certificates issued by the Commission.","start":86.835,"stop":99.986,"duration":13.15},{"text":"In the industry, it's referred to as a draft freight or general commodity carrier, that is that it carries in -- in all commodities tendered to it by the public with a few exceptions such as articles and book and things of that nature.","start":99.986,"stop":116.344,"duration":16.36},{"text":"The years involved or for the years 1951, 1952 and 1953, the question here insofar as this case is concerned is strictly a legal question and it was not necessary to bring to this Court or to the Court of Appeals any of the record below except the technical record.","start":116.344,"stop":138.418,"duration":22.07},{"text":"In 1942, the Commission of Internal Revenue promulgated a regulation or an interpretation.","start":138.418,"stop":145.081,"duration":6.66},{"text":"The effect of which was to permit a motor carrier to deduct under Section 23 (a) of the Revenue Act sums that it was required to pay to various States because its vehicles had in some way violated the weight limitation laws of the States.","start":145.081,"stop":165.007,"duration":19.93},{"text":"That ruling was -- remained in effect until December 1, 1950.","start":165.007,"stop":172.101,"duration":7.09},{"text":"At that time, the Commissioner, and I might say a new or different Commissioner of Internal Revenue, reversed the earlier ruling and held that such sums were not deductible as ordinary and necessary expenses under Section 23 (a) of the -- the Revenue Act.","start":172.101,"stop":190.743,"duration":18.64},{"text":"As a result of that latter interpretation, the agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue audited the tax returns for the petitioner, Hoover, for the years 1951, 1952 and 1953.","start":190.743,"stop":205.201,"duration":14.46},{"text":"And insofar as we are here concerned, the only change was that certain sums paid by the petitioner as fines under the various statutes of the various States through which it operated, were disallowed as an operating expense, an additional tax was assessed against petitioner by reason of the disallowance of these items which had been claimed as expenses.","start":205.201,"stop":233.389,"duration":28.19},{"text":"The petitioner paid the additional tax, filed a claim for refund which as you know is a prerequisite to a suit for recovery.","start":233.389,"stop":241.189,"duration":7.8},{"text":"When the claim for refund was denied, a suit for recovery was filed in the District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.","start":241.189,"stop":248.343,"duration":7.15},{"text":"The case was there tried, evidence was introduced and the Court decided the case adversely to the contentions of petitioner.","start":248.343,"stop":256.163,"duration":7.82},{"text":"And in doing so, it made it unnecessary to transcribe the testimony in the case.","start":256.163,"stop":262.947,"duration":6.78},{"text":"The petitioner, as a matter of fact, offered substantial evidence that -- to the effect that its violations or the fines resulted not from any willful act on its part or not from any negligent act but in spite of all reasonable care that it could take.","start":262.947,"stop":282.284,"duration":19.34},{"text":"Now, the court below, in deciding the case, predicated its decision upon the assumption that the petitioner did not act willfully in anyway in overloading any truck nor it was -- did it fail to take all reasonable precautions consistent with a practical operation of its business.","start":282.284,"stop":304.127,"duration":21.84},{"text":"Did in spite of those -- of that assumption, the District Court held that to allow the deduction would frustrate the enforcement of state -- state weight acts and therefore were not deductible.","start":304.127,"stop":319.271,"duration":15.14},{"text":"Now, this Court has never expressly held that, if I may refer to it as a frustration theory, was or was not valid.","start":319.271,"stop":331.079,"duration":11.81},{"text":"This Court has had two cases in which it is discussed and the first one was referred to as the Heininger case and Judge Learned Hand of the Second Circuit in the Rossman case, construed that case as we contend it should be construed.","start":331.079,"stop":348.977,"duration":17.9},{"text":"Later, this Court, in the case of -- in the Lilly case in passing on that question, expressly limited the effect of that decision insofar as the Commissioner here attempting to invoke it.","start":348.977,"stop":369.105,"duration":20.13},{"text":"I won't read that now but it states in substance that assuming for the purpose of argument that there may be a situation where an expense is ordinary and necessary and still it would not be allowed as a deduction because it would frustrate some sharply defined public power that the facts in the Lilly case did not -- were not in that category.","start":369.105,"stop":391.651,"duration":22.55},{"text":"Now, it is our position here, one, that the Revenue Act is a revenue producing statute and it is not a policing statute.","start":391.651,"stop":400.313,"duration":8.66},{"text":"Congress never intended for the Revenue Act to be used as a supplement to enforce all of the laws of all of the States.","start":400.313,"stop":409.17,"duration":8.86},{"text":"Second, even if the frustration theory as -- has been referred to by this Court on two occasions is sound which we deny that even that would not permit or would not forbid the deductions in this case.","start":409.17,"stop":427.535,"duration":18.37},{"text":"Now, the District Court and the Court of Appeals, which affirmed him in a very short per curiam opinion and adopted the decision of the Court of Appeals, they did not hold that these expenses were not ordinary and necessary.","start":427.535,"stop":443.232,"duration":15.7},{"text":"They did not -- they based the decision solely on the fact that even if they are ordinary and necessary, and to allow them would frustrate the enforcement of the state statute.","start":443.232,"stop":454.528,"duration":11.3},{"text":"Now, it is our position that that is an erroneous legal conclusion.","start":454.528,"stop":460.678,"duration":6.15},{"text":"If a carrier has done what the District Court assumed that it did, that is that it took all reasonable precautions to comply with all of the state weight limitation laws.","start":460.678,"stop":473.901,"duration":13.22},{"text":"They could reasonably be expected of it consistent with the practical operation of its business.","start":473.901,"stop":479.348,"duration":5.45},{"text":"If you take that assumption of fact, then the allowance or disallowance of these fines as an expense is going to have absolutely no bearing on future violations or future compliance.","start":479.348,"stop":491.719,"duration":12.37},{"text":"If it has no bearing on future violations or future compliance, then it cannot frustrate the enforcement of that act.","start":491.719,"stop":499.418,"duration":7.7},{"text":"So it is our position that even if this Court should find that ordinary and necessary expenses are not deductible if they would -- if the allowance would tend to frustrate the sharply defined policies or public policies of the State that even in -- that would not preclude the recovery under the factual situation under which we're trying this case.","start":499.418,"stop":525.823,"duration":26.4}]},{"speakerName":"Harold Burton","textObjs":[{"text":"But if they deductible, doesn't that in effect reduce the burden upon the -- the effect stated (Voice Overlap) --","start":525.823,"stop":531.103,"duration":5.28}]},{"speakerName":"Judson Harwood","textObjs":[{"text":"That is the theory on which some of the lower courts have denied.","start":531.103,"stop":536.021,"duration":4.92},{"text":"Now, if the Court please, the case that I think best analyzes the entire situation is the case of Rossman Corporation versus Commissioner 175 F.2d.","start":536.021,"stop":548.845,"duration":12.82},{"text":"That decision was written by Judge Learned Hand and it did involve a penalty under the OPA statute.","start":548.845,"stop":557.665,"duration":8.82},{"text":"Now, I have quoted at length at pages 6, 7 and 8 of our brief the -- that opinion.","start":557.665,"stop":566.375,"duration":8.71},{"text":"Judge Hand in substance says, “There are penalties and penalty.","start":566.375,"stop":569.976,"duration":3.6},{"text":"Some are deductible and some are not.”","start":569.976,"stop":572.429,"duration":2.45},{"text":"That's the way he construes this Court's decision in the Heininger case.","start":572.429,"stop":577.12,"duration":4.69},{"text":"And he also recognizes the distinction between an unlawful activity which has resulted in an expenditure that was willful or negligent and one that was non-willful or non-negligent.","start":577.12,"stop":592.276,"duration":15.16},{"text":"He states on the other hand, “Lack of proper care would be relevant to whether the allowance would frustrate the act.”","start":592.276,"stop":600.896,"duration":8.62},{"text":"Now, the Commissioner in the lower courts and in his brief here has made substantial argument out of the fact that the OPA statute, by its very terms, drew a distinction between a willful violation and a non-willful.","start":600.896,"stop":619.622,"duration":18.73},{"text":"Well, if the Court please, that is true but the distinction only went to the degree of the punishment.","start":619.622,"stop":625.96,"duration":6.34},{"text":"If you were willfully violating that act, you paid one thing.","start":625.96,"stop":629.521,"duration":3.56},{"text":"If you -- if the administrator found that your violation was not willful, you paid another thing.","start":629.521,"stop":634.749,"duration":5.23},{"text":"You paid a smaller amount.","start":634.749,"stop":636.573,"duration":1.82}]},{"speakerName":"Harold Burton","textObjs":[{"text":"But if you'll interpret the acts of Congress as making these deductibles, you can say not only did Congress to that extent reduced the burden on the taxpayer but it assumed it by the Federal

some 200 trucks, five or six nights a week.","start":650.254,"stop":662.32,"duration":12.07},{"text":"The District Court found as a fact in this case, not the assumption that the vast majority of the

fine.","start":662.32,"stop":680.8,"duration":18.48},{"text":"But during the transit, that load in these large tractor-trailers can shift just a few inches one way or the other, and by reason of that
