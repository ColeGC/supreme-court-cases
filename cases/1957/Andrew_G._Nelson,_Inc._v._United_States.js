209 (a) of the statute establishes this very clearly.","start":422.088,"stop":428.83,"duration":6.74},{"text":"Once the Commission performs the only administrative function assigned to it in case of a

proceedings.\"","start":436.217,"stop":463.55,"duration":27.33},{"text":"The second point of law was established by this Court's decision in the Seatrain

Act.","start":499.544,"stop":512.049,"duration":12.5},{"text":"In this case, the Commission has sought to avoid the violation of your decision in the Seatrain case by stating, “We have done nothing to

what the rights secure your head from the beginning.","start":526.782,"stop":534.322,"duration":7.54},{"text":"We have seen that the rights which the carrier had from the beginning were rights given

without looking at one of two things or both.","start":548.893,"stop":556.768,"duration":7.88},{"text":"You must look back in this case to 1938 and see what the Commission found as an administrative finding was the scope for the grandfather business.","start":556.768,"stop":568.1,"duration":11.33},{"text":"And perhaps you may also look to 1935 to evidence establishing what the scope of the grandfather business was.","start":568.1,"stop":577.383,"duration":9.28},{"text":"We have here a decision which holds that they have only established what rights we had from the beginning but openly stating that they have made that determination refusing to look at any fact that occurred prior to 1942, the date, the permit issue.","start":577.383,"stop":596.13,"duration":18.75},{"text":"In other words, the convict -- the Commission convicts itself of having interpreted here a grandfather right stating it's deliberate ignorance and disregard of those facts which the statute makes controlling of a grandfather right.","start":596.13,"stop":618.038,"duration":21.91},{"text":"We think that this decision of the Commission can be established as equally erroneous even if we disregard and then we'd have to treat it as an ordinary permit having no basis on grandfather rights.","start":618.038,"stop":631.167,"duration":13.13},{"text":"To establish this, we will have to explain a little bit the general theory of restriction as it's reflected in the Commission's decision.","start":631.167,"stop":640.232,"duration":9.06},{"text":"Early on in the administration of the Act, this manner of restriction, speaking now of restriction and permits yet to be issued came up -- came before the Commission.","start":640.232,"stop":653.207,"duration":12.98},{"text":"The first important case was the Keystone case, taking a name of one of the carrier applicants in which the Commission had before it some 80 odd applicants seeking to serve Atlantic and Pacific Tea stores.","start":653.207,"stop":668.191,"duration":14.98},{"text":"Many of those applicants' applications were based upon grandfather service of those stores.","start":668.191,"stop":674.206,"duration":6.01},{"text":"The Commission's decision in that case and particular to the special concurring opinion of that brilliant Commissioner, Joseph B. Eastman states clearly the concern which the Commission felt of the need for strictly limiting these grandfather carriers so that every possible restriction reflected by the evidence before them should be reflected in the right which they got.","start":674.206,"stop":703.091,"duration":28.88},{"text":"They discovered that these carriers who were hauling this material for A&P, in the grandfather period had served nobody but the A&P stores.","start":703.091,"stop":713.775,"duration":10.68},{"text":"So there emerged from that decision what is called yet today the Keystone restriction.","start":713.775,"stop":719.631,"duration":5.86},{"text":"The Commission pointed out that if you take all the commodities in the A&P stores and simply authorized these carriers to haul all of those commodities, you would in effect give them a general authority to haul almost every type of merchandise that move for anybody.","start":719.631,"stop":736.579,"duration":16.95},{"text":"Therefore and based upon the detection of these fact that the grandfather service had been limited to this type of customer, they granted the authority to haul all of those commodities but added language subsequently as follows, but only under contracts with those operating retail food stores.","start":736.579,"stop":757.874,"duration":21.3},{"text":"That is a Keystone restriction.","start":757.874,"stop":762.916,"duration":5.04},{"text":"That establishes the Commission's policy restriction.","start":762.916,"stop":766.411,"duration":3.49},{"text":"Now, we must tie that up with their declaration in the Atlantic Freight Lines case, in which they said in another case where restriction by implication was sought, whenever it has been our intention to place a limitation upon authorized operation, we have done so specifically and have not left our intent to be implied.","start":766.411,"stop":792.963,"duration":26.55},{"text":"One of these Keystone cases involved a carrier named McAteer, Simon McAteer.","start":792.963,"stop":800.868,"duration":7.91},{"text":"In a reconsideration of the whole case, his application became the titled case.","start":800.868,"stop":807.162,"duration":6.29},{"text":"His first compliance order describing his grandfather rights was issued the same date as was ours, February 14th, 1935.","start":807.162,"stop":817.893,"duration":10.73},{"text":"His case went to further hearings.","start":817.893,"stop":821.394,"duration":3.5},{"text":"In the further hearings, the Commission described what McAteer's grandfather business had been as the transportation of stock in trade of A&P stores.","start":821.394,"stop":835.683,"duration":14.29},{"text":"This authority which issued the finding of fact was that he had been handing -- handling goods such as are handled by A&P stores.","start":835.683,"stop":847.421,"duration":11.74},{"text":"Thus, the Commission at that time, the very time for it was issuing regarded both those terms as synonymous and each is falling in the classification of description of a commodity by reference to place of sale.","start":847.421,"stop":870.136,"duration":22.71},{"text":"Following this famous case, establishing -- when this Court approved it in the Noble case, the right of the Commission to insert such a restriction, the Commission apparently then turned its eye towards the restrictions that had -- that they permitted and issued before that time and to the possibility of restricting those permits to reflect the authority they had merely acquired.","start":870.136,"stop":903.85,"duration":33.71},{"text":"To understand the program which followed, it's necessary to understand briefly the mechanics of commodity description of contracting common carriers.","start":903.85,"stop":916.706,"duration":12.86},{"text":"There were several devices used to -- in commodity description to restrict the commodities to those in a certain class.","start":916.706,"stop":924.822,"duration":8.12},{"text":"First, there was the device described by the Commission, a description by reference to place of sale.","start":924.822,"stop":931.158,"duration":6.34},{"text":"Next, there was a description by reference to the industry served.","start":931.158,"stop":937.419,"duration":6.26},{"text":"There was another one by reference to the type of commodity -- type of vehicle required to transport the commodity.","start":937.419,"stop":945.089,"duration":7.67},{"text":"As illustrative of the first, we have the Keystone case and this commodity such as are sold in a certain time of this -- this type of establishment.","start":945.089,"stop":955.243,"duration":10.15},{"text":"As the illustration of the second, we have the Dart case, packing house product supplies, primary supplies, supplies of a particular industry.","start":955.243,"stop":967.557,"duration":12.31},{"text":"Then we have the -- the description, petroleum products such as must be moved in tank trucks.","start":967.557,"stop":976.434,"duration":8.88},{"text":"The first attempt to whittle down a commodity description in which place of sale was the basis, was made about 1945 or 1946, the case was decided in 1947.","start":976.434,"stop":991.415,"duration":14.98},{"text":"When the Commission attacked the Chicago carrier who had authority to transport commodities such as are sold by wholesale food houses, I may not have that verbatim, but that was the substance of it.","start":991.415,"stop":1010.724,"duration":19.31},{"text":"The contention made by the Commission there was exactly the contention here.","start":1010.724,"stop":1015.863,"duration":5.14},{"text":"This means commodity sold by wholesale food houses but only when moved to wholesale food houses.","start":1015.863,"stop":1023.349,"duration":7.49},{"text":"The Commission -- the Court found, refused to read that restriction and the permit when it were -- it was not stated and said that
