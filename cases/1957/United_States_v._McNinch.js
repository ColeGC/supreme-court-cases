to reach any person without regard to whether that person had direct contractual relations with the Government, and that is also true here.","start":456.092,"stop":477.636,"duration":21.54},{"text":"The Court also held that the test of application of the Act was whether, ultimately and eventually, there might result payment of government money.","start":477.636,"stop":489.231,"duration":11.59},{"text":"I might say that in that case, that was a case where fraudulent claims were asserted by contractors against a municipality

improvement.","start":507.971,"stop":518.626,"duration":10.65},{"text":"And so, though the false claims were presented to the municipality, the loss was ultimately born by the Treasury of the United

Biggs dissenting in the opinion in the Cochran case of the Fifth Circuit with Judge Reed dissenting, holding that such fraudulent applications did not constitute claims against the Government within the meaning of the False Claims Act.","start":534.322,"stop":570.225,"duration":35.9},{"text":"Now, the -- these circuits strictly interpreted the word “claim” in the False Claims Act as a demand for money or property as a right, and since no demands were made for the payment of the loans, the Act did not cover the transaction.","start":570.225,"stop":586.568,"duration":16.34},{"text":"And the opinion suggests that if there had been an actual default on the loans, and if there had been an actual payment by FHA, then the Act would apply.","start":586.568,"stop":598.572,"duration":12},{"text":"But here, these applications were made upon FHA titled loan credit forms, here the defendants made the fraudulent applications with the objective and intent in understanding that they would be reported to and accepted by FHA for guarantees.","start":598.572,"stop":616.866,"duration":18.29},{"text":"Here, they knew the bank wouldn't have made these loans except for the Government's guarantee.","start":616.866,"stop":622.877,"duration":6.01},{"text":"Now, what was the essence of this transaction?","start":622.877,"stop":628.328,"duration":5.45},{"text":"Upon FHA approval of this bank, which happened before these applications were filed, and upon the filing of these applications on these FHA forms, with the representations made in -- in them, that brought them within the scope of the Act and entitled them to the loan, and entitle the bank to the guarantee of the Government.","start":628.328,"stop":656.094,"duration":27.77},{"text":"And when the bank made that guarantee, it became unqualifiedly committed as the guarantor of any future losses.","start":656.094,"stop":664.519,"duration":8.42},{"text":"So, we say that these applications were in reality and practically in -- in substance directed against the assets of the United States.","start":664.519,"stop":674.448,"duration":9.93},{"text":"And it's our position that the word “claim” under the statute goes beyond a simple demand for the immediate payment of money.","start":674.448,"stop":685.084,"duration":10.64},{"text":"Here, the claim, the fraudulent claim was to the pledge of the credit of the United States and it was that guarantee which we made, and we say that guarantee was a property.","start":685.084,"stop":705.692,"duration":20.61},{"text":"Now, you'll notice this no restrictive language in the statute as to the word “claim”.","start":705.692,"stop":709.967,"duration":4.27},{"text":"It says, any claim, which would ordinarily mean all claims.","start":709.967,"stop":714.276,"duration":4.31},{"text":"It refers not merely to payment, but payment or approval of a fraudulent claim.","start":714.276,"stop":721.294,"duration":7.02},{"text":"Now, the Third Circuit and the Fifth Circuit interpret this statute as directed the claims for money or property.","start":721.294,"stop":731.251,"duration":9.96},{"text":"We don't object to that.","start":731.251,"stop":733.389,"duration":2.14},{"text":"And -- and I think that's undoubtedly so, but we say the word “property” shouldn't have been restricted by those circuits to tangible property, that, of course, it covers property in its ordinary sense, tangibles

this case we -- we submit is this, is a contract of guarantee -- is a pledge to the credit of the United States property, if so, this was a claim for property under the Civil False Claims Act.","start":766.566,"stop":787.397,"duration":20.83},{"text":"Now, we say property should be deemed to include a franchise, a patent, a copyright, a contract of insurance, a contract of guarantee, a contract of indemnity, any that shows an action of any legal right.","start":787.397,"stop":803.732,"duration":16.33},{"text":"I might remind you of what this Court said in the Arenz case in 290 U.S. 66, which I don't think is on our brief, in construing the word “property” in a statute.","start":803.732,"stop":815.522,"duration":11.79},{"text":"We said -- it's Fidelity and Deposit Company against Arenz, 290 U.S. 66.","start":815.522,"stop":823.751,"duration":8.23},{"text":"And this is a way you construe the word “property” in a federal statute.","start":823.751,"stop":829.131,"duration":5.38},{"text":"Property is a word of very broad meaning and when used without qualification, expressly made or plainly implied, it reasonably may be construe to include obligations, rights and other intangibles as well as physical things.","start":829.131,"stop":847.003,"duration":17.87},{"text":"And then in Lynch against United States in 292 U.S., and an opinion by Justice Brandeis who held at War Risk Insurance policies being contracts for property and created vested rights.","start":847.003,"stop":861.872,"duration":14.87},{"text":"And so, we say here, that FHA applications, fraudulent ones, that these defendants for a loan guaranteed by FHA were a claim for a contract of indemnity.","start":861.872,"stop":879.369,"duration":17.5},{"text":"Now, the -- the Third Circuit and the Fifth Court and the Fourth Circuit has made -- made another false distinction, we believe.","start":879.369,"stop":892.601,"duration":13.23},{"text":"They say that the test of liability is whether that's what's involved on the loan, which suggest that the Government, after

defrauders an opportunity to buy the notes in case of a default to prevent a call upon the guarantee.","start":892.601,"stop":927.296,"duration":34.7},{"text":"Of course, it would be practically an
