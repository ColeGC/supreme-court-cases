distinctions that this Court has supported completely in such cases as Bell against United States and Prince against United States and the C.I.T.

punishment for a single criminal act then we resolve the doubts in favor of the criminal defendant.","start":1132.828,"stop":1193.092,"duration":60.26},{"text":"Now, we have examined in our brief the

more helpful legislative history but the rule stated in both Prince and Bell is that unless the legislative history, as I read those cases, unless the legislative history shows an intention to impose

really covered by the words “the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon” that the two statutes Section 250 -- no that we can and therefore infer that it was understood by Congress in adopting the Criminal Code of 1909, but the statute meant what it originally said that it's the use of the weapon or the discharge of the weapon that was condemned, that the consequences were not material and you didn't look to them and this statute being combined with 254, the two of them should be construed in the same way and therefore, 254 means just what 118 meant, and the offense is simply the use of the dangerous weapon without regard to the consequences.","start":1536.464,"stop":1610.74,"duration":74.28},{"text":"I've been discouraged by the statements of this Court in the Prince case and in the
