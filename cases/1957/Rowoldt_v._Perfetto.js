the experience of the legislative history or previous decisions of courts, no precise definition was available.","start":413.119,"stop":423.303,"duration":10.18},{"text":"It referred essentially to the legislative history of a provision which was enacted in 1951 at which time Congress passed in clarifying of -- the clarifying act as to the meaning of member as used in the Act of 1950.","start":423.303,"stop":452.416,"duration":29.11},{"text":"Galvan established at least these propositions clearly.","start":452.416,"stop":459.078,"duration":6.66},{"text":"One, it is not necessary to fall within the orbit of the 1950 Act that the alien have knowledge of the Communist Party's alleged advocacy of violence.","start":459.078,"stop":474.4,"duration":15.32},{"text":"It is necessary however that he has some awareness of the platform and purposes of the Party.","start":474.4,"stop":481.666,"duration":7.27},{"text":"He must be aware that the organization he has joined is known as the Communist Party which operates as a distinct and active political organization, and his relationship with the organization must be of a character that you could characterize it as more than nominal.","start":481.666,"stop":502.14,"duration":20.47},{"text":"The guide post was the legislative debate, and the only guide post referred to in Galvan was the legislative debate in 1951 revolving around the clarifying provision with regards to the meaning of the term member.","start":502.14,"stop":518.51,"duration":16.37},{"text":"That Act was introduced, at least that clarifying amendment was introduced by Congress because of devoid of the original office of the Internal Security Act to Senator McCarran and Congressman Walter.","start":518.51,"stop":530.696,"duration":12.19},{"text":"But the Attorney General had been applying the term member wrongfully as applying to every kind of member.","start":530.696,"stop":538.308,"duration":7.61},{"text":"And they felt that not only do they not issue to be so applied but they stated in the cross of the debate that had never been to their attention, that it -- that it should be so applied.","start":538.308,"stop":551.261,"duration":12.95},{"text":"The clarifying amendment expressly provided that the statute will not cover those who had joined the Communist Party when they were children or they became members by operation of law or to obtain the necessities of life.","start":551.261,"stop":567.94,"duration":16.68},{"text":"This Court's opinion recognized however, that these three categories of nominal membership were not the sole categories of nominal membership intended by Congress and that there could be other instances of nominal membership.","start":567.94,"stop":584.723,"duration":16.78},{"text":"The Government recognized it isn't well in its brief and it recognizes the force of Galvan in creating the caveat as to the nature of membership.","start":584.723,"stop":597.351,"duration":12.63},{"text":"It suggests, that is the base to point out, the meaning of that caveat to refer more fully to the Senate debate.","start":597.351,"stop":606.239,"duration":8.89},{"text":"We agree with him in that, but we think here, we will find that the debate is somewhat confusing.","start":606.239,"stop":613.903,"duration":7.66},{"text":"It is not in itself too clear a guide because different Senators said not really different things but somewhat vague things.","start":613.903,"stop":623.146,"duration":9.24},{"text":"We suggest and we believe properly so that the language are set forth on page 25 of the Government's brief and the quotation from Senator Ferguson is as good a guide as there might be to what Congress had in mind.","start":623.146,"stop":639.026,"duration":15.88},{"text":"Senator Ferguson incidentally was one of the Senators who introduced an amendment to this clarifying amendment.","start":639.026,"stop":646.479,"duration":7.45},{"text":"The amendment originally introduced by Senator McCarran, were not have applied to

all those who were Communist by conviction, what we might call mentally communist.","start":675.854,"stop":684.115,"duration":8.26},{"text":"But it would not exclude those who really in effect never have been what I call mentally communist.","start":684.115,"stop":691.516,"duration":7.4},{"text":"Those who's Communist affiliation was nominal or involuntarily.","start":691.516,"stop":697.025,"duration":5.51},{"text":"“Thus clearly, so far as Senator Ferguson was concerned, the attachment to the Communist Party must be something more than just

beliefs.","start":705.03,"stop":712.315,"duration":7.29},{"text":"The same language as appears also at the same volume of the Congressional Record at page 2387.","start":712.315,"stop":721.024,"duration":8.71},{"text":"Again what Senator Ferguson said, “When we change the statute here today, we are not changing it as to people who were Fascists, Nazis,

those persons who never walk mentally or psychologically, Fascists, Nazis, Communists, or totalitarians, or any stripe, or any color.“","start":740.272,"stop":754.877,"duration":14.6},{"text":"Similarly, Congressman Walter, who was the author of the clarifying provision on the House side speaking at 97 Congressional Record 2674 and this does not appear in any of the briefs, said that under the present wording, that is the wording of this qualifying amendment -- under the present wording of the bill, active and voluntary

original meaning of the Act.","start":828.519,"stop":833.279,"duration":4.76},{"text":"According to the debate also, and I think as the Government contends and we agree, the purpose that Congress had in mind in indicating this was to say that they wished the term member to have the same meaning in this statute, in the 1950 statute that the term member had had a deportation statutes as a result of
