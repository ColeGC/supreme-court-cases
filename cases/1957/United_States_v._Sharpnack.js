1866.","start":423.01,"stop":426.287,"duration":3.28},{"text":"It did it again in 1898.","start":426.287,"stop":429.962,"duration":3.68},{"text":"And at that point, it recognized -- in those two reenactments it recognized the limitations of the Paul decision.","start":429.962,"stop":437.537,"duration":7.57},{"text":"It provided that what should be a crime on a federal enclave was that which was a crime by the laws of the surrounding State at the time the Act was passed.","start":437.537,"stop":454.007,"duration":16.47},{"text":"And as a matter of fact in 1866 and in 1880 -- 1898 and 1899, it went so far as to say that even the repeal of the state law would not affect the federal crime as such.","start":454.007,"stop":470.831,"duration":16.82},{"text":"From 1933 on, Congress showed increasingly, I think, that -- shall I say increasing strain against the Paul decision.","start":470.831,"stop":484.168,"duration":13.34},{"text":"For one thing in 1933 -- after 1933, there were many more reenactments of the statute, much more frequently.","start":484.168,"stop":497.041,"duration":12.87},{"text":"There was a reenactment in 1933 to bring it up to state laws at that date and then again in 1935 to bring it up to state laws at that date and then in 1940.","start":497.041,"stop":509.026,"duration":11.99},{"text":"And finally, in the 1940 Act revision of the criminal code, the reviser said, we see no reason for this pro forma amendment.","start":509.026,"stop":520.306,"duration":11.28},{"text":"We want to bring in the State the congressional law up to date all the time and therefore they passed the Act in its present form.","start":520.306,"stop":532.449,"duration":12.14},{"text":"Now, in the period from 1933 before 1948, Congress showed its intention that its basic policy was conformity in several other way.","start":532.449,"stop":545.731,"duration":13.28},{"text":"For example, as I've said before, the oldest statutes had provided that even though the state law was repealed, it still remained an offense for federal law.","start":545.731,"stop":562.237,"duration":16.51},{"text":"Congress changed that in 1933 and provided that it was a federal offense at the time of enactment, that was assumed to be necessary at that time but that if by the time the Act was done, the state law had been repealed then it was not to be a federal statute.","start":562.237,"stop":586.041,"duration":23.8},{"text":"And the legislative history of the various enactments show as Congress said in 1940, legislation of this type is passed every few years in order to bring the criminal law in effect on federal reservations as nearly as possible into conformity with the law currently in effect in the State.","start":586.041,"stop":612.114,"duration":26.07},{"text":"1935 revision shows that the only reason Congress kept inserting dates was that they thought they had to.","start":612.114,"stop":622.457,"duration":10.34},{"text":"And Mr. Justice Black, the 193 -- 1933 Amendment which you sponsored, you said as Senator, that while there might be some questions, you have some doubt as to the policy of conformity.","start":622.457,"stop":635.642,"duration":13.19},{"text":"It seems that if we were going to have conformity in order to be up to date and not out of date.","start":635.642,"stop":643.314,"duration":7.67},{"text":"Now, I think that it is the Paul decision with which we have to deal but it seems to me that the history of the statute show that whatever may have been true in 1825 or 1832 at the time of the Paul decision, at the time when the federal government was very jealous of its jurisdiction that as of 1948 and as of now, this isn't realistically -- the statute cannot truly fit as if -- one of the opinion said, as if the laws of each of the 48 States have been set out as in extenso.","start":643.314,"stop":694.518,"duration":51.2},{"text":"That isn't the rationale of the statute.Congress has said so, the language said so, the practicality of the situation shows that what Congress has decided really is that its desirable federal policy to have conformity in this minor matters to state law.","start":694.518,"stop":717.556,"duration":23.04},{"text":"And if that's the federal policy and I guess I'm going to say this a few times, if conformity is an invalid policy then this is the statute which conforMs.","start":717.556,"stop":731.24,"duration":13.68},{"text":"I think it gets those illustrations if we think of it in terms of an important area covered by the statute, traffic regulations.","start":731.24,"stop":739.272,"duration":8.03},{"text":"In 1933, we were enforcing traffic regulations in existence in 1909.","start":739.272,"stop":747.099,"duration":7.83},{"text":"And, I think on that basis, one might well challenge the rationality of the statute whereas enforced, it is obviously sensible for Congress to say, if we have a little area in the middle of a State here, the sensible thing is to have traffic regulations the same as the whole surrounding State.","start":747.099,"stop":769.924,"duration":22.82},{"text":"And I think more basic than that even, the whole justifications of the statute in a sense has to be the policy of conformity.","start":769.924,"stop":780.886,"duration":10.96},{"text":"After all, Congress without some good reason can't say that an Act, reckless driving let's say, is punishable by six months imprisonment in this area and possible year imprisonment maybe five miles away in another state.","start":780.886,"stop":804.676,"duration":23.79},{"text":"Now, what's the reason why this is possible?","start":804.676,"stop":808.287,"duration":3.61},{"text":"This is possible because when you take into consideration the dual nature of our Government, the somewhat anomalous position of federal enclaves in our dual system of government, the primary responsibility of the state in this field of criminal law and particularly the so-called common crime, then it is rational.","start":808.287,"stop":839.895,"duration":31.61},{"text":"And to the extent that the Paul and the subsequent Franklin decision, upheld the validity of the older form of a statute, this Court recognize that it is rational for Congress to say under our system of government, of federal enclave, it makes sense to have the law of a federal enclave conform to the law of the State.","start":839.895,"stop":865.948,"duration":26.05},{"text":"And so, if the statute -- if the whole theory of the Assimilative Crime Act is valid, it must be justified on the grounds that conformity to state law is a valid federal policy.","start":865.948,"stop":881.904,"duration":15.96},{"text":"And I said I was going to say this several times, if conformity is a valid federal policy then true conformity is a valid policy because it is more real conformity to have it up to date than it is to have it five or six or 10 years old.","start":881.904,"stop":904.683,"duration":22.78},{"text":"I think that becomes very clear when -- when Texas cases in relation to two decisions by this Court where it was held that this -- that the federal government could not adopt state laws.","start":904.683,"stop":920.305,"duration":15.62},{"text":"And those were Knickerbocker Ice and Washington against Dawson in 253 and 274 United States where on vigorous dissents by Justice Holmes and Justice Brandeis, this Court held that Congress could not pass state maritime as State Workmen's Compensation laws apply to maritime industries.","start":920.305,"stop":950.806,"duration":30.5},{"text":"But what's interesting about the majority opinions in those cases is that that was put on the ground that maritime law has to be uniform.","start":950.806,"stop":966.056,"duration":15.25},{"text":"And it said we couldn't have maritime law, we had law in one place and one law in another and one in the third.","start":966.056,"stop":972.956,"duration":6.9},{"text":"But this Court has -- the implications of Paul way back in 1832, and the implications of Franklin in 1909 to 16 United States or that when it comes to criminal jurisdiction on federal enclave, it is valid to have non-uniformity.","start":972.956,"stop":991.941,"duration":18.99},{"text":"It is valid to look to the state law and therefore it -- it is valid to look to the state law then it seems also valid to look to the state law as it exist at the time that the act was done.","start":991.941,"stop":1012.536,"duration":20.59},{"text":"Now, in addition to that and thinking now particularly in terms of delegation, it seems to me that the history of the statute indicates why this is not an invalid delegation even if it is treated as such.","start":1012.536,"stop":1031.405,"duration":18.87},{"text":"For one thing, the history of the statute makes clear that one has a right to consider in -- at least in the -- in the question of delegation that this is not carte blanche.","start":1031.405,"stop":1049.823,"duration":18.42},{"text":"Before the Act of 1825 and at all times then, Congress has designed most of the major crimes, most of the offenses that have come up under the Assimilative Crimes Act are minor offenses.","start":1049.823,"stop":1068.223,"duration":18.4},{"text":"There are very some barely serious offenses that are not designed by Congress and they do occasionally arise.","start":1068.223,"stop":1075.003,"duration":6.78},{"text":"But the majority -- but the fact is, however, the Congress has said, we are looking to the state law only in those areas that we do not think important enough to deform so that this is not a sort of delegation to the State saying we have no legislative policy.","start":1075.003,"stop":1095.987,"duration":20.98},{"text":"Congress has a legislative policy.","start":1095.987,"stop":1100.736,"duration":4.75},{"text":"In addition, the courts have held by now and accepted even though it is the lower court's decision that so long as there is any federal policy shown in the field, the Assimilative Crimes Act will not apply.","start":1100.736,"stop":1117.399,"duration":16.66},{"text":"For example, the Civil Aeronautics Board had a regulation prohibiting segregation in airport.","start":1117.399,"stop":1125.913,"duration":8.51},{"text":"It was held that in view of that federal policy expressed by that federal regulation, the State's segregation laws did not apply to airport in Virginia.","start":1125.913,"stop":1140.423,"duration":14.51},{"text":"So that again, we have a limited area in which this operates, Congress isn't just generally adopting all state laws.","start":1140.423,"stop":1150.419,"duration":10},{"text":"It is adopting those which it has not thought in court and to design.","start":1150.419,"stop":1156.264,"duration":5.84},{"text":"It is adopting those as to which Congress has in other fields and administrative agencies have no policy so that this works in the quite limited areas.","start":1156.264,"stop":1169.875,"duration":13.61},{"text":"And thirdly, there is the limitations that adhere from the facts that this is a federal system -- that this is a federal crime declared by Congress.","start":1169.875,"stop":1184.524,"duration":14.65},{"text":"I take it and it seems to be more theoretical that one could conjure up situations where conceivably the State might have a law which would come within the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment with the area that is led to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment that would not be covered by the bill.","start":1184.524,"stop":1208.686,"duration":24.16},{"text":"And I suppose that's where the greatest possible question of delegation of powers that arise.","start":1208.686,"stop":1218.22,"duration":9.53},{"text":"But this is more -- this is not fair.","start":1218.22,"stop":1220.845,"duration":2.63},{"text":"Actually, this is a -- when one examines this, this possibility cannot arise because these crimes under the Assimilative Crimes Act are federal crimes to be prosecuted by federal prosecutors in federal court.","start":1220.845,"stop":1236.519,"duration":15.67},{"text":"And therefore, if one does conceive as an area which might be valid to the State under the Fourteenth Amendment, it could not so long as the federal government has to act -- would have to act within the limitations of the Fifth.","start":1236.519,"stop":1253.842,"duration":17.32},{"text":"So that on this basis, as of 1948 or as of the present time, the implications of the Paul decision are shown by a hundred years of history to be less fraud than may appear at that time.","start":1253.842,"stop":1274.781,"duration":20.94},{"text":"And as a result, it seems that as I said in the first place, we don't consider this really a delegation.","start":1274.781,"stop":1284.521,"duration":9.74},{"text":"This is really Congress acting but even if it is thought to be delegation, the delegation is in a very limited area which circumscribed bounds and considering that we are dealing here not within an administrative agency.","start":1284.521,"stop":1307.485,"duration":22.96},{"text":"If -- if one thinks of it in terms of delegation, we are dealing with the problem that arises out of the fact that we are a federal system of government that such -- that we are dealing with an area which even now, is considered primarily the place where the judgment of the State as reflected by the State legislature, this is the area which under our system of government is primarily left for state legislation.","start":1307.485,"stop":1336.782,"duration":29.3},{"text":"On that basis, even as delegation, we think as of this time that delegation would be appropriate.","start":1336.782,"stop":1347.224,"duration":10.44},{"text":"But I would like to emphasize that in essence it is not delegation because its Congress that makes the policy and it is a policy which has it -- has its foundation of fact that conformity to state law is something which our system permit and which is rational under that system and that if you accept that as Paul and Franklin do, you accept the principle that there should be conformity and this is the actual conformity.","start":1347.224,"stop":1387.502,"duration":40.28},{"text":"This Court has held several times and particularly in relation to -- in Clark Distilling and Hornbuckle 242 United States that where Congress says, \"We will prohibit interstate commerce to things that are in violation of a policy of a State.\"","start":1387.502,"stop":1408.498,"duration":21},{"text":"For example, it is unlawful under federal law to ship liquor into a dry state.","start":1408.498,"stop":1416.455,"duration":7.96},{"text":"And this comes into effect in the future whenever a State decides to go dry if it does or it -- if the law ceases to have effect when the State decides not to be dry.","start":1416.455,"stop":1428.618,"duration":12.16},{"text":"This Court -- this Court held in Clark Distilling at that time that that was an unconstitutional delegation because it was the will of Congress that gave this statute its implications.","start":1428.618,"stop":1445.421,"duration":16.8},{"text":"It was the will of Congress that made the act criminal.","start":1445.421,"stop":1448.469,"duration":3.05},{"text":"Well, that's the same thing here.","start":1448.469,"stop":1450.065,"duration":1.6},{"text":"It is Congress -- if the policy of Congress, not the policy of the State, it's the policy of Congress that said, \"We think it's a good government for a federal enclave to have these on the whole minor laws conform to the laws of the surrounding State.\"","start":1450.065,"stop":1474.118,"duration":24.05},{"text":"And to that extent, we -- it is the federal will that makes this thing a crime and we think that the rational, although different, is very much the same because it is the will of Congress and it is based on a policy which under our federal system has validity.","start":1474.118,"stop":1497.377,"duration":23.26},{"text":"I just want to make one point in answer to my opponent's brief.","start":1497.377,"stop":1501.404,"duration":4.03},{"text":"And he cite the -- and placed assembly lines on the Penn Dairies case and the Pacific Coast Dairy case decided by this Court in 318 United States which deals with the field of regulation licensing.","start":1501.404,"stop":1519.973,"duration":18.57},{"text":"Those are cases which arise under the civil law and the civil law of federal enclave is different from the criminal because in the civil law, Congress has not acted except in very limited areas, taxation, workmen's compensation.","start":1519.973,"stop":1538.842,"duration":18.87},{"text":"On the civil law, Congress has not passed the equivalent of the Assimilative Crimes Act and this Court has said that what you apply there is the rule of international law that you take over the private law as it was at the time of session.","start":1538.842,"stop":1555.661,"duration":16.82},{"text":"But if the absence of action in a sense that has made the problems of federal enclave, these have been a subject to the two volume

field rather than the criminal.","start":1555.661,"stop":1581.701,"duration":26.04},{"text":"And one of the reasons for that is the very fact that Congress has not made -- affected general policy in
