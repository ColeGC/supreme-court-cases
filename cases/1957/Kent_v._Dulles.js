referred to very briefly are these.","start":87.313,"stop":92.241,"duration":4.93},{"text":"Dr. Walter Briehl is an American psychiatrist who's approximately is 27 years.","start":92.241,"stop":98.049,"duration":5.81},{"text":"He served as a lieutenant colonel in United States Army in charge of Army hospitals at the psychiatric parts of the hospitals.","start":98.049,"stop":105.913,"duration":7.86},{"text":"He is a practicing psychiatrist in Los Angeles and is connected with many medical societies, psychoanalytic, psychiatric and otherwise which I specified in the record.","start":105.913,"stop":118.267,"duration":12.35},{"text":"As a member of the society as a delegate of these medical societies, he has had occasion to travel abroad, most recently in 1953 with an American passport for the purpose of attending international conventions on mental health and on psychoanalysis and reporting back to his medical societies.","start":118.267,"stop":142.181,"duration":23.91},{"text":"He did that in 1953, and when he attempted to renew his passport in 1955 for the same purpose acting as a delegate of his medical societies, he received instead a typical letter from the Director of the Passport Office in which it was said, that certain allegations had been made against Dr. Briehl by persons who are not specified.","start":142.181,"stop":166.278,"duration":24.1},{"text":"The allegations were of course not for him, but we know that he had at one time unspecified been a member of the Communist Party and that he has been a member of a number of organizations on the Attorney General's list, three or four or five, or associated with him and that he had once petitioned to the President of the United States not to prosecute Communists under the Smith Act.","start":166.278,"stop":193.239,"duration":26.96},{"text":"And so, the Department had he made these charges against Dr. Briehl said to him in his letter, “We ask you now for an affidavit as to whether you have ever been a member of the Communist Party, ever, whether you are now, and we ask you also to explain under oath your connections with the Communist-front organizations which we have described in our letter and any other Communist-front organizations?”","start":193.239,"stop":223.397,"duration":30.16},{"text":"Dr. Briehl demanded a hearing, a quasi-judicial hearing in view of a recent decision of the Court of Appeals, Dulles against Nathan, and instead he received an informal hearing in the Passport Office in 1955 and which he was the only witness.","start":223.397,"stop":240.351,"duration":16.95},{"text":"No witnesses were offered by the Government in support of any of the allegations and instead, the Passport

Communist Party membership, Communist-front organizations so-called or his associations.","start":250.105,"stop":260.421,"duration":10.32},{"text":"And the Department refused to issue a passport to him, indeed, refused to act upon his passport application at all.","start":260.421,"stop":269.625,"duration":9.2},{"text":"Now, the case of Mr. Rockwell Kent is essentially the same.","start":269.625,"stop":273.495,"duration":3.87},{"text":"Mr. Kent is well-known explorer, writer and artist, internationally known of course, known -- I assume to the members of this

passports.","start":282.932,"stop":288.629,"duration":5.7},{"text":"Well, passports were required as they have more recently and I assume traveling without passports in the earlier years when they were not required.","start":288.629,"stop":297.708,"duration":9.08},{"text":"And the great created work manifested in his writings and in his art has been the product of this international travel.","start":297.708,"stop":307.699,"duration":9.99},{"text":"Mr. Kent applied in 1955 for a passport to travel abroad where as he said under oath, \"Pleasure and

issues.","start":380.133,"stop":388.712,"duration":8.58},{"text":"The fact is that Mr. Kent had a constitutional right to take all of these positions and at the same time to have the liberty of movement which is demanded.","start":388.712,"stop":397.184,"duration":8.47},{"text":"Now, both Mr. Kent -- Mr. Kent also, I may say, was given the same kind of informal hearing, only with two variations.","start":397.184,"stop":406.385,"duration":9.2},{"text":"His autobiography called “It's Me, O Lord” which he tells the entire philosophy of life as candidly as anyone could, was introduced in the evidence by the Passport Office.","start":406.385,"stop":418.371,"duration":11.99},{"text":"His book was put in there for the purpose of showing that Mr. Kent had admitted that he had been connected with the organizations on the Attorney General's list.","start":418.371,"stop":428.54,"duration":10.17},{"text":"And also, the Passport Office introduced testimony given by Mr. Kent before the McCarthy Committee in 1953 because the Department considered it significant that he had asserted his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.","start":428.54,"stop":445.535,"duration":17},{"text":"Both plaintiffs started these lawsuits which were dismissed in the District Court under the Secretary regulations and the dismissal was affirmed in the Court of Appeals.","start":445.535,"stop":456.34,"duration":10.8},{"text":"Now, I should of course give Your Honors first the regulations because they are -- before I give Your Honors the regulations, may I state two concessions made by the Government which has never been made in the course of these two years of litigation or indeed in the five years in which we have been litigating many other passport cases in the district.","start":456.34,"stop":475.751,"duration":19.41},{"text":"For the first time, we learned in this Court and into the credit of the

concession.","start":484.659,"stop":486.523,"duration":1.86},{"text":"They seek to undercut it but we'll discuss that later.","start":486.523,"stop":489.727,"duration":3.2},{"text":"Secondly, they,
