cases are denaturalization cases.","start":22.499,"stop":27.15,"duration":4.65},{"text":"Both of them involved two aliens who were naturalized in the year 1938 at Detroit and with respect to both of them, the cases were tried in the 1950s in Detroit before the same district judge and in 1955 the opinions and judgments directing the cancellation of their citizenship were issued by the District Court.","start":27.15,"stop":55.086,"duration":27.94},{"text":"In both cases, it is the Government's claim that at the time and prior to the naturalization of Mr. Nowak and Mrs. Maisenberg, they have been and were members of the Communist Party which the Government charge was an organization advocating the violent overthrow of the Government and that they knew and accrue thereof.","start":55.086,"stop":75.094,"duration":20.01},{"text":"The pleadings, facts and issues thus in both cases are the same, substantially the same with one exception which I will mention.","start":75.094,"stop":83.167,"duration":8.07},{"text":"In the Nowak case, the complaint was filed by the Government under the 1940 Nationality Act and under that Act and pursuant to its provisions, the Government charged that Mr. Nowak had obtained his citizenship through illegal procurement and by fraud.","start":83.167,"stop":102.499,"duration":19.33},{"text":"The Maisenberg case was brought by the Government under the 1952 Immigration and Naturalization Act and pursuant to the provisions of that Act, the complaint charged concealment and misrepresentation of material fact.","start":102.499,"stop":119.107,"duration":16.61},{"text":"For the purposes of the argument and because both parties have dealt at length with the issues in the case in the Nowak briefs, I would like to, with the Court's permission, argue the Nowak case until -- at least until the Court would like to have me mention something concerning the other case.","start":119.107,"stop":137.984,"duration":18.88},{"text":"I think that argument will dispose of as far as I'm concerned the major issues that are involved on this appeal.","start":137.984,"stop":145.244,"duration":7.26},{"text":"The facts in the Nowak case briefly and insofar as they are material here are as follows.","start":145.244,"stop":155.667,"duration":10.42},{"text":"Nowak was born in 1903 in Poland.","start":155.667,"stop":158.406,"duration":2.74},{"text":"He came to this country at the age of 10, 1913.","start":158.406,"stop":164.724,"duration":6.32},{"text":"He has lived here ever since.","start":164.724,"stop":167.01,"duration":2.29},{"text":"In 1937 at Detroit, he filed his preliminary form for naturalization as well -- later that year his petition for naturalization.","start":167.01,"stop":178.078,"duration":11.07},{"text":"And following several interrogations by the immigration people and after some investigation, in June of 1938 at Detroit he was granted his citizenship upon taking his oath in open court.","start":178.078,"stop":195.559,"duration":17.48},{"text":"Within six months or after, in November 1938, he was elected from his district to the state senate for the State of Michigan and was thereafter elected for five consecutive two-year terms until 1948.","start":195.559,"stop":211.627,"duration":16.07},{"text":"In December of 1942 which was about four years after he had been granted his naturalization.","start":211.627,"stop":219.194,"duration":7.57},{"text":"The Government obtained from the grand jury in the District Court of Detroit an indictment -- a criminal indictment against Mr. Nowak, charging him with having falsified during the course of his naturalization proceedings swearing falsely in there.","start":219.194,"stop":233.244,"duration":14.05},{"text":"The Government at that time contended the indictment that he had concealed the fact that he was a member of the Communist Party, an organization which at that time the indictment charge was one which thought opposition to organized Government.","start":233.244,"stop":248.096,"duration":14.85},{"text":"Several months later in February 1943, the Government of its own motion dismissed the indictment and it was never reinstated.","start":248.096,"stop":256.744,"duration":8.65},{"text":"Approximately 10 years later, December the 23rd, 1952, two days before the new 1952 Immigration and Naturalization Act went into effect.","start":256.744,"stop":267.53,"duration":10.79},{"text":"This complaint was filed.","start":267.53,"stop":269.962,"duration":2.43},{"text":"The complaint was filed accompanied by an affidavit of a Ruben Spicer which set forth what is alleged to be good cause for the institution of the proceedings and I will refer to the affidavit in my argument on that point.","start":269.962,"stop":285.524,"duration":15.56},{"text":"But the complaint charged both illegality and fraud by virtue of alleged membership in the Communist Party, an organization which the complaint at that time charged was one which advocated the violent overthrow of the Government and that he had knowledge of and accrued of that advocacy.","start":285.524,"stop":305.547,"duration":20.02},{"text":"The case was tried.","start":305.547,"stop":307.93,"duration":2.38},{"text":"The Government presented, I believe, 12 witnesses.","start":307.93,"stop":312.784,"duration":4.85},{"text":"Two of whom testified concerning a claim of the Government that he had falsified by denying membership in the Communist Party orally.","start":312.784,"stop":320.687,"duration":7.9},{"text":"However, the District Court, in its opinion, found that evidence to be insufficient and -- and dismissed that allegation of fraud.","start":320.687,"stop":329.886,"duration":9.2},{"text":"The other witnesses testified as to the aims and objectives of the Communist Party, introduced a number of books and literature which however were not attributed to the defendant but in support of the so-called expert's opinion that they helped to fortify the expert's opinion that the Communist Party did advocate violence to overthrow the Government.","start":329.886,"stop":352.309,"duration":22.42},{"text":"A number of other witnesses testified that Mr. Nowak had been a member of the Communist Party, had attended meetings of the Communist Party and attributed certain statements to him particularly three of the greatest importance in the Government's case which it is contended by the Government and was found by the trial court to constitute advocacy on his part or at least knowledge of the advocacy by the Communist Party of violent overthrow of the Government and the court's opinion found that his citizenship should be canceled on the ground of both illegality and fraud.","start":352.309,"stop":391.878,"duration":39.57},{"text":"I would like to argue insofar as I am to be able to the course of my argument following three points.","start":391.878,"stop":399.554,"duration":7.68},{"text":"First, because of maybe the jurisdictional question one which the Court may want to hear argument that the affidavit of good cause is insufficient in this case under the ruling of this Court in the Zucca decision.","start":399.554,"stop":413.959,"duration":14.41},{"text":"Secondly, I would like to argue that their -- that the charge of illegal procurement under the 1940 Act has no support and in any event is outlawed under the principle of res judicata.","start":413.959,"stop":428.661,"duration":14.7},{"text":"Third, I would like to argue that the claim of fraud in the theory at least on which it is stated by the Government in this case and upon which the evidence was produced has not been proved.","start":428.661,"stop":441.845,"duration":13.18},{"text":"First, with respect to the affidavit, in order to discuss that I -- I want to just briefly refer to the Zucca opinion which this Court found that -- two things as I read the opinion at least, one that an affidavit was a prerequisite to the initiation of a proceeding of this kind.","start":441.845,"stop":464.699,"duration":22.85},{"text":"There being no affidavit in that case of any kind.The Court -- the majority of opinion held that the complaint should have been dismissed.","start":464.699,"stop":473.577,"duration":8.88},{"text":"And secondly, an ancillary holding in the opinion was that the verification of the complaint itself by the assistant district attorney was -- which was based upon the examination of the files in that case was insufficient and did not take the place of the affidavit which this Court found was necessary to the maintenance of the proceeding.","start":473.577,"stop":498.737,"duration":25.16},{"text":"Now, the Spicer affidavit that is the affidavit signed by Ruben Spicer in this case which is the same practically in both Maisenberg and the Nowak case and appears likewise and many of the other decided cases the affidavit by Spicer is an affidavit by the attorney for the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the affidavit states that it is based upon an examination of the files of the service.","start":498.737,"stop":532.284,"duration":33.55},{"text":"This morning, I had an opportunity of checking the records and brief in the Zucca case, so this point is not in our brief.","start":532.284,"stop":540.82,"duration":8.54},{"text":"But in checking the -- the complaint in the Zucca opinion and comparing it in detail with the affidavit of Mr. Spicer in this case, the allegations are essentially the same and the language is almost similar, many of the paragraphs are exactly the like -- alike in specific language and specific allusions and with respect to the formulations.","start":540.82,"stop":567.641,"duration":26.82},{"text":"For all practical purposes, a comparison of the complaint in the Zucca case and the Spicer affidavit in this case, I think we'll make it very clear that the affidavits or the complaint and the affidavit are practically the same and the comparison of the affidavits in both the cases before the Court will indicate that it is essentially a form of affidavit or in the Zucca case a complaint.","start":567.641,"stop":592.147,"duration":24.51},{"text":"So what we have here in connection with this issue as we see it is a question as to whether a sworn complaint is filed in the Zucca case which was held to be insufficient by the court there where treated in the same form as an affidavit attached to the complaint would be sufficient wherein both instances it's based solely upon examination of the files and records.","start":592.147,"stop":623.606,"duration":31.46},{"text":"Now in order to state our position on it, I would like to first indicate the extent to which I think the Government mistakes our position in its brief.","start":623.606,"stop":633.135,"duration":9.53},{"text":"They've state our position I think because it makes it much easier to justify its own position, but their position argued for by the Government in its brief is not our position.","start":633.135,"stop":644.79,"duration":11.65},{"text":"But the Government there claims that what we assert and what we seek this Court to do is that we claim they say that the affidavit must be “A product of eyewitness observation” that's in the Government's brief on page 47.","start":644.79,"stop":662.85,"duration":18.06},{"text":"We make no such claim or do we think that the Court would be justified in holding the Government to any such position.Our position as argued in our brief and as it is here is that the affidavit that's required by the Government before they institute a naturalization proceeding is one which is similar in nature, two, an affidavit which is required in order to obtain a search warrant or one that's required in order to justify expedition proceeding.","start":662.85,"stop":697.716,"duration":34.87},{"text":"Many decisions in both areas have pretty well made clear that in -- at least those fields, an affidavit which is required there is one which not need not be based upon eyewitness observation.","start":697.716,"stop":716.075,"duration":18.36},{"text":"I think if any rule is to be applied to them.","start":716.075,"stop":718.239,"duration":2.16},{"text":"It's perhaps the one that's used by Wigmore extensively in his discussion of evidence.","start":718.239,"stop":724.555,"duration":6.32},{"text":"That is -- there must be some circumstantial probability of the trustworthiness of the evidence set forth in the affidavit.","start":724.555,"stop":732.686,"duration":8.13},{"text":"I don't quote that from any decision of the Court but I think generally that is what the cases hold.","start":732.686,"stop":737.478,"duration":4.79},{"text":"And would -- I think the rule that might well apply.","start":737.478,"stop":740.981,"duration":3.5},{"text":"In this Court's decision in Zucca, you mentioned in the majority opinion, an opinion issued shortly after the 1906 Act was passed by then Attorney General Bonaparte which held or which was an opinion stating that a request for the institution of denaturalization proceedings requested from the department head in the form of an affidavit was sufficient to justify the institution of those proceeding.","start":740.981,"stop":777.633,"duration":36.65},{"text":"In its brief, the Government here, not only mention that particular opinion but at page 53 of its brief, sets forth the letter from Mr. Strauss to the Attorney General which he sets forth in detail, the nature of the evidence presented as good cause for the institution of the denaturalization proceeding.","start":777.633,"stop":798.821,"duration":21.19},{"text":"Now, if the Court will examine the Strauss letter, it is clear, I think, from the letter itself that what was submitted to the Attorney General as good cause was not a hearsay statement based upon examination of file such as its present in the Spicer affidavit.","start":798.821,"stop":816.788,"duration":17.97},{"text":"Rather what was present there was a -- a group of authenticated documents, copies of which were attached and of duly authenticated which set forth precisely and in detail and in the form of substantive original evidence.","start":816.788,"stop":835.257,"duration":18.47},{"text":"The nature of the claim presented to the Attorney General that the alien in that case was not -- was over the age of 18 when he applied for a citizenship contrary to the statute.","start":835.257,"stop":849.182,"duration":13.93},{"text":"So that if one were to compare that particular proceeding with the Spicer proceeding, one would have to say that Spicer should have if his affidavit were to be based upon the same kind of evidence present in the other case, some original documentation or evidence which would have supported the ultimate conclusions which this affidavit consisted at.","start":849.182,"stop":873.512,"duration":24.33},{"text":"I further call the Court's attention on this respect as an illustration of the kind of an affidavit which I think the Government ought to be compelled to file if it wants to institute these proceedings.","start":873.512,"stop":884.321,"duration":10.81},{"text":"The case of Brinegar versus the United States, this is cited not in our brief but in the Government's brief on page 65.","start":884.321,"stop":891.724,"duration":7.4},{"text":"This deals with search and seizure not with denaturalization proceedings but I think the principle is well-stated there because in that case, if the Government relies on -- on the assumption that sufficient -- an affidavit is sufficient which is based upon hearsay or at least none eyewitness observation, the Court -- this Court said that the officers who made the search and seizure following an arrest without a search warrant in that case had personal knowledge and that search and seizure in that case were sufficiently based upon the personal knowledge of the officer.","start":891.724,"stop":930.241,"duration":38.52},{"text":"But in dealing generally with the problems of officers in connection with searches and seizures, they -- they make the observation that in dealing with probable cost we deal with probabilities.","start":930.241,"stop":941.751,"duration":11.51},{"text":"And here where a good cause which is tantamount to probable cost I -- I assume we also can deal with probabilities.","start":941.751,"stop":950.65,"duration":8.9},{"text":"That does not mean here's a conclusion by somebody who examined the file but it deals more with -- it deals with some basic facts, some basic information, some records which the court can examine at the outset of the case and determine from its own observation, on the basis of his own exercise of his own legal judgment whether in fact the material upon which the Government relies for good cause justifies the -- the conclusion that it is a good cause.","start":950.65,"stop":981.786,"duration":31.14}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"May I ask you Mr. Goodman whether affidavits by persons whose statements were in the Department of Justice, filed on the basis of which the officer made the affidavit would have satisfied your criteria, your

think the criterion then would be.","start":1015.214,"stop":1020.203,"duration":4.99},{"text":"Could the court by examining the basic evidence which Mr. Spicer apparently examined, in examining this evidence, have reached the same conclusion that Mr. Spicer did as an illustration.","start":1020.203,"stop":1032.305,"duration":12.1},{"text":"The Government in this case and its complaint charged not only the allegations I have mentioned but another one.","start":1032.305,"stop":1037.588,"duration":5.28},{"text":"They charge that Mr. Nowak at the time he became a citizen oath his allegiance to the Soviet Union and that, however, because of his conduct in subsequent action, he did not disavowed that allegiance and maintained its allegiance.","start":1037.588,"stop":1053.691,"duration":16.1},{"text":"Now no evidence was ever produced on that of any kind or any claim made further -- except what's in the affidavit, whether there was any basis for that statement in Mr. Spicer's affidavit or not, nobody knows merely his conclusion.","start":1053.691,"stop":1067.093,"duration":13.4},{"text":"It may well be that there's nothing in the Government's file which would permit the making of such a statement yet it appeared and no court could determine whether it was justified or not or gave rise to good cause or not unless you
