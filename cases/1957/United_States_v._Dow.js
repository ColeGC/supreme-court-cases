point.","start":656.786,"stop":662.166,"duration":5.38},{"text":"It seems to me that much of the confusion of the Court of Appeals was due to the failure to distinguish between a taking and a passage of title.","start":662.166,"stop":676.534,"duration":14.37},{"text":"And this confusion has all wrapped up inside of it, a failure to distinguish between the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the

Amendment merely limits the exercise of that problem to the extent that it requires the payment of just compensation.","start":710.198,"stop":721.405,"duration":11.21},{"text":"However, it does not require as many state constitutions require that the compensation be paid in advance or contemporaneously with the taking.","start":721.405,"stop":740.104,"duration":18.7},{"text":"And so, when the

determined, the sooner the better it will suit me.","start":759.312,"stop":773.136,"duration":13.82},{"text":"The landowner nevertheless has his adequate remedy to obtain compensation for the taking by bringing his own case against the Government under the Tucker Act.","start":773.136,"stop":784.83,"duration":11.69},{"text":"And consequently, unauthorized taking cannot be prevented by injunction
