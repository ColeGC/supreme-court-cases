the one that you have just heard, involves a conviction under the membership clause of the Smith Act.","start":27.32,"stop":36.569,"duration":9.25},{"text":"The indictments in the two cases are identical except for the names of the defendants and allegations as to venue.","start":36.569,"stop":45.453,"duration":8.88},{"text":"The trial here, which was the first trial under the membership clause, preceded that by -- in Scales by some three months.","start":45.453,"stop":54.192,"duration":8.74},{"text":"The indictment, I may say, was returned in May of 1954.","start":54.192,"stop":59.686,"duration":5.49},{"text":"Petitioner was sentenced to a $5000 fine and a five-year prison sentence, and the conviction was affirmed in the Seventh Circuit.","start":59.686,"stop":69.077,"duration":9.39},{"text":"This case, like Scales, raises questions as to the constitutionality of the membership clause on its face and the effect of Section 4 (f) of the Internal Security Act as a bar to the indictment.","start":69.077,"stop":85.222,"duration":16.14},{"text":"I shall have something to add to what has already been said on those questions a little later.","start":85.222,"stop":91.522,"duration":6.3},{"text":"But I first want to discuss our contention that the record in this case required a judgement of acquittal.","start":91.522,"stop":100.635,"duration":9.11},{"text":"Important questions concerning the evidence necessary to sustain a Smith Act conviction had been argued in the Yates or submitted in the Yates and Scales cases.","start":100.635,"stop":116.253,"duration":15.62},{"text":"I believe, however, that this record presents in the sharpest and most extreme form the question as to whether a Communist defendant in a Smith Act case is to be entitled to the long accepted and constitutionally protected standards governing proof of guilt.","start":116.253,"stop":142.519,"duration":26.27},{"text":"Before I come to the facts, I should like to make two preliminary observations.","start":142.519,"stop":148.319,"duration":5.8},{"text":"First, in contradistinction to the Yates case, the testimony here, fortunately, occupies less than 500 pages of the record and indeed, the disputed questions of fact -- as I think they appear from our brief and the respondent's brief, relate to, perhaps, four matters involving no more than a dozen pages of the record.","start":148.319,"stop":175.708,"duration":27.39},{"text":"Second, during the argument in Yates, Mr. Justice Harlan asked this question.","start":175.708,"stop":184.433,"duration":8.72},{"text":"If the Communist Party had been the defendant, would there have been enough evidence to go to the jury on the question of its advocacy of prescribed doctrine?","start":184.433,"stop":195.517,"duration":11.08},{"text":"The answer to that question, Mr. Justice Harlan, in this case is a clear unqualified and unequivocal no.","start":195.517,"stop":204.348,"duration":8.83},{"text":"This for the reason among others, that the only witness for the prosecution on that branch of the case testified that the advocacy of the organization was peaceable.","start":204.348,"stop":216.457,"duration":12.11},{"text":"I shall return to that point later.","start":216.457,"stop":220.181,"duration":3.72},{"text":"At the trial, the petitioner acknowledged that he had been a member and officer of the Communist Party for many years.","start":220.181,"stop":227.545,"duration":7.36},{"text":"He had held various offices in the Illinois organization and, at the time of the indictment, was also an alternate member of the National Committee of the national organization.","start":227.545,"stop":240.084,"duration":12.54},{"text":"Thus, the issues of fact were confined to his knowledge and intent.","start":240.084,"stop":245.365,"duration":5.28},{"text":"First, during a three-year statutory period did he know the Communist Party as a society of persons who, in the language of incitement, advocated the violent overthrow of the Government as soon as circumstances would permit.","start":245.365,"stop":262.421,"duration":17.06},{"text":"And second, during that three-year period did he personally have the specific intent to bring about such overthrow as soon as circumstances would permit.","start":262.421,"stop":273.171,"duration":10.75},{"text":"And may I say parenthetically here to dispose of that question at once the Medina incitement instruction was given in this case.","start":273.171,"stop":282.097,"duration":8.93},{"text":"The prosecution called eight witnesses whose testimony was material and offered a number of exhibits.","start":282.097,"stop":287.723,"duration":5.63},{"text":"The petitioner called no witnesses and offered but one exhibit.","start":287.723,"stop":292.36,"duration":4.64},{"text":"All of the prosecution witnesses were former members of the Communist Party.","start":292.36,"stop":297.644,"duration":5.28},{"text":"Five had been FBI informers throughout their membership and the sixth, the ubiquitous Lautner, who, I believe, has been a prosecution witness in every Smith Act case since Dennis, was a full-time Department of Justice employee at the time he testified.","start":297.644,"stop":316.481,"duration":18.84},{"text":"The evidence on the crucial issue of the petitioner's own acts and declarations spanned 19 years of his life and membership in the Communist Party.","start":316.481,"stop":326.617,"duration":10.14},{"text":"It falls into four categories, his attendance and speeches at Communist Party meetings, private conversations, his teaching in Communist Party schools and finally, his published writings.","start":326.617,"stop":341.215,"duration":14.6},{"text":"FBI informers testified the petitioner's attendance at a total of 16 meetings between 1945 and 1951 at which he or other Communists spoke.","start":341.215,"stop":352.366,"duration":11.15},{"text":"Only three of these incidentally occurred during a three-year statutory period.","start":352.366,"stop":357.532,"duration":5.17},{"text":"I have included what I think is a painstaking summary of the testimony as to all 16 meetings in an -- in an appendix to our brief the accuracy of which the Government does not challenge.","start":357.532,"stop":374.442,"duration":16.91},{"text":"If this testimony is accepted in its entirety, it establishes no more than that the petitioner or other speakers called for the building of a Communist Party particularly among the Negro people and working people urge Communists to work more effectively in trade unions and veterans organizations, express confidence in the eventual establishment of socialism in this country, praise the Soviet Union and its leaders, oppose the Cold War policies of the Truman administration, denounced legislative committees investigating communism and advise Communists not to reveal their membership publicly, if to do so would jeopardize their positions in the community.","start":374.442,"stop":422.701,"duration":48.26},{"text":"Two witnesses, Meyer and Skinner, who incidentally were the only two not then or formerly on the payroll of the FBI, testified to their presence at or participation in the conversations with the petitioner.","start":422.701,"stop":437.665,"duration":14.96},{"text":"Ms. Skinner testified that in the years 1947-1948, she frequently saw petitioner at the Chicago party headquarters where he talked with the party officials there, but she wasn't asked and didn't testify about the content of any of these conversations.","start":437.665,"stop":454.747,"duration":17.08},{"text":"The witness Meyer knew petitioner intimately and worked with him closely in the Communist Party during the eight years, from 1934 to 1942.","start":454.747,"stop":464.228,"duration":9.48},{"text":"They had innumerable discussions concerning the theoretical and practical aspects of Communist Party work.","start":464.228,"stop":471.432,"duration":7.2},{"text":"In 1940, the two men held an extended discussion of the courses on Marxism-Leninism, which petitioner was then teaching.","start":471.432,"stop":479.83,"duration":8.4},{"text":"They went over the books by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, the so-called \"classics\" that petitioner used in these classes.","start":479.83,"stop":487.288,"duration":7.46},{"text":"Meyer was able to identify the specific pages of these books which they had discussed some 14 or 15 years previously.","start":487.288,"stop":497.13,"duration":9.84},{"text":"He testified that he and the petitioner reached agreement on what should be taught and how it should be taught.","start":497.13,"stop":504.388,"duration":7.26},{"text":"But the prosecution never asked him what that agreement was.","start":504.388,"stop":509.923,"duration":5.54},{"text":"Certainly, if the petitioner had understood the Communist Party or these books to advocate the violent overthrow of our Government, he would have said so in the course of these lengthy and searching conversations with Meyer.","start":509.923,"stop":524.256,"duration":14.33},{"text":"But the prosecution sedulously avoided asking Meyer what was said and the witness gave no testimony whatsoever concerning the subject of these conversations or what was said in these conversations.","start":524.256,"stop":539.162,"duration":14.91},{"text":"Two witnesses, Meyer and Ms. Skinner, testified that they had attended a number of petitioner's classes of principles of Marxism-Leninism, but they weren't asked and they didn't testify as to what petitioner taught them.","start":539.162,"stop":553.103,"duration":13.94},{"text":"A third witness, the informer Brzek, attended two of petitioner's lectures at a school held in 1947, eight years before the trial.","start":553.103,"stop":565.862,"duration":12.76},{"text":"It is simply impossible to paraphrase the witnesses' incoherent and (Inaudible) of account of what petitioner is supposed to have said.","start":565.862,"stop":575.63,"duration":9.77},{"text":"I quote the essence of our -- of his testimony at page 10 of our brief and it appears in full at record 460, 462.","start":575.63,"stop":584.665,"duration":9.03},{"text":"I invite the Court to take a look at it.","start":584.665,"stop":587.841,"duration":3.18},{"text":"Brzek's version of petitioner's remark is studded with references to blood and bloodshed.","start":587.841,"stop":594.613,"duration":6.77},{"text":"But according to the witness, petitioner, and I quote him, \"went on to explain that it wouldn't be a shooting, it would be more quiet methods of doing that blood,\" end of it.","start":594.613,"stop":607.18,"duration":12.57},{"text":"Now, just what the nature of this more quiet method of doing the blood end of it was was never elucidated in the testimony.","start":607.18,"stop":615.814,"duration":8.63},{"text":"Brzek also testified that petitioner, in this same lecture, repeatedly emphasize, and I quote him, \"That we will try to avoid bloodshed and we will approach it to avoid bloodshed,\" and then concluded his lecture with this statement, \"However, we will not be pushed off, if we have to shed blood, we will.\"","start":615.814,"stop":639.087,"duration":23.27},{"text":"Now, I submit, at the very most that can be spelled out of this confused and confusing police by story is that far from advocating violence, petitioner urged its avoidance and that most warned of a possible reluctant resort to force at some time in the future, if this became necessary as a measure of self-defense.","start":639.087,"stop":664.485,"duration":25.4},{"text":"I should add that the witness, Ms. Skinner, who preceded Brzek to the stand, testified that she attended the same sessions of the 1947 school.","start":664.485,"stop":675.975,"duration":11.49},{"text":"But the prosecution carefully refrained from asking her what petitioner had taught them.","start":675.975,"stop":682.424,"duration":6.45},{"text":"Now, the only other evidence of petitioner's acts and declarations consist of some of his published speeches and articles.","start":682.424,"stop":690.362,"duration":7.94},{"text":"These show that he has been highly critical of many aspects of the foreign and domestic policies of the national administration, his expressed admiration of the Soviet Union and its leaders.","start":690.362,"stop":703.006,"duration":12.64},{"text":"He believes in the ultimate establishment of socialism in this country.","start":703.006,"stop":707.492,"duration":4.49},{"text":"And he is very deeply concerned by the discrimination and violence practiced against his people, the Negro people.","start":707.492,"stop":716.23,"duration":8.74},{"text":"The Court will doubtless find many of his ideas distasteful and may consider some of his language intemperate.","start":716.23,"stop":724.274,"duration":8.04},{"text":"But it will find that the articles contain no discussion whatsoever of the means for bringing about socialism in the United States.","start":724.274,"stop":732.972,"duration":8.7},{"text":"And that far from advocating violence, they demonstrate petitioner's abhorrence of its use in any form or for any purpose.","start":732.972,"stop":743.014,"duration":10.04},{"text":"Petitioner's writings state that he is in adherent of the principles of Marxism-Leninism.","start":743.014,"stop":748.848,"duration":5.83},{"text":"And they contain the only evidence in the entire record of his understanding of the meaning and application of these principles.","start":748.848,"stop":756.884,"duration":8.04},{"text":"Significantly, the petitioner wrote, and I quote him, \"Marxism-Leninism gives us the power of orientation.","start":756.884,"stop":765.728,"duration":8.84},{"text":"It enables us to perceive the direction in which things are heading.","start":765.728,"stop":770.428,"duration":4.7},{"text":"It does not nor can it determine for us beforehand the form nor the exact time of a new social development.\"","start":770.428,"stop":781.605,"duration":11.18},{"text":"With that, I have now summarized all of the evidence concerning petitioner's acts and declarations.","start":781.605,"stop":789.096,"duration":7.49},{"text":"Respondent's counter-statement of the facts in the main confirms the accuracy of my summary.","start":789.096,"stop":795.744,"duration":6.65},{"text":"Respondent, however, resorts to three devices in an attempt to squeeze some evidence of guilt out of this arid record.","start":795.744,"stop":805.129,"duration":9.38},{"text":"These are dealt with fully in my reply brief.","start":805.129,"stop":807.841,"duration":2.71},{"text":"I only touched on them here.","start":807.841,"stop":810.441,"duration":2.6},{"text":"First, the respondent Ms. Tates the Brzek bloodshed story to make it appear that the witness quoted the petitioner as saying, and I quote from respondent's brief, \"Bloodshed is a pre-condition of the successful revolution, is necessary to obtain the objectives of the party and is on the agenda.\"","start":810.441,"stop":829.738,"duration":19.3},{"text":"These words so out of character, if they had been spoken by the witness, are not his reference supplied by the respondent.","start":829.738,"stop":838.991,"duration":9.25},{"text":"Second --","start":838.991,"stop":839.567,"duration":0.58}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"It is supplied by

Abt","textObjs":[{"text":"The respondent, Your Honor.","start":840.805,"stop":843.934,"duration":3.13},{"text":"Second, the respondent excises two of the petitioner's published articles to give them a sinister significance which the full text negatives.","start":843.934,"stop":854.709,"duration":10.77},{"text":"Respondent's tendentious excerpts and the context from which they were wrenched are set forth at pages 2 and 3 of our reply brief.","start":854.709,"stop":864.55,"duration":9.84},{"text":"Third, respondent asserts that petitioner, and I quote from respondent's brief, \"repeatedly endorsed and enjoined upon others the party principles of military discipline and preparation for violence.\"","start":864.55,"stop":880.522,"duration":15.97},{"text":"But then document seized assertions by references to the following, first, to its embroidered version of the Brzek bloodshed tale, second, to its excise version of petitioner's articles and finally, to such patently innocent matters, as petitioner's statement that the Russian Revolution succeeded under the wise leadership of Lenin and Stalin.","start":880.522,"stop":906.459,"duration":25.94},{"text":"Petitioner's likening of the Communist Party to David and its enemies to Goliath and finally to the fact that the conclusion of a meeting, petitioner asked the audience to rise and join him in the singing of \"The Internationale\".","start":906.459,"stop":920.209,"duration":13.75},{"text":"Now, obviously, neither the distortions nor the trivialities can serve as a substitute for proof.","start":920.209,"stop":927.827,"duration":7.62},{"text":"And as a matter of fact, the case was tried and decided and quite a different theory of guilt.","start":927.827,"stop":937.53,"duration":9.7},{"text":"That theory takes us to its point of departure excerpts from the so-called classical literature of Communism, the political polemics of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin written some 30 to 100 years ago.","start":937.53,"stop":953.038,"duration":15.51},{"text":"From this, it derives the following inferences and hypothesis, first, the excerpts in the words of the Court of Appeals, and I quote, \"advocated the violent overthrow of capitalist governments as speedly as circumstances would permit\".","start":953.038,"stop":971.61,"duration":18.57},{"text":"Second, since such advocacy appears in the so-called classical literature, it is a permanent and immutable dogma of Marxism-Leninism applicable to all capitalist governments, including the United States, at all times and under all circumstances.","start":971.61,"stop":991.06,"duration":19.45},{"text":"Third, since the Communist Party acknowledges its adherence to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, current advocacy amounting to incitement of the violent overthrow of our Government as soon as circumstances permit can be imputed to that organization.","start":991.06,"stop":1008.559,"duration":17.5},{"text":"Fourth, since the petitioner was an active member and officer of the Communist Party, thus familiar with this classical literature and thought in Communist Party schools, knowledge of the teaching and advocacy thus imputed to the Communist Party can be imputed likewise to petitioner.","start":1008.559,"stop":1028.217,"duration":19.66},{"text":"And finally, from the same bare facts, there can also be imputed to petitioner the specific intent to bring about the violent overthrow of the Government as soon as circumstances permit.","start":1028.217,"stop":1040.114,"duration":11.9},{"text":"The experienced trial judge, Judge Sullivan, adopted this theory of guilt only with the greatest reluctance, stating that what he referred to as the so-called Communist cases had modified the rules of evidence that he knew anything about and change the law as he had practiced it during his many years on the bench.","start":1040.114,"stop":1063.21,"duration":23.1},{"text":"Now, there are two things wrong with the theory applied below.","start":1063.21,"stop":1067.771,"duration":4.56},{"text":"First, the inferences on which it were -- was based are refuted by the evidence.","start":1067.771,"stop":1076.414,"duration":8.64},{"text":"And second, even were that not the case, the -- the conviction of the petitioner on the basis of this kind of suspicious deductive logic provides a supreme example of what Mr. Justice Minton once called guessing a man into a federal penitentiary.","start":1076.414,"stop":1099.297,"duration":22.88},{"text":"As to the first fallacy, the uncontradicted evidence rebuts the tenuous inference relied on below that the Communist Party advocated revolutionary violence.","start":1099.297,"stop":1111.833,"duration":12.54},{"text":"Indeed, as I've indicated before, the evidence offered by the prosecution establishes the exact contrary.","start":1111.833,"stop":1122.589,"duration":10.76},{"text":"The only witness on this branch of the prosecution's case was the ineffable Lautner, who had never so much as exchanged a word with the petitioner or heard him speak.","start":1122.589,"stop":1134.861,"duration":12.27},{"text":"Now, Lautner's testimony differed here in two respects, from at which he gave them other Smith Act cases including the Scales and Mesarosh -- Mesarosh case and Mr. Justice Harlan, the Flynn case with which of course you're very familiar.First, the prosecution confined its examination solely to qualifying Lautner as an expert by having him recite his positions in the Communist Party.","start":1134.861,"stop":1163.799,"duration":28.94},{"text":"And then eliciting his opinion over our objection as to the meaning of Marxism-Leninism and the objectives of the Communist Party, he testified solely in his capacity as a so-called expert opinion testimony.","start":1163.799,"stop":1179.077,"duration":15.28},{"text":"Second, and more importantly, whether because of the novelty of the role in which he found himself cast are for some other reason the witness dropped his key lines, which had been so well reversed in other cases.","start":1179.077,"stop":1194.14,"duration":15.06},{"text":"The result is like a performance of Hamlet without the soliloquies.","start":1194.14,"stop":1199.582,"duration":5.44},{"text":"Lautner did not testify at either Marxism-Leninism or the Communist Party advocated the violent overthrow of the Government.","start":1199.582,"stop":1208.256,"duration":8.67},{"text":"His answers on direct examination are set forth in full on our brief, pages 14 and 15.","start":1208.256,"stop":1217.051,"duration":8.79},{"text":"True, he used the words \"revolution\" and \"destruction\", but as the trial court properly instructed the jury, neither of these terms implies the use of force or violence.","start":1217.051,"stop":1231.178,"duration":14.13},{"text":"Any possible ambiguity in the direct testimony was resolved on cross-examination.","start":1231.178,"stop":1237.206,"duration":6.03},{"text":"When the witness stated unequivocally that it was the position of the Communist Party that of socialism could not be peacefully established in this country by elections and parliamentary methods, it would be only because the trust and monopolies would try to prevent the effectuation of the popular will by themselves resorting to violence.","start":1237.206,"stop":1259.651,"duration":22.45},{"text":"The question and the answer on cross-examination are reproduced at pages 35 and 36 of my brief.","start":1259.651,"stop":1268.71,"duration":9.06},{"text":"Thus, the prosecution's own expert testified that the advocacy of the Communist Party was peaceable.","start":1268.71,"stop":1276.694,"duration":7.98},{"text":"The respondent devotes an appendix to its brief to an attempted demonstration that the Communist Party advocated proscribed doctrine.","start":1276.694,"stop":1286.873,"duration":10.18},{"text":"Apart from quotations from the classics and the embroidered version of the Brzek story, which I have just mentioned, there was

no such statement.","start":1317.287,"stop":1321.318,"duration":4.03},{"text":"Its attribution to him is a pure invention as a reading of respondent's own reference to the record reveals, and the
