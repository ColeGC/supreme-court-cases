would be needed.","start":381.685,"stop":392.582,"duration":10.9},{"text":"He stated that the most important factor in determining whether a blood test was required in any particular case was whether

cross-examination, this witness, although he conceded that the consular investigation factor was a long standing factor in determining whether blood test would be needed, this witness conceded that in

necessary.","start":440.457,"stop":466.354,"duration":25.9},{"text":"At that time in those proceedings before Dimock -- Judge Dimock, the Government placed sole reliance on the birth certificate as

be prejudicial, Your Honor.","start":535.593,"stop":544.227,"duration":8.63},{"text":"Petitioners went ahead to prove their contention that Chinese, all Chinese, regardless of whether or not they have birth certificates and regardless of whether or not they were born in areas which were accessible to consular investigation, were always required to take a blood test and other persons never were.","start":544.227,"stop":564.693,"duration":20.47},{"text":"The form of proof which the petitioners introduced consisted of several cases of Chinese infants who were born in the British territory of Hong Kong.","start":564.693,"stop":575.085,"duration":10.39},{"text":"None of these infants exceeded the age of six.","start":575.085,"stop":578.747,"duration":3.66},{"text":"Each one of these

certificate.","start":585.046,"stop":591.005,"duration":5.96},{"text":"His parents had British marriage certificates.","start":591.005,"stop":593.793,"duration":2.79},{"text":"In one of these cases, the American consul himself had issued a birth certificate for the child.","start":593.793,"stop":600.354,"duration":6.56},{"text":"And most important, there is a large American consul staff in Hong Kong and these applicants were thoroughly investigated.","start":600.354,"stop":608.816,"duration":8.46},{"text":"Nevertheless, each one of these children, two of them being only one-and-a-half years of age were required to take a blood test.","start":608.816,"stop":618.732,"duration":9.92},{"text":"Now, on the face of this record, Judge Dimock found that the policy of the Immigration Service was to blood test all Chinese and no whites and he sustained the writ.","start":618.732,"stop":630.525,"duration":11.79},{"text":"Now, the Circuit Court with Judge Frank dissenting conceded that the petitioners in this case had proved that there were 500 cases of Chinese blood testing.","start":630.525,"stop":641.72,"duration":11.2},{"text":"That there were no cases of Chinese exemptions and that there was no evidence of any white person blood tested.","start":641.72,"stop":648.973,"duration":7.25},{"text":"But the Circuit Court reasoned that the petitioners had failed to prove discrimination because they have failed to prove that the Immigration Service officials were actuated by an evil motive or conscious racial prejudice.","start":648.973,"stop":664.586,"duration":15.61},{"text":"This Court granted certiorari limited to the sole issue of racial -- whether or not racial discrimination was practiced in this case.","start":664.586,"stop":678.103,"duration":13.52},{"text":"Now, petitioners submit that the factual issue tried administratively and reviewed by the District Court was whether in fact all Chinese were blood tested or whether the blood test extended to white persons.","start":678.103,"stop":693.566,"duration":15.46},{"text":"The Government itself put this issue in question by contending that blood tests were not restricted to Chinese but were applied to all persons without birth certificates.","start":693.566,"stop":705.233,"duration":11.67},{"text":"Then the Government later changed this position and claimed that blood tests were imposed on all persons, Chinese and non-Chinese alike who were born in areas which were not accessible to an investigation by the American consul.","start":705.233,"stop":719.303,"duration":14.07},{"text":"The petitioners submit that we have shown that these two excuses advanced by the Government for blood testing Chinese only are really inconsistent and tardy afterthoughts.","start":719.303,"stop":732.618,"duration":13.32},{"text":"We think further that the citation of the several cases of blood testing of Hong Kong Chinese infants who have birth certificates and who are accessible to a consular investigation prove that no Chinese were ever exempted from the blood test.","start":732.618,"stop":750.141,"duration":17.52},{"text":"Now this is the record which this Court is asked to review.","start":750.141,"stop":753.901,"duration":3.76},{"text":"Namely, whether or not, the blood tests were extended to white persons or whether or not the blood tests were confined and restricted to Chinese.","start":753.901,"stop":765.357,"duration":11.46},{"text":"On this posture of the record, it is submitted that Judge Dimock's finding that there was racial discrimination is imminently correct.","start":765.357,"stop":776.496,"duration":11.14},{"text":"Now, after the Government lost this case before Judge Dimock and after Judge Dimock had entered a judgement for the petitioners, the Government for the first time moved in a motion for reargument claiming on a basis of an ex parte affidavit that beginning in 1955, 60 white persons had been blood tested.","start":776.496,"stop":801.037,"duration":24.54},{"text":"Now, petitioners submit that the evidence of blood testing of white persons in 1955, the petitioners themselves being blood tested in 1952, the evidence of blood testing of white persons in 1955 if that be so does not absolve retroactively a discriminatory practice imposed upon Chinese in 1952.","start":801.037,"stop":827.191,"duration":26.15},{"text":"Moreover, the actual citation of the 60 white person blood tested in 1955 actually lend support to the proof of discrimination in this case because if there were reason to blood test 60 white persons in 1955, surely there were reason -- similar reasons existed for blood testing whites in 1952, in 1953 and 1954.","start":827.191,"stop":852.535,"duration":25.34},{"text":"And yet in all these years, despite the reasons for demanding a blood test, the Immigration Service could not show any examples of white persons blood tested in those years.","start":852.535,"stop":866.493,"duration":13.96},{"text":"Now, the Government argues in its brief that well beginning 1955, especially after Judge Dimock had condemned racial discrimination in blood testing Chinese beginning 1955, we reformed and there is no reason to exclude the discriminatory blood test in this case.","start":866.493,"stop":888.088,"duration":21.59},{"text":"Petitioners submit that the -- this case is controlled by the procedures in effect in 1952 and the subsequent repentance by the Government in blood testing white persons in 1955 does not retroactively cure any discrimination in blood testing Chinese in 1952.","start":888.088,"stop":912.159,"duration":24.07},{"text":"Now, it may be true that if -- as claimed by the Government that they have reformed and now the blood testing -- and if blood testing is now administered on a widespread basis, it maybe true perhaps that any Chinese hereafter may not claim discrimination but this case is controlled by the procedures and the practices of 1952 and the petitioners were entitled to be determined that -- were entitled to have a case determined on the procedures, the lawful procedures in effect of 1952.","start":912.159,"stop":948,"duration":35.84},{"text":"Now, at -- at this late stage, the Government has shifted its ground again and has advanced another justification.","start":948,"stop":956.979,"duration":8.98},{"text":"Now this justification comes in the form of a consular report -- it's apparently unclassified and the author of the report and the date of the report is not clear but this report purports to recite a high incidence of fraud among Chinese persons and the Government argues that from this report which is replete with dubious generalities and racial insinuations that blood testing is somewhat justified on a reasonable basis.","start":956.979,"stop":991.907,"duration":34.93},{"text":"Petitioners submit that this document was never submitted in the administrative hearings or before Judge Dimock.","start":991.907,"stop":999.499,"duration":7.59},{"text":"It is submitted in the first in this Court.","start":999.499,"stop":1001.966,"duration":2.47},{"text":"If the -- if this report had been submitted, petitioners wouldn't have been able to attack the conclusions and cross-examine the author or authors.","start":1001.966,"stop":1010.6,"duration":8.63},{"text":"The introduction of this report at this time is highly unfair and prejudicial and the petitioners have made a motion to strike this report from the records.","start":1010.6,"stop":1020.597,"duration":10},{"text":"Now petitioners submit that the only effective way of ensuring the constitutional rights -- kind of constitutional rights in this case is to exclude the evidence illegally obtained whereas Judge Learned Hand once observed that the exclusion of improper evidence is the only practical way the courts have of enforcing constitutional privilege.","start":1020.597,"stop":1044.17,"duration":23.57},{"text":"Now, petitioners submit and the Immigration Service concedes that eliminating the disputed and inaccurate blood test, all the
