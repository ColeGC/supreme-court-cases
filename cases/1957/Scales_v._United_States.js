Taylor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.","start":11.966,"stop":16.337,"duration":4.37},{"text":"This case comes up here from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.","start":16.337,"stop":20.67,"duration":4.33},{"text":"It's also a Smith Act case, but it is not a conspiracy case.","start":20.67,"stop":26.898,"duration":6.23},{"text":"And it comes up here under a provision of the Smith Act that has not hitherto then before this Court for review and consideration.","start":26.898,"stop":32.144,"duration":5.25},{"text":"Perhaps, the Court would like to look at it right at the outset and my brief in the appendix of page 48 sets forth the language of the Smith Act showing this clause and its context.","start":32.144,"stop":54.849,"duration":22.71},{"text":"The Court will recall that there are three basic paragraphs in the Smith Act, one prohibiting advocacy, one on the distribution of literature, and one on organizing groups.","start":54.849,"stop":68.87,"duration":14.02},{"text":"And the conspiracy cases that have hitherto come here have been for conspiracy to violate the first and third paragraphs on advocacy and organizing.","start":68.87,"stop":80.016,"duration":11.15},{"text":"The clause for this action that this case comes under is the last clause of the third paragraph.And eliminating the part about organizing, which is not relevant here.","start":80.016,"stop":90.904,"duration":10.89},{"text":"It reads, \"Whoever becomes or is a member of or affiliates with any such society, group or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof shall be fined, imprisoned and so forth.\"","start":90.904,"stop":105.91,"duration":15.01},{"text":"And to such group refers back to the same groups that the other provisions of the Act is concerned, group of persons who advocate the overthrow of the Government by force or violence.","start":105.91,"stop":118.298,"duration":12.39},{"text":"In short, this clause prescribes being a member of a group, the members of which advocate violent overthrow with knowledge that that is the purpose.","start":118.298,"stop":130.781,"duration":12.48},{"text":"Now, Your Honors, this case involves some of the same questions that you have heard discussed in the preceding cases, questions such as the sufficiency of the evidence about the Communist Party, the sufficiency of the evidence about an individual's connection with it.","start":130.781,"stop":154.279,"duration":23.5},{"text":"But the Court has heard considerable argument on these points.","start":154.279,"stop":158.209,"duration":3.93},{"text":"In the last two days, though not quite as much as I expected this morning when I came to Court, and for that reason it seems to me that it might be best for me to go immediately to the new questions in this case that are not presented in the prior cases because there are new constitutional and statutory problems arising here that I plan to focus my argument upon.","start":158.209,"stop":186.671,"duration":28.46},{"text":"There is the question of the constitutionality of this membership clause on its space and as applied in this case.","start":186.671,"stop":200.078,"duration":13.41},{"text":"The -- to state very briefly, the question of constitutionality arises because this contains no prohibition of advocacy or incitement or organizing or conspiring, this is a prohibition of status plus state of mind.","start":200.078,"stop":217.368,"duration":17.29},{"text":"Now the Court may not reach that question.","start":217.368,"stop":220.477,"duration":3.11},{"text":"The Court may not reach it because there is a statutory question here too, which maybe governing and the Court may prefer to approach constitutional questions last and not first as has been said.","start":220.477,"stop":233.633,"duration":13.16},{"text":"And that question is whether the indictment here states an offense against the laws of the United States.","start":233.633,"stop":241.158,"duration":7.52},{"text":"It arises because in 1950, 10 years after the Smith Act was passed, Congress enacted the Internal Security Act of 1950 including Section 4 (f) of that Act which you will find in the Appendix to my brief at page 49.","start":241.158,"stop":263.833,"duration":22.68},{"text":"Section 4 (f) declares that neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization, by any person, shall constitute per se a violation of subsection (a), or subsection (c) of this Section or of any other criminal statute.","start":263.833,"stop":289.127,"duration":25.29},{"text":"Now, that extension of the bar, whatever the bar is, to any other criminal statute, it is my argument that that presently bars the prosecution of Communists under the membership clause which is the clause that this case comes up under.","start":289.127,"stop":307.36,"duration":18.23},{"text":"Whatever might be its effect on conspiracy cases that has an effect on the membership clause is to cut off the prosecution for Communists.","start":307.36,"stop":317.335,"duration":9.97},{"text":"Now, after stating the case, I propose to focus my argument on these two questions, the statutory and the constitutional.","start":317.335,"stop":324.101,"duration":6.77},{"text":"There are also these evidentiary questions which are raised in Yates and -- and were raised in Mesarosh.","start":324.101,"stop":330.668,"duration":6.57},{"text":"And if time permits, I will say a few words about those as well as about the points relating to fair trial.","start":330.668,"stop":336.64,"duration":5.97}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"Can you take a minute to state the -- what you call statutory question.","start":336.64,"stop":341.261,"duration":4.62},{"text":"That isn't a question of criminal pleading, is it?","start":341.261,"stop":344.257,"duration":3}]},{"speakerName":"Telford Taylor","textObjs":[{"text":"No.","start":344.257,"stop":344.565,"duration":0.31},{"text":"It is a question of -- of limitation of the scope of -- of the Smith Act by virtue of a subsequent Act.","start":344.565,"stop":352.18,"duration":7.62},{"text":"It is not, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, a repeal of that, of the membership clause because the membership clause is left applicable to persons belonging to other organizations than a Communist Party, that is assuming it's constitutional.","start":352.18,"stop":368.094,"duration":15.91},{"text":"But it is in our -- in my view a limitation of the membership clause by the -- an exclusionary limitation, an exclusionary limitation of Communists.","start":368.094,"stop":377.857,"duration":9.76},{"text":"Now, might I say a preliminary word on the Government's past practice in the enforcement of this membership clause as compared to its enforcement of the other provisions of the Smith Act.","start":377.857,"stop":391.574,"duration":13.72},{"text":"As the Court knows, the Dennis case was the first case against Communists under the Smith Act.","start":391.574,"stop":399.529,"duration":7.95},{"text":"The defendants there were indicted not only in a single indictment for a conspiracy, but those defendants were also indicted in individual indictments under this same membership clause.","start":399.529,"stop":415.127,"duration":15.6},{"text":"But before the case was tried, there was a motion to sever those individual indictments under the membership clause.","start":415.127,"stop":423.824,"duration":8.7},{"text":"That motion is granted so that the Dennis defendants were tried only under the conspiracy indictment.","start":423.824,"stop":431.351,"duration":7.53},{"text":"However, those membership indictments have not been withdrawn, despite the lapse of eight years since 1948.","start":431.351,"stop":442.46,"duration":11.11},{"text":"Those membership indictments against the original Dennis defendants are still pending in the Southern District of New York, although there has never been any trial under those indictments.","start":442.46,"stop":455.58,"duration":13.12},{"text":"Now, after the Dennis case, the Government brought a series of conspiracy indictments similar to Dennis' indictment, similar to the cases that were here the last two days, against groups of Communist Party members and officers in various cities.","start":455.58,"stop":476.369,"duration":20.79},{"text":"Those cases, those indictments all were laid after 1950 and therefore, after the enactment of this provision from the Internal Security Act that I've just read.","start":476.369,"stop":489.848,"duration":13.48},{"text":"Whether or not that was the reason, I do not know, but the fact is that in those subsequent indictments, they did not undertake to indict the members individually under the membership clause.","start":489.848,"stop":501.203,"duration":11.35},{"text":"There's the Fraenkel case in Baltimore and the Flynn case in New York in which this Court denied certiorari.","start":501.203,"stop":507.374,"duration":6.17},{"text":"Then, this week, we have had the Yates and Mesarosh cases and none of those cases were there individual indictments under the membership clause.","start":507.374,"stop":517.274,"duration":9.9},{"text":"They were indicted only for conspiracy, and that insofar as I know remained true until 1954, 1954 was the first occasion.","start":517.274,"stop":529.065,"duration":11.79},{"text":"Since 1948 when those original membership indictments went in against the Dennis defendants, it was the first occasion that the Government again sought to invoke this membership clause and it sought it in this case, which is now before you, and in the Lightfoot case coming from the Seventh Circuit, which is on argument following this one.","start":529.065,"stop":549.37,"duration":20.3},{"text":"Only this case and the Lightfoot case under the membership clause have been reviewed in the Courts of Appeal.","start":549.37,"stop":555.865,"duration":6.5},{"text":"This one in the Fourth Circuit, Lightfoot in the Seventh, and in both of those cases, the conviction was affirmed and it was held that the Act was constitutional and that Section 4 (f) that I stressed is not a bar to prosecution.","start":555.865,"stop":573.25,"duration":17.38},{"text":"Now, may I turn to the facts of this case, which I can state quite briefly because basically the questions here are legal, I think.","start":573.25,"stop":581.294,"duration":8.04},{"text":"The petitioner, Scales, was indicted on November 18th in North Carolina, Federal District Court.","start":581.294,"stop":589.451,"duration":8.16},{"text":"The indictment is found on Page 1 of the record.","start":589.451,"stop":594.141,"duration":4.69},{"text":"And I think it is important to take a look at that, because much of the argument will revolve around what is in it and what is not in it.","start":594.141,"stop":603.936,"duration":9.8},{"text":"It is a very short and simple indictment entirely contained on that first page and it alleges four things.","start":603.936,"stop":612.576,"duration":8.64},{"text":"The first paragraph alleges that the Communist Party is a society or group of persons who teach and advocate the overthrow of Government.","start":612.576,"stop":623.413,"duration":10.84},{"text":"The petitioner undertook to deny that allegation.","start":623.413,"stop":627.952,"duration":4.54},{"text":"Then, in the next paragraph, it is first alleged that the petitioner, Scales is a member of the Communist Party, that he did not undertake to deny and the record shows that he is an officer of the Party at the state level.","start":627.952,"stop":644.849,"duration":16.9},{"text":"He is not a national officer.","start":644.849,"stop":647.294,"duration":2.44},{"text":"He is Chairman of the Party in North Carolina.","start":647.294,"stop":650.631,"duration":3.34},{"text":"On argument in the Yates case, government counsel analogized these cases by the number of stars the generals wore on their shoulder.","start":650.631,"stop":660.4,"duration":9.77},{"text":"I do not know how many stars would be warranted for this particular office, but apart from that, this is a state level case, nothing higher.","start":660.4,"stop":672.535,"duration":12.13},{"text":"Then, it is alleged that Scales knew the Communist Party to be a group that advocates overthrow by force or violence, and that is denied.","start":672.535,"stop":682.618,"duration":10.08},{"text":"Finally, the last allegation according to Page 1 is that the defendant intended to bring about overthrow, violent overthrow, as speedily as circumstances permit.","start":682.618,"stop":696.015,"duration":13.4},{"text":"That too is denied.","start":696.015,"stop":697.945,"duration":1.93},{"text":"There is a legal question as to whether that allegation has any proper place in the indictment, in view of the fact that the membership clause specifies that membership and knowledge says nothing about intent, and I will discuss that question in due course.","start":697.945,"stop":715.141,"duration":17.2},{"text":"The case went to trial in April of last year and Scales was found guilty.","start":715.141,"stop":721.352,"duration":6.21},{"text":"He got his six-year in jail much more easily than Mrs. Yates did.","start":721.352,"stop":726.684,"duration":5.33},{"text":"He did not take the stand, had no contempt problem, but he was given six years for this offense, which is in fact a year more than any other defendant in the Smith Act case has gotten.","start":726.684,"stop":738.97,"duration":12.29},{"text":"The reason for that is that the other defendants have been convicted under the general conspiracy statute, the maximum penalty underwhich until recently has been five -- the maximum penalty is five years.","start":738.97,"stop":750.783,"duration":11.81},{"text":"Whereas, since this case came up under the Smith Act itself where the maximum penalty is 10 years, he could be given a longer sentence and he was.","start":750.783,"stop":761.597,"duration":10.81},{"text":"The case was -- the conviction was affirmed below and the case came here on certiorari last March on four stated questions, of which I have already mentioned two, the constitutionality problem, the statutory problem under 4 (f) of the Internal Security Act, a question whether there is sufficient evidence of the Party's unlawful aims and sufficient evidence of Scales's guilty knowledge and intent.","start":761.597,"stop":787.299,"duration":25.7},{"text":"That is sufficient to go to the jury or support a verdict.","start":787.299,"stop":791.186,"duration":3.89},{"text":"And finally, there are four questions raised about the conduct of the trial of which probably the two most important are the method of impaneling the grand jury and the validity of certain rulings on the admissibility of evidence which Mr. Donner adverted to briefly this morning in discussing the questions which would be -- would have been presented under the Mesarosh case.","start":791.186,"stop":812.997,"duration":21.81}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Are there any questions as to the judge's charge?","start":812.997,"stop":817.126,"duration":4.13}]},{"speakerName":"Telford Taylor","textObjs":[{"text":"There are no questions raised on certiorari about the judge's charge.","start":817.126,"stop":823.301,"duration":6.18},{"text":"I think, Your Honor, probably has in mind the problem of incitement or may have that in mind which is discussed.","start":823.301,"stop":828.522,"duration":5.22},{"text":"There was in this case, unlike the Yates case the same kind of a charge about incitement that Judge Medina gave in the Dennis case.","start":828.522,"stop":839.976,"duration":11.45},{"text":"Now, might I say a few words about the evidence, which again I can do quite briefly.","start":839.976,"stop":844.978,"duration":5},{"text":"The prosecution called only three witnesses against Scales.","start":844.978,"stop":851.303,"duration":6.33},{"text":"The first one was Lautner, John Lautner, who is a chronic witness in these cases and he made exactly the same kind of testimony as far as I know that he has given in the others.","start":851.303,"stop":864.061,"duration":12.76},{"text":"He knew nothing about Scales, did not purport to know anything about petitioner.","start":864.061,"stop":868.269,"duration":4.21},{"text":"He testified as an ex-member of the Communist Party about the doctrinal aims of the Party from which incidentally he resigned on January 17th, 1950, which is nearly five years before this indictment was brought and about two years before the statutory period of limitations under this indictment.","start":868.269,"stop":891.326,"duration":23.06},{"text":"In general, he -- he identified the classical writings that were discussed yesterday with Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.","start":891.326,"stop":899.259,"duration":7.93},{"text":"He testified that the Communist Party of the United States where in its constitution or in other writings, it claims not to advocate force and violence.","start":899.259,"stop":910.479,"duration":11.22},{"text":"Lautner says in his opinion not as a camouflage.","start":910.479,"stop":914.424,"duration":3.94},{"text":"And he stated that Marxism-Leninism essentially means overthrow by force and violence.","start":914.424,"stop":921.822,"duration":7.4},{"text":"And that was in some substance of Lautner's testimony.","start":921.822,"stop":925.399,"duration":3.58},{"text":"The other two witnesses are the ones who testified about petitioner.","start":925.399,"stop":930.21,"duration":4.81},{"text":"They are both FBI informants who joined the Communist Party by prearrangement with the FBI to observe and report on what went on.","start":930.21,"stop":940.861,"duration":10.65},{"text":"The first being a witness named Clontz and he met Scales in 1948, which again is a long time before the indictment of statutory period and was in contact with Scales until December 1951, which is just barely the beginning of the statutory period.","start":940.861,"stop":961.595,"duration":20.73},{"text":"He testified primarily to numerous private conversations with Scales in which Scales has reported to have made statements upon which the Government relies heavily to show Scales' own personal belief in force and violence.","start":961.595,"stop":979.474,"duration":17.88},{"text":"Then, the third witness, Childs, another FBI informant, sort of picks up chronologically where Clontz stopped.","start":979.474,"stop":986.749,"duration":7.27},{"text":"He was in contact with Scales during the statutory period and attended a party school in North Carolina which it had said Scales was the director of.","start":986.749,"stop":998.511,"duration":11.76},{"text":"There is extensive testimony from Childs on what was taught of that school.","start":998.511,"stop":1003.878,"duration":5.37},{"text":"On the record of his testimony, much was taught there that it is certainly highly controversial, certainly highly abhorrent to many Americans.","start":1003.878,"stop":1010.218,"duration":6.34},{"text":"But as I read the record, there is no showing that force and violence was part of the school.","start":1010.218,"stop":1016.326,"duration":6.11},{"text":"That is the prosecutioner's case.","start":1016.326,"stop":1018.762,"duration":2.44},{"text":"As to the defense, the petitioner did not testify and the evidence given in his behalf, which I have described in my brief for the information of the Court, does not in my opinion importantly affect the issues that are now open here on certiorari, as to those issues.","start":1018.762,"stop":1040.061,"duration":21.3},{"text":"As I have remarked, the Court may not have to reach the constitutional question.","start":1040.061,"stop":1047.19,"duration":7.13},{"text":"But the constitutional and the statutory question, both depend on a careful reading of this membership clause to see what is in it and what isn't in it and I think it will be clearer if I tried to point out the constitutional issue first and then comes the statutory question.","start":1047.19,"stop":1066.686,"duration":19.5},{"text":"Although, Your Honors, may well decide to decide the case in reverse order.","start":1066.686,"stop":1071.792,"duration":5.11},{"text":"Now, on constitutionality.","start":1071.792,"stop":1074.488,"duration":2.7},{"text":"I would like the Court to consider just what the membership clause as applied in this indictment, seeks to imbue with a criminal seditious character.","start":1074.488,"stop":1089.291,"duration":14.8},{"text":"There is no charge in this case that the -- that Scales advocated violent overthrow or that he incited anybody to violent overthrow, or that he organized any group which was dedicated for the purpose of violent overthrow.","start":1089.291,"stop":1105.682,"duration":16.39},{"text":"There is no charge that he conspired with anyone to do any one of those things.","start":1105.682,"stop":1112.251,"duration":6.57},{"text":"There is in fact no act at all charged, unless remaining a member of the Party during the statutory period maybe considered an act.","start":1112.251,"stop":1123.31,"duration":11.06},{"text":"There is no concert of action, no agreement with anyone else charged in the indictment for any legal or illegal purpose.","start":1123.31,"stop":1134.601,"duration":11.29},{"text":"The defendants involved in the conspiracy cases that have just been before the Court, after all, are accused of being co-conspirators with the Dennis case defendants and they are the people who were supposed to have patched this conspiracy in 1945, and they are the leaders of the Party that is said to be the vehicle of the conspiracy.","start":1134.601,"stop":1159.023,"duration":24.42},{"text":"It is not my responsibility to say whether that accusation is -- is substantiated or not.","start":1159.023,"stop":1164.731,"duration":5.71},{"text":"However that may be, there is no such charge in this case, no charge of conspiracy with anyone.","start":1164.731,"stop":1174.707,"duration":9.98},{"text":"The difference, therefore, between this case and the Dennis case in terms of clear and present danger is I think not in need of elaboration.","start":1174.707,"stop":1186.397,"duration":11.69},{"text":"And actually, my argument with the Solicitor General is not joined on the basis of the membership clause as written, because as I read his brief, he does not undertake to defend the constitutionality of the membership clause as written.","start":1186.397,"stop":1204.82,"duration":18.42},{"text":"He undertakes to defend it by reading into that clause a great deal that is certainly not there in words and that I think cannot be read into it by any common sense implication.","start":1204.82,"stop":1217.4,"duration":12.58}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Taylor, I don't quite -- I'm not sure I
