jurisdiction.","start":170.963,"stop":191.871,"duration":20.91},{"text":"Therefore we think it's pretty, it's quite clear from the Congressional history that Congress specifically rejected the right

power.","start":208.297,"stop":231.91,"duration":23.61},{"text":"Therefore, necessarily the remedy provided by the National Labor Relations Act is in direct conflict with the remedy provided by the state court in this case.","start":231.91,"stop":243.579,"duration":11.67},{"text":"And therein as Mr. Justice Douglas asked about the Laburnum case yesterday, therein lies the distinction we believe

case.","start":296.358,"stop":316.145,"duration":19.79},{"text":"We do believe that the Laburnum case, if it were before the Court for decision again would probably be decided differently because the adjudication by the State Court in that case necessarily involves the adjudication of concerted -- of the right of employees to engage in concerted activity and the extent of the -- exercise of that right is a matter which has been given to the National Labor Relations Board.","start":316.145,"stop":345.204,"duration":29.06},{"text":"At any rate we think that the Laburnum case carries the, to the

Act.","start":345.204,"stop":366.865,"duration":21.66},{"text":"Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Weber case I think very clearly pointed out that it was necessary that the National Labor Relations Act

the Weber case instead of the Laburnum case that the Court would have decided it different.","start":366.865,"stop":398.273,"duration":31.41},{"text":"Well here there is a remedy provided.","start":398.273,"stop":403.878,"duration":5.6},{"text":"Secondly, we do not think that a mere allegation of violence in State Court pleadings gives to the state a hunting license to use any regulatory or take any regulatory measure, measures that if it sees fit or that its courts see fit or that a state court jury shall see fit.","start":403.878,"stop":439.733,"duration":35.86},{"text":"In other words a mere allegation in pleadings that violence is being committed doesn't open the door for the court -- for the state to take any action it sees fit upon the subject matter.","start":439.733,"stop":455.549,"duration":15.82},{"text":"To the contrary this Court has pointed out repeatedly that the Congress intended and I think the Congressional history shows it, that Congress intended that within the sphere of the National Labor Relations Board's authority Congress intended to leave only to the states, the exercise of the function to maintain public peace and order.","start":455.549,"stop":481.755,"duration":26.21},{"text":"The Congressional history shows that pretty clearly.","start":481.755,"stop":485.248,"duration":3.49},{"text":"Senator Taft said that only insofar as the actual violence in the commission was concerned did the two -- did the act overlap state remedies.","start":485.248,"stop":501.086,"duration":15.84},{"text":"So we don't think, we don't contend that the act replaces the state's injunction power or its authority to regulate -- to enforce its criminal statutes.","start":501.086,"stop":517.203,"duration":16.12},{"text":"But there is a limit within which that power of the state to maintain public peace and order in an emergency maybe exercised.","start":517.203,"stop":530.17,"duration":12.97},{"text":"The decision of the Court we think illustrate that only to the extent it is necessary to maintain public peace and order may the power be exercised.","start":530.17,"stop":544.89,"duration":14.72},{"text":"The power may not be exercised beyond what is necessary to accomplish that purpose and Mr. Justice Brennan asked about the Rainfair case, I think the Rainfair case illustrates that exactly.","start":544.89,"stop":558.401,"duration":13.51},{"text":"There the court, the state enjoined all picketing and the court very clearly know that only to the extent that it was necessary to control the injunction -- the violence did -- could the state exercise the injunctive remedy.","start":558.401,"stop":579.752,"duration":21.35},{"text":"In the (Inaudible) case the same case was, the same thing was true.","start":579.752,"stop":584.906,"duration":5.15},{"text":"That was an exercise of the police power of the state to maintain public peace and order.","start":584.906,"stop":594.211,"duration":9.31},{"text":"Now beyond the necessity of that exercise, the Congressional history indicates that Congress' original intention to maintain uniformity of regulation would be carried forward and getting back to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question of yesterday, which I'm afraid I misunderstood, with reference to the punitive damages, I understood him to ask as to whether we felt it was a federal question for -- here for the Court to decide whether those damages were excessive, but I'm advised that I misunderstood the question.","start":594.211,"stop":640.789,"duration":46.58},{"text":"The question at any rate I think possibly you asked if -- do we contend that whether or not the punitive damage feature raises a federal question, involves a federal question, we definitely do.","start":640.789,"stop":656.122,"duration":15.33},{"text":"The power to inflict enormous punitive damages is the power to prohibit, the power -- in a strike where several thousands workers are involved for instance, and say 200 suits of this character are
