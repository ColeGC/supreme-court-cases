certiorari.","start":399.948,"stop":404.464,"duration":4.52},{"text":"Now, for the first time in their reply brief, they come to face with the reality, namely the intensely practical fact that the amount that every person gets out of this fund on which the courts impressed the constructive trust.","start":404.464,"stop":426.184,"duration":21.72},{"text":"The -- everybody's claim is for more or fewer dollars depending upon the merits of the claim of every other individual who stopped was arbitrarily retired.","start":426.184,"stop":443.664,"duration":17.48},{"text":"For the first time, they have conceded in their reply brief that the actual, factual interdependence here makes it necessary to determine on the evidence as to each of these claims whether the individual parted with his stock through fraud and the amount of his claim.","start":443.664,"stop":466.734,"duration":23.07},{"text":"They concede in the part I've read to the Court that they -- you have to do that in order to

further.","start":476.783,"stop":479.283,"duration":2.5},{"text":"It means that after the Court has determined the precise amount of the unjust enrichment and determined exactly the amount that all the victims of this fraud are entitled to.","start":479.283,"stop":494.809,"duration":15.53},{"text":"That then, the Court can't distribute that unjust enrichment of which he's taking control, but he's got to the people that have been shown by this evidence that they say is necessary to be entitled to it.","start":494.809,"stop":506.062,"duration":11.25},{"text":"He can't distribute this fund of which he's taking control.","start":506.062,"stop":509.365,"duration":3.3},{"text":"But he's got to turn back to the trustee ex

shown to be due to the non-diverse interveners.","start":515.821,"stop":525.394,"duration":9.57},{"text":"Well now, in this case for example, what that means is that you've got to determine from the evidence of Mr. and Mrs. Constant whether they parted with their shares through fraud and how much they are entitled to.","start":525.394,"stop":541.581,"duration":16.19},{"text":"You've got to do that, they say, in order to determine what the plaintiff is entitled to, but after you have determined what the Constants are entitled to, then they say, \"The Court must turn them out of court because they're non-diverse and it can't give them their established part of this fund.","start":541.581,"stop":560.921,"duration":19.34},{"text":"Professor (Inaudible), one time, characterized the type of cases in which federal courts exercise ancillary jurisdiction over non-diverse people.","start":560.921,"stop":575.454,"duration":14.53},{"text":"I say in that non-diverse people are permitted to come in order to dispose of the property of which the Court has taken jurisdiction.","start":575.454,"stop":586.46,"duration":11.01},{"text":"And that he says it's like dividing up a pie.","start":586.46,"stop":590.625,"duration":4.16},{"text":"He says you've got to count the people around the table.","start":590.625,"stop":594.501,"duration":3.88},{"text":"You've got to know who's there before you cut the pie, before you know how many pieces there are.","start":594.501,"stop":600.625,"duration":6.12},{"text":"Well, my friend on the other side goes partway.","start":600.625,"stop":605.581,"duration":4.96},{"text":"They -- they have to count the Constants.","start":605.581,"stop":608.03,"duration":2.45},{"text":"They have to count the people.","start":608.03,"stop":609.368,"duration":1.34},{"text":"They have to find out about it.","start":609.368,"stop":611.919,"duration":2.55},{"text":"But after the pie has been cut, then the Constants are turned away from the table, they are not permitted to get their pieces of the pie.","start":611.919,"stop":620.781,"duration":8.86},{"text":"But those pieces of the pie are turned back to the fraud feasor out of this property of which the Court has taken jurisdiction.","start":620.781,"stop":630.747,"duration":9.97},{"text":"Now, we submit that what this contention adds up to is a brand new contention in this lawsuit that federal courts just don't have after all -- federal courts don't have the jurisdiction they have exercised from the beginning of the Court to deal with non-diverse interveners in order to adjudicate interdependent rights to property on which the Court has impressed a constructive trust.","start":630.747,"stop":667.447,"duration":36.7},{"text":"The petition here was aimed primarily and naturally so at the substantive judgment alone, the judgment holding Black guilty of fraud and require him account for his unjust enrichment.","start":667.447,"stop":685.246,"duration":17.8},{"text":"But the Court denied certiorari on the merits of that substantive judgment and left Black only with this narrow jurisdictional point.","start":685.246,"stop":698.796,"duration":13.55},{"text":"The jurisdictional point is so self-limiting that Black has found that an extremely poor substitute for the review on the merits which he sought.","start":698.796,"stop":712.522,"duration":13.73},{"text":"The jurisdictional point involving the Constants is a self-limiting point because the very heart of the contention on which it rest is that the claims of the Constants are wholly separate and distinct from those of every other party.","start":712.522,"stop":736.036,"duration":23.51},{"text":"So, if we accept completely here and I think my friend on the other side conceded this in a question from Justice Black or Justice Douglas, its -- if we accept fully the proposition that the Court's question was correctly posed on the facts which we say it was.","start":736.036,"stop":760.462,"duration":24.43},{"text":"And if we concede arguendo that non-diverse parties should not be permitted in this case, concede everything that petitioner is entitled to argue under the limited grant of certiorari that we have here.","start":760.462,"stop":780.96,"duration":20.5},{"text":"What we come to is the proposition, that two parties, the Constants were non-diverse, were permitted to intervene here and ought to be dismissed out of this case without questions.","start":780.96,"stop":793.191,"duration":12.23},{"text":"Well now, that would be most unfortunate for the Constants.","start":793.191,"stop":799.248,"duration":6.06},{"text":"We've devoted our entire defense here substantially to showing that it would be an unjust and improper result.","start":799.248,"stop":809.682,"duration":10.43},{"text":"But at the same time, its very poor comfort for Mr. Black, and so he asks an opportunity to perform a very delicate operation which he didn't really elaborate here in argument as he did in his brief.","start":809.682,"stop":830.041,"duration":20.36},{"text":"The judgment against the Constants would -- the dropping out of the Constants would reduce the judgment only insignificant.","start":830.041,"stop":839.267,"duration":9.23},{"text":"And so Black has deemed it to be utterly essential to find some basis on which he could defeat the participation of the other plaintiffs as well as the Constants.","start":839.267,"stop":850.055,"duration":10.79},{"text":"And since the majority of the other parties are residents of Illinois, the expedient which he has adopted is an effort to destroy the diversity of the Illinois people.","start":850.055,"stop":865.976,"duration":15.92},{"text":"And here's where the delicate operation comes in.","start":865.976,"stop":870.499,"duration":4.52},{"text":"He sees as his vehicle on Black Marshall Oil Corporation.","start":870.499,"stop":877.392,"duration":6.89},{"text":"He wants the Black Marshall Oil Company to be held to be a necessary party in order to destroy the diversity that exist between
