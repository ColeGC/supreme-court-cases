Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question as to the legality of a dual rate formula used by a single carrier, let me refer to the first case arising before the Shipping Board as to dual rate.","start":7.33,"stop":27.937,"duration":20.61},{"text":"In 1922, the Eden Mining Company case which is cited and quoted and discussed starting at page 51 of the government's brief.","start":27.937,"stop":39.655,"duration":11.72},{"text":"That case arose and was decided by the Board not under Section 14, since Section 14 was not involved.","start":39.655,"stop":50.252,"duration":10.6},{"text":"That's a collective retaliation section but under Section 16 and 17.","start":50.252,"stop":56.16,"duration":5.91},{"text":"And the Board found that a dual rate formula, when used by a single carrier, is illegal.","start":56.16,"stop":63.634,"duration":7.47},{"text":"And the Board said that it is evident that the purpose of Congress in enacting these provisions of the statute was to impose upon common carriers within the purview thereof, the duty of charging uniform rates to all shippers we've seen in a similar transportation service.","start":63.634,"stop":80.1,"duration":16.47},{"text":"The Board went on to refer the leading I.C.C. case, the Western Union Telegraphic Company case, 181 U.S., reading from the bottom of the page, but that principle of equality does forbid any difference in charge which is not based on difference in service and even when based upon difference of service must have some reasonable relation to the amount of difference.","start":80.1,"stop":102.89,"duration":22.79},{"text":"Now, we have undertaken to meet the argument on the other side that there's been a consistent administrative construction of the Board here.","start":102.89,"stop":110.702,"duration":7.81},{"text":"The dual rate system is perfectly all right by showing as Judge Frank pointed out in his opinion for the three-judge District Court in the North Atlantic case.","start":110.702,"stop":120.103,"duration":9.4},{"text":"But the Board -- the Board which really of course represents four successive agencies.","start":120.103,"stop":125.447,"duration":5.34},{"text":"First, the Shipping Board then the Secretary of Commerce then the Maritime Commission and now the Federal Maritime Board.","start":125.447,"stop":130.773,"duration":5.33},{"text":"Their decisions of every -- have gone every which way on this and it wasn't really until 1933, 17 years after the Shipping Act, you

case.","start":156.912,"stop":158.24,"duration":1.33},{"text":"That -- that is 1933, 17 years after the Act, far from a contemporaneous interpretation, inconsistent with the Eden case which I've mentioned.","start":158.24,"stop":168.576,"duration":10.34},{"text":"Now, I have -- I said at the outset that we -- we regard the order of the Board here which is under a -- which is what's on the

standard.","start":181.905,"stop":184.853,"duration":2.95},{"text":"The Board here conceded that the dual rate system was discriminatory, that it was monopolistic, conceded that it was -- its purpose was anti-competitive to eliminate an independent -- from business or to join a con -- conference.","start":184.853,"stop":199.783,"duration":14.93},{"text":"The Board nevertheless said, those -- that discrimination, that monopolistic feature is outweighed by the fact that it produces rate stability.","start":199.783,"stop":211.067,"duration":11.28},{"text":"It eliminates competition among carriers as to rates and stability of rate is a good thing and it's a justification.","start":211.067,"stop":218.651,"duration":7.58},{"text":"Now, we find on our reading of the statute and our reading of the committee report that while Congress was concerned with rate stability and was anxious to maintain rate stability.","start":218.651,"stop":232.773,"duration":14.12},{"text":"It didn't make an absolute dogma of rate stability.","start":232.773,"stop":235.562,"duration":2.79},{"text":"It permitted the Board in considering whether to approve conference agreements under Section 15, to consider whether such an agreement would be desirable, would produce stability.","start":235.562,"stop":249.747,"duration":14.19},{"text":"But that was an agreement among the carriers themselves as to what each one of them was charged.","start":249.747,"stop":256.636,"duration":6.89},{"text":"And -- and Congress has said “Yes, the Board has the power to permit this car -- conference carriers to form an association

extent.”","start":269.264,"stop":271.786,"duration":2.52},{"text":"But Congress didn't stop with Section 15.","start":271.786,"stop":276.23,"duration":4.44},{"text":"Congress put in the statute, Section 14 and Section 16 and 17 -- 16 and 17 which are on -- in the appendix to our brief 60 -- pages 65 and 66, those provisions are taken from the Interstate Commerce Act.","start":276.23,"stop":291.739,"duration":15.51},{"text":"As this Court pointed out in the Cunard case and the Swayne & Hoyt case.","start":291.739,"stop":295.853,"duration":4.11},{"text":"Congress permitted the Board to suspend pro tanto the antitrust laws to the extent that it could approve these conference agreements fixing rates among themselves.","start":295.853,"stop":309.139,"duration":13.29},{"text":"But congress went further.","start":309.139,"stop":310.977,"duration":1.84},{"text":"It subjected these conferences to the -- the restrictions of the Interstate Commerce Act.","start":310.977,"stop":317.28,"duration":6.3},{"text":"That was done in 16 and 17, 16 and 17 says that there shall be no discrimination between shippers, that's the consequence of dual rate system.","start":317.28,"stop":325.191,"duration":7.91},{"text":"But specifically, Congress didn't even stop with 16 and 17, Congress put in Section 14.","start":325.191,"stop":332.051,"duration":6.86},{"text":"Section 14 is cashed in terms of outright prohibitions.","start":332.051,"stop":336.291,"duration":4.24},{"text":"It prohibits in Section first the deferred rate -- rebate system.","start":336.291,"stop":340.914,"duration":4.62},{"text":"Now, the deferred rebate system was the system which was then widely used prior to 1916.","start":340.914,"stop":347.68,"duration":6.77},{"text":"That was the system for eliminating competition.","start":347.68,"stop":350.279,"duration":2.6},{"text":"That was the system for producing rate stability.","start":350.279,"stop":353.426,"duration":3.15},{"text":"That was the system that would prevent rate wars to the extent that it was effective, you have a complete destruction, elimination of independent competition.","start":353.426,"stop":361.886,"duration":8.46},{"text":"Congress said “No, you --” to the Board, “you can't approve that because in Section 15 the grant of power to the Board to approve conference agreements is specifically limited.”","start":361.886,"stop":371.543,"duration":9.66},{"text":"The Board is given no power to approve any agreement which is that it -- which is unjustly discriminatory unfair as between carriers which operates the detrimental commerce of the United States or in violation of this Act.","start":371.543,"stop":385.763,"duration":14.22},{"text":"And to find out whether it's in violation of the Act, you look to the whole Act.","start":385.763,"stop":388.8,"duration":3.04},{"text":"Not just Section 15, you look at 14 as well as 16 and 17.","start":388.8,"stop":392.924,"duration":4.12},{"text":"And if a -- if an agreement is in violation of Section 14, the Board has no power to approve it.","start":392.924,"stop":398.159,"duration":5.24},{"text":"Now, Section 14, Second -- prohibits a fighting ship, again a fighting ship is a device to deal with competition of independence.","start":398.159,"stop":406.853,"duration":8.69},{"text":"It produces rate stability.","start":406.853,"stop":408.886,"duration":2.03},{"text":"But certainly, if the Federal Maritime Board could not enter an order today saying that a fighting ship or a deferred rebate or the specific restraint mentioned in 14 Third, a refusal or a threat -- or a threat of refuse of space accommodations, suppose it -- suppose a conference came to the Board and offered to setup a system providing further deferred rebate, fighting ship or refusal of space accommodation.","start":408.886,"stop":435.306,"duration":26.42},{"text":"Could the Board use as the standard of law under Section 14, the proposition?","start":435.306,"stop":440.627,"duration":5.32},{"text":"Well, this will produce rate stability and we think that in this industry, competition isn't a good thing and therefore we will permit it.","start":440.627,"stop":449.318,"duration":8.69},{"text":"The answer is Section 14 precludes the Board from taking in to consideration that standard.","start":449.318,"stop":455.596,"duration":6.28},{"text":"It's a standard for approving agreements among the conference -- conference carriers themselves.","start":455.596,"stop":461.123,"duration":5.53},{"text":"They can fix rates among each other but they can't -- they can't agree also that they will go after an independent carrier who wishes to stay outside the conference and drive them in to the conference or drive them out of business.","start":461.123,"stop":476.892,"duration":15.77},{"text":"Now, Section 14 Third which has been the main provision in this case, prohibits retaliation against any shipper by refusing or threatening to refuse space accommodation when such are available, specific or resort to other discriminating or unfair methods.","start":476.892,"stop":496.926,"duration":20.03},{"text":"Now, Congress specifically outlawed these three things that were unused -- used then, but it didn't stop there, it flatly, sweepingly then every discriminating or unfair method which was used because such shipper has patronized any other carrier or has filed a complaint charging unfair treatment or for any other reason.","start":496.926,"stop":518.486,"duration":21.56},{"text":"So you have two catchall clauses here.","start":518.486,"stop":521.183,"duration":2.7},{"text":"You've got a catchall clause condemning every method which is unfair and discriminating which is used to retaliate against the shippers who reserve the right to patronize carriers and retaliation is not merely for patronizing another carrier but for any other reason.","start":521.183,"stop":541.164,"duration":19.98},{"text":"Now, the Board has construed Section 14 and that -- and these errors of law light the very threshold of it's -- of its report.","start":541.164,"stop":548.584,"duration":7.42},{"text":"The Board has construed Section 14 as if these two catchall clauses weren't in there at all.","start":548.584,"stop":553.624,"duration":5.04},{"text":"I refer specifically to page 52 of its report where the Board said -- after referring to the Swayne & Hoyt case and to the legislative material, Mr. Gardner has referred to.","start":553.624,"stop":569.747,"duration":16.12},{"text":"The Board says in -- in support of the view that Congress intended in the Act to prohibit only those practices specifically condemned, we offer the following testimony of a witness on another bill which did not become a Shipping Act.","start":569.747,"stop":584.791,"duration":15.04},{"text":"The --

carrier.","start":622.206,"stop":632.622,"duration":10.42},{"text":"It is charged because the shipper does not sign the contract regardless of whether or not he patronizes any other
