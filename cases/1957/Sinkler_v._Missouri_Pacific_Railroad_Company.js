versus B&O, the Court saw as a matter of dicta this -- this point which I'm making here, because in the opinion of that case, after holding that the Pullman porter was not an employee and was not entitled to sue under the Act, it went on to say it would be absurd that the question is not whether the railroad company by virtue of its duty to passengers of which it cannot divest itself by any arrangement with the sleeping car company would not be liable for the negligence of a sleeping car porter in matters involving the passenger's safety.","start":758.71,"stop":799.029,"duration":40.32},{"text":"In other words, the sleeping car porter could not sue the railroad as its employee under the Act, but nevertheless, the railroad might
