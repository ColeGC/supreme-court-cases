commenced in Connecticut, where he was residing when he was apprehended.","start":166.346,"stop":174.574,"duration":8.23},{"text":"The District Judge held that if -- if this man had committed an offense, it was completed when the ship sails and that it was a single offense, which was done at that time and therefore, he was not in violation of the law while he was residing in Connecticut.","start":174.574,"stop":197.647,"duration":23.07},{"text":"And for this reason, it dismissed the information.","start":197.647,"stop":200.671,"duration":3.02},{"text":"The Government

the offense with which this appellee was charged was a continuing offense, which was in the process of being committed when he lived in Connecticut, whether it was a non-continuing offense which was completed when the ship sailed.","start":224.267,"stop":252.365,"duration":28.1},{"text":"First, I think we should look at the definition of the offense as it contained -- as it is contained in the

misdemeanor.”","start":262.725,"stop":282.148,"duration":19.42},{"text":"The important words from our point of view were, “any alien crewman who willfully remains in the United States in excess of the number of days allowed”.","start":282.148,"stop":295.527,"duration":13.38},{"text":"On the facts of this particular case, there are three geographic localities where it is possible that someone might claim that there was venue.","start":295.527,"stop":307.686,"duration":12.16},{"text":"First is Philadelphia, the city where the vessel put in and from which it sailed.","start":307.686,"stop":316.686,"duration":9},{"text":"It would really make little sense to require trial to be held in Philadelphia because the seaman is not in fact required to sail from Philadelphia by the law.","start":316.686,"stop":330.61,"duration":13.92},{"text":"As long as he -- the law reads, for the period permitted by the -- by the permit, as long as he leaves the United States within that period of time, whether he leaves from Philadelphia or somewhere else, he is not in violation of the law","start":330.61,"stop":345.586,"duration":14.98},{"text":".In fact, many landing permits contemplate that the seaman will leave from another port on another vessel and many of the landing permits therefore would have nothing to do with the original -- the original port of entry.","start":345.586,"stop":361.522,"duration":15.94},{"text":"Now, the second locality, where venue might be asserted is the place where the crewman was physically at the time the permit expired.","start":361.522,"stop":374.675,"duration":13.15},{"text":"This of course depends in part on chance.","start":374.675,"stop":378.906,"duration":4.23},{"text":"He might in fact be in -- in

measured by the time that the vessel remained in port, he might not even know of this precise time that the vessel departed and therefore, he would not know at what time he was actually violating the law.","start":385.704,"stop":403.516,"duration":17.81},{"text":"Now, the third possible place to pick the venue is the place or the places where the -- where the alien crewman resides -- remains after the period of time which it permitted by his landing permit.","start":403.516,"stop":425.621,"duration":22.1},{"text":"We believe that establishing venue in this place coincides with the language of the statute, that it coincides with the nature of the crime which is involved and that imposes no hardship on the -- on the alien involved.","start":425.621,"stop":443.254,"duration":17.63}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What would you do with him if he was a

don't mean to use residence in any two technical term.","start":470.068,"stop":472.956,"duration":2.89},{"text":"I mean, he must willfully be staying in a place and rather than merely passing through

of the statute as I pointed out a minute ago is that he willfully remains in the United States in excess of the number of days allowed.","start":485.312,"stop":494.732,"duration":9.42},{"text":"It does not say that the alien must leave at or before the termination of his -- of his permit.","start":494.732,"stop":501.698,"duration":6.97},{"text":"It uses the word remain and that word in itself has a -- has a sense of continuation.","start":501.698,"stop":509.807,"duration":8.11},{"text":"It can be defined as, if he continued to stay in the United States.","start":509.807,"stop":515.211,"duration":5.4},{"text":"And that is why I say that on the language, just purely on the language of the statute, this man was remaining in the United States at the time he was apprehended in Connecticut.","start":515.211,"stop":526.949,"duration":11.74},{"text":"Now, as to the nature of the offense, here, there is no objection to the alien's entry.","start":526.949,"stop":536.226,"duration":9.28},{"text":"There was nothing illegal about it.","start":536.226,"stop":538.189,"duration":1.96},{"text":"He has committed no crime outside of

of his past, which makes him ineligible to remain in this country.","start":547.324,"stop":554.42,"duration":7.1},{"text":"Instead, the only -- the only thing that Congress was -- was getting at in this case was an alien who stayed, who remained in the country longer than he was permitted to, remained by the -- by the immigration law.","start":554.42,"stop":570.273,"duration":15.85},{"text":"This law was passed by Congress after an investigation, in which it was determined that every year, thousands of alien seamen were attempting to loose themselves in the population of the United States and obtain a right to stay here by -- not a right to stay here but obtaining the actual staying here by losing themselves in the -- in the general population.","start":570.273,"stop":594.965,"duration":24.69},{"text":"Congress wasn't concerned really with a man who overstayed his leave by days, hours, or minutes.","start":594.965,"stop":603.064,"duration":8.1},{"text":"It was concerned with seamen who were using their entry into the United States as seamen as a method of acquiring illegal residence here and therefore, I say that the very nature of the crime, which Congress was attacking was that very thing which this appellee was doing in Connecticut at the time he was apprehended.","start":603.064,"stop":628.185,"duration":25.12},{"text":"Now, since the constitutional provisions on -- on venue, without a doubt intended to protect defendants from the hardships of

place.","start":647.308,"stop":661.55,"duration":14.24},{"text":"And we should consider whether or not the construction, which I suggest is one which will constitute the kind of hardship which the

might be taken as more or less characteristic of this case.","start":673.26,"stop":681.096,"duration":7.84},{"text":"He could have been tried in Philadelphia of -- that's one possibility as to where a venue could be asserted.","start":681.096,"stop":689.001,"duration":7.9},{"text":"That certainly would not be a place which would be -- which we have any reason to believe -- to believe would be convenient to the seaman.","start":689.001,"stop":696.028,"duration":7.03},{"text":"So far as we would know, he hasn't been in -- in Philadelphia since the day he landed in -- in the -- in the

is.","start":2503.214,"stop":2509.931,"duration":6.72},{"text":"We submit that every relevant indication of congressional intent indicates that Congress meant secretary -- Section 1282 (c) to describe

found.","start":2509.931,"stop":2531.121,"duration":21.19},{"text":"Now, we submit that it finally comes out, what they want to do is try this man, Cores, and other similarly situated where

remaining.","start":2551.933,"stop":2570.59,"duration":18.66},{"text":"Now, someone might ask, when the crime of remaining could have been so simply made a continuing offense, all Congress had to do

offense”.","start":2570.59,"stop":2596.145,"duration":25.55},{"text":"When they so easily could have done it, why did not Congress make this crime of remaining a continuing
