removal of subsection (h) from Section 2 that our opponents do.","start":885.115,"stop":896.561,"duration":11.45},{"text":"We feel and I think it is fairly clear again from the debates which I won't

2.","start":896.561,"stop":920.195,"duration":23.63},{"text":"And Senator Borah in offering his amendment as a criminal section said there are certain practices which should be forbidden as a matter

on which there might be some questions, but he characterized these practices which were prescribed by Section 3 as fraudulent practices.","start":933.371,"stop":951.651,"duration":18.28},{"text":"So, Senator Borah attached his amendment to the Robinson bill.","start":951.651,"stop":959.794,"duration":8.14},{"text":"At the hearings in the Senate, many witnesses expressed a preference for the Borah-Van Nuys bill over the Robinson bill.","start":959.794,"stop":969.398,"duration":9.6},{"text":"Representative Healy of Massachusetts introduced the Borah-Van Nuys provision into the House as a substitute for the entire Patman bill.","start":969.398,"stop":983.344,"duration":13.95},{"text":"And again, throughout the discussion, the Senators and Representatives stated time and time again the objectives of all these bills are the same to correct and improve the Clayton Act and although they may differ as to detail, they are entirely uniformed as to purpose.","start":983.344,"stop":1011.625,"duration":28.28},{"text":"Now, I think that the codifiers recognized this purpose when Section 3 was codified as one of the antitrust laws.","start":1011.625,"stop":1025.079,"duration":13.45},{"text":"Again, our opponents characterized this as an error.","start":1025.079,"stop":1029.692,"duration":4.61},{"text":"We -- we feel that it was done on purpose because the codification in its terms was changed in the 1940 code to reflect the passage of the Robinson-Patman Act and it was deliberately -- the Section 3 was deliberately retained as an anti-trust law as defined in Section 1 by the code.","start":1029.692,"stop":1057.568,"duration":27.88},{"text":"Now, we maintain that that constitutes an administrative interpretation
