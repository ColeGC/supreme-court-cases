State allows.","start":148.525,"stop":159.62,"duration":11.1},{"text":"The way that it works in Idaho, particularly with respect to this waiver program, is that the providers provide the service to the beneficiary, the providers then bill the State, and the State reimburses them.","start":159.62,"stop":171.94,"duration":12.32},{"text":"And both under Federal regulations and State regulations,

might go to the -- to the merits there.","start":258.335,"stop":261.79,"duration":3.46},{"text":"But what we would say is that you look at the statute first, and the statute doesn't entitle them to anything.","start":261.79,"stop":267.3,"duration":5.51},{"text":"And that, sort of like in -- in determining whether a plaintiff has a Section 1983 right or whether a plaintiff has standing, for
