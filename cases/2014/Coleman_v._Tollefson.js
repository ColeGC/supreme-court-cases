In our view, the critical phrase in the statute is the phrase \"prior occasion.\" And to be sure, an occasion is triggered at the point at which a dismissal is entered.

So in a case in which a district court enters a qualifying dismissal, that is to say, a dismissal on the ground that the action is frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim, the occasion is complete only when the appellate process runs its course.","start":154.23,"stop":186.84,"duration":32.61},{"text":"And so, too, when the court of appeals, if it enters a qualifying dismissal on those similar grounds, a separate occasion is initiated by the dismissal and it, too, ends when further review is complete.","start":186.84,"stop":199.34,"duration":12.5}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Why do you say that?

For one thing, we think that it is notable that the statute does not provide that a mere affirmance of a district court dismissal qualifies as a distinct strike. So, in other words, in a case in which a district court dismisses on one of the specified grounds and then the court of appeals simply affirms, I think everyone would agree that there is only one strike.","start":228.9,"stop":256.97,"duration":28.07},{"text":"And in our in view --","start":256.97,"stop":257.6,"duration":0.63}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Shanmugam, would you explain that distinction from the court of appeals level? So the district court dismisses for failure to state a claim.","start":257.6,"stop":266.21,"duration":8.61},{"text":"It goes up to the court of appeals. When would the court of appeals simply affirm and when would it say \"appeal dismissed\"?","start":266.21,"stop":277.69,"duration":11.48}]},{"speakerName":"Kannon K.

To come at it from another direction, the circumstances in which courts of appeals dismiss appeals rather than affirming are circumstances in which the appeal itself is frivolous or malicious.","start":287.525,"stop":313.17,"duration":25.65},{"text":"So in a circumstance in which a court of appeals merely affirms, there is no discrete strike at the court of appeals level.
