the SEC in fact has somewhat broader power than Ms. Saharsky suggests because, while it is true that the SEC stop order power under Section 8(d) uses similar language, the SEC also has the power to

respect.","start":3476.329,"stop":3496.809,"duration":20.48},{"text":"In our view, that is broader language that would give the SEC somewhat more expansive authority if it believed that a statement of

circumstances.","start":3553.659,"stop":3576.422,"duration":22.76},{"text":"And as Mr. Goldstein said, this inquiry would be very context specific, and again in a context where issuers really require
