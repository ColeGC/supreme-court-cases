the State's justifications matter, it's no more difficult to analyze a justification that has to do with another tax of any other justification.","start":3159.653,"stop":3170.194,"duration":10.54},{"text":"As a matter of fact, it's a lot easier because you can just use math as opposed to evaluating some other justification.","start":3170.194,"stop":3174.513,"duration":4.32},{"text":"And the justification with respect to the truckers is that we are obligated under a series of interstate agreements, international agreements and Federal law, to impose a per-gallon tax on the truckers.","start":3174.513,"stop":3184.22,"duration":9.71},{"text":"And then once you impose that tax on the truckers, the question arises should you also impose an additional sales tax on the same transaction as the purchase of diesel fuel.","start":3184.22,"stop":3192.64,"duration":8.42},{"text":"And it makes perfect sense for the State to say, as a policy matter, that we're not going to double tax the same transaction.","start":3192.64,"stop":3197.794,"duration":5.15},{"text":"It was surprising to hear my friend talk about how he would be fine if the State tried to treat railroads in a way that was the same as truckers, because that's exactly what the State of Tennessee did and it found itself in a real quandary that this Court needs to prevent.","start":3197.794,"stop":3211.621,"duration":13.83},{"text":"Which is the railroads were arguing that Tennessee was discriminating against them because the railroads weren't treated like truckers.","start":3211.621,"stop":3217.008,"duration":5.39},{"text":"They won that litigation.","start":3217.008,"stop":3218.525,"duration":1.52},{"text":"And then -- so Tennessee turned around and tried to craft a statute that treated railroads exactly the same way as truckers.","start":3218.525,"stop":3223.245,"duration":4.72},{"text":"And then the railroad sued again saying that they were being targeted or singled out for a tax that no one else had to pay.","start":3223.245,"stop":3228.313,"duration":5.07},{"text":"And I think that is a necessary implication of the rule that my friend on the other side is adopting which is that it is -- it is discrimination to treat railroads unlike anyone that they particularly say that they compete with and it's also discrimination to try to avoid that discrimination.","start":3228.313,"stop":3242.14,"duration":13.83},{"text":"And the other point I would make is that we're not talking in this case about a tax on diesel fuel.","start":3242.14,"stop":3247.961,"duration":5.82},{"text":"We're talking about a sales tax.","start":3247.961,"stop":3249.813,"duration":1.85},{"text":"When CSX sends us a check for their taxes, there is one line and it says sales tax.","start":3249.813,"stop":3255.9,"duration":6.09},{"text":"This is how much we pay to the State basis on sales tax.","start":3255.9,"stop":3259.102,"duration":3.2},{"text":"And everybody else, all the other businesses in the State that have to pay the sales tax on the items that they need for their businesses, are sending us the same check that says this is what we have to pay on sales tax.","start":3259.102,"stop":3270.326,"duration":11.22},{"text":"And with respect to diesel specifically, manufacturing companies, timber companies, construction companies, when they send us a check, they -- they say sales tax and that includes everything else that they have to pay on the sales tax and the diesel fuel.","start":3270.326,"stop":3283.567,"duration":13.24},{"text":"And that money that we're using, that we're collecting by the sales tax, goes to -- primarily for education, which is something that the railroads benefit from just like everyone else in the State.","start":3283.567,"stop":3293.342,"duration":9.78},{"text":"But ultimately what we're asking the Court to do is adopt a rule that if we are using the -- the hand-picked class of competitors, that the courts actually have to weigh a State's reasons for the exemptions in its tax code and with a focus on whether the railroads are suffering any practical disadvantage.","start":3293.342,"stop":3308.351,"duration":15.01},{"text":"And that's what the Eleventh Circuit refused to do.","start":3308.351,"stop":3310.567,"duration":2.22},{"text":"That's ultimately what the district court did do.","start":3310.567,"stop":3313.086,"duration":2.52},{"text":"And I think I disagree with my friend on the other side about the burden of proof in this case.","start":3313.086,"stop":3316.538,"duration":3.45},{"text":"It's always going to be the railroad's burden of proof to show discrimination.","start":3316.538,"stop":3320.075,"duration":3.54},{"text":"And I think the district court applied exactly the right formula for determining that.","start":3320.075,"stop":3324.377,"duration":4.3},{"text":"Which is -- which is if you're in the zone where you're using the railroads' competitors as a comparison class, then you're in that area because you're worried about whether they're suffering some practical disadvantage vis-a-vis their competitors.","start":3324.377,"stop":3334.919,"duration":10.54},{"text":"And so it makes sense only to strike down a tax if they actually are suffering some real world practical disadvantage and that's something that they never showed in this case.","start":3334.919,"stop":3346.14,"duration":11.22},{"text":"Ultimately, what the Court should do is it should put itself in the position of a state and local policy maker who is trying to impose

pay.","start":3363.102,"stop":3380.964,"duration":17.86},{"text":"And that is that you can use a comparison class of general other businesses with a focus on whether railroads are being singled out or
