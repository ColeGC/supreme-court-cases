word of many meanings, too many meanings, and has tried to distinguish jurisdiction, meaning subject matter or personal, from the rules, once a case fits jurisdiction, how it will be processed in the Court.","start":51.016,"stop":78.849,"duration":27.83},{"text":"And it seems to me a time limitation, even a very stringent time limitation, is not

that.","start":88.539,"stop":93.193,"duration":4.65},{"text":"First of all, I think that when Congress acted in 1946 and it transplanted the -- the identical words of the statute that -- of the Tucker Act -- the statute governing Tucker Act claims, Congress understood itself to be incorporating the same settled meaning, and those words had already been given a jurisdictional meaning by this Court.","start":93.193,"stop":110.904,"duration":17.71}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Jurisdictional in the narrow

words.","start":120.06,"stop":123.295,"duration":3.23},{"text":"In other words, the -- the issue had -- could not be waived by the government, and no equitable tolling was available.","start":123.295,"stop":129.366,"duration":6.07},{"text":"In this Court's more recent cases, I think the ones that, Justice Ginsburg, you were referring to, in the Henderson case, what this

jurisdictional.","start":129.366,"stop":147.929,"duration":18.56},{"text":"And in this case, we have a statute that had been interpreted by a long line of this Court's decisions, all in the Tucker Act

Act.","start":156.016,"stop":157.035,"duration":1.02},{"text":"The Tucker Act, I think the -- the line that the Court drew, it said if we characterize these as jurisdictional in a prior case, we will stick with that.","start":157.035,"stop":168.257,"duration":11.22},{"text":"But in the future, we're not doing that anymore.","start":168.257,"stop":172.061,"duration":3.8}]},{"speakerName":"Roman Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"--But I think what the Court has said, both in the cases addressing jurisdiction and in the cases -- in the Irwin line of cases addressing the available of -- the

context, and the relevant historical treatment, and that the overarching purpose of the inquiry is going to be to find out what Congress understood itself to be doing at the time that it enacted the statute.","start":185.452,"stop":197.776,"duration":12.32}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"But, Mr. Martinez, wouldn't that argument suggest that Irwin was really only good as to

Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't think so, Your Honor.","start":206.715,"stop":208.215,"duration":1.5},{"text":"I think -- I think what the Court did in Irwin, it didn't conduct a lengthy historical analysis of all statutes that had ever been passed.","start":208.215,"stop":215.385,"duration":7.17},{"text":"But what it did was it -- it based its -- its conclusion and -- and the presumption on a kind of logical inference.","start":215.385,"stop":221.439,"duration":6.05},{"text":"The Court essentially reasoned, as I understood the decision, as follows: The Court said that -- that when -- we think in the mine run of cases when Congress wants to take the big step of waiving sovereign immunity, it's -- it's reasonable to think that Congress also likely wanted to take the small step of allowing equitable tolling.","start":221.439,"stop":238.75,"duration":17.31},{"text":"And that -- and that may well have been true in 1990, when Irwin was announced.","start":238.75,"stop":242.119,"duration":3.37},{"text":"It may have even been true in 1972, when the statute that was addressed in Irwin was announced.","start":242.119,"stop":246.673,"duration":4.55},{"text":"But we know for certain, and I think the parties agree on this, that the rule in 1946, when the FTCA was passed, was something quite different, and the Court addressed that in the Soriano case just a few years later in 1957.","start":246.673,"stop":258.731,"duration":12.06}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"What was different about 1972?","start":258.731,"stop":260.264,"duration":1.53},{"text":"They were pre-Irwin.","start":260.264,"stop":263.816,"duration":3.55},{"text":"So why wouldn't 19 -- a 1972 statute, the extension of Title VII to federal employees, why wouldn't that fall under the old regime instead of the fresh look that Irwin took of it in 1990 as applied to a 1972 statute?","start":263.816,"stop":287.864,"duration":24.05}]},{"speakerName":"Roman Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think the -- the key thing -- the -- the issue in this case is, obviously, the FT -- is, of course, the FTCA.","start":287.864,"stop":292.816,"duration":4.95},{"text":"And I think there are significant distinctions between the FTCA, which was passed in 1946, and the provision that was passed in 1972 that was addressed in -- in Irwin.","start":292.816,"stop":301.839,"duration":9.02},{"text":"And we have statute-specific evidence, it's very detailed and is much -- much more extensive than the evidence that was before the Court -- or that was available in -- with respect to Title VII.","start":301.839,"stop":312.897,"duration":11.06}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"But, you see, I would -- I guess I would have thought that really anything pre-Irwin, the government could stand up and make a very, very similar argument, which is, you know, in this world we actually thought that a statute of limitations with respect to a suit against a government was jurisdictional, did not include equitable tolling, that there were really no decisions the other way, that Congress thought of that as the background rule.","start":312.897,"stop":337.112,"duration":24.22},{"text":"And so what's to prevent this case from essentially becoming everything prior to 1990 is presumed to be jurisdictional contra Irwin?","start":337.112,"stop":348.403,"duration":11.29}]},{"speakerName":"Roman Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, we're not asking for that presumption, and we don't think that the Court needs to apply that presumption.","start":348.403,"stop":353.04,"duration":4.64},{"text":"I think what the Court needs to do is to look at the language of Irwin, which says that there's a presumption.","start":353.04,"stop":357.425,"duration":4.38},{"text":"It's based on its kind of logical inference about the mine run of cases.","start":357.425,"stop":361.31,"duration":3.88},{"text":"But it also says that the presumption is rebuttable.","start":361.31,"stop":363.496,"duration":2.19},{"text":"And it's rebuttable based on statute-specific evidence where the government can come forward and overcome the presumption by showing that, with respect to a particular law, Congress had a different intent in mind.","start":363.496,"stop":374.719,"duration":11.22}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"So if there's ambiguity, what breaks the

are that Congress took this provision out of the jurisdictional section, and put it in -- in a different section, number one; and, number two, it said treat the government like you would treat any other party.","start":383.159,"stop":398.735,"duration":15.58},{"text":"So those two counter.","start":398.735,"stop":401.621,"duration":2.89}]},{"speakerName":"Roman

tie?","start":403.121,"stop":404.706,"duration":1.59}]},{"speakerName":"Roman Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"--Well, I think if there were in fact a tie, I think the -- Irwin does -- does put essentially the slight thumb on the scale in favor of no equitable tolling.","start":404.706,"stop":414.694,"duration":9.99},{"text":"But I don't think that there's a tie in this case for a number of reasons.","start":414.694,"stop":417.796,"duration":3.1},{"text":"Let me just address -- I think the primary reason is the Tucker Act point which I mentioned.","start":417.796,"stop":421.617,"duration":3.82},{"text":"But let me address the two textual points that you raised, Your Honor.","start":421.617,"stop":425.152,"duration":3.53},{"text":"The first argument about the placement of the provisions, as the Court knows, the provisions were separated in 1948 as part of that recodification.","start":425.152,"stop":434.425,"duration":9.27},{"text":"And in the recodification law itself, in Section 33 of the recodification law, Congress expressly forbade any inference of legislative construction of what the statutes meant based on the chapter of U.S. Code of Title 28 in which it was placed.","start":434.425,"stop":450.703,"duration":16.28},{"text":"And so the argument that my friend makes that the placement of the provisions in different chapters, that's -- that's an argument that -- that Congress expressly took off the table.","start":450.703,"stop":460.075,"duration":9.37},{"text":"With respect to the second textual argument--","start":460.075,"stop":462.694,"duration":2.62}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"--That was in the text of the recodification?","start":462.694,"stop":465.144,"duration":2.45}]},{"speakerName":"Roman Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"--Yes.","start":465.144,"stop":465.429,"duration":0.28},{"text":"That was in -- in Section 33 of the 1948 recodification.","start":465.429,"stop":469.098,"duration":3.67},{"text":"And not only that, Your Honor, but -- but I think this Court--","start":469.098,"stop":472.033,"duration":2.94}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Does legislative history support that, too?","start":472.033,"stop":473.717,"duration":1.68}]},{"speakerName":"Roman Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"--It does.","start":473.717,"stop":474.669,"duration":0.95},{"text":"The legislative history supports -- supports it.","start":474.669,"stop":477.021,"duration":2.35},{"text":"It's not just the texture, Justice Scalia.","start":477.021,"stop":479.421,"duration":2.4},{"text":"The -- with respect to the second argument, Justice Sotomayor, that you raised, I think it's true that there's language in -- elsewhere in the FTCA in Section 2674 about the idea that -- that the FTCA intended to create liability where a private person -- in circumstances where a private person would be liable under State law.","start":479.421,"stop":500.969,"duration":21.55},{"text":"But what this Court recognized in Richards and what -- what a lot of courts have recognized, including Judge Friendly's opinion for the Second Circuit in the Kosak case is that the time bar provision, 2401, is an exception to that principle and is essentially a circumstance in which Congress specifically indicated that it didn't want the same rule to apply as would apply between private parties in -- under State law.","start":500.969,"stop":525.435,"duration":24.47},{"text":"And so we don't think that those textual arguments get a lot of traction here and they certainly don't overcome the strongest textual argument which is on our side, which is, of course, the express and deliberate incorporation of the Tucker Act language that it applied to Tucker Act suits in the court of claims.","start":525.435,"stop":541.544,"duration":16.11}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Tucker Act doesn't have to the same extent, in the same manner and to the same extent as with respect to a private party.","start":541.544,"stop":549.983,"duration":8.44},{"text":"That's new in the Tort Claims Act.","start":549.983,"stop":552.669,"duration":2.69}]},{"speakerName":"Roman Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"It -- it's true that the Tucker Act doesn't have that language.","start":552.669,"stop":555.104,"duration":2.44},{"text":"I don't think it needed that language because the Tucker Act -- essentially, that language in the Tort Claims Act, I think, is intended to point to the substantive -- the law that's supposed to be applied, as this Court recognized in Richards.","start":555.104,"stop":567.345,"duration":12.24},{"text":"And so it says, you know, look to State law when you're applying the tort law.","start":567.345,"stop":571.147,"duration":3.8},{"text":"The Tucker Act is a little different because there you're applying Federal law.","start":571.147,"stop":574.348,"duration":3.2},{"text":"You're applying Federal constitutional law, Federal statutory law or the Federal common law of contracts in the Tucker Act context.","start":574.348,"stop":581.104,"duration":6.76},{"text":"So it didn't need that language.","start":581.104,"stop":582.438,"duration":1.33},{"text":"But what the Court has recognized in its cases is, again, that that principle of -- sort of the parity principle, you know, treat the government like a private party, that -- that 2401(b) is really an exception to that principle.","start":582.438,"stop":594.412,"duration":11.97}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"I take it that your argument would apply not only to 2401(b), but also to 2401(a)?","start":594.412,"stop":601.268,"duration":6.86}]},{"speakerName":"Roman Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"We -- the government's position is that 2401(a) is -- is also jurisdictional, not subject to tolling.","start":601.268,"stop":607.839,"duration":6.57},{"text":"But our argument is really that the Irwin inquiry requires a statute-specific inquiry.","start":607.839,"stop":613.059,"duration":5.22},{"text":"And so--","start":613.059,"stop":613.809,"duration":0.75}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"But it's the same language.","start":613.809,"stop":615.275,"duration":1.47},{"text":"And if I understood the argument you're -- you're making, it's -- your essential argument is this incorporated the Tucker language, Congress knew what the Tucker language meant, therefore, Congress understood these to be jurisdictional as well.","start":615.275,"stop":628.319,"duration":13.04}]},{"speakerName":"Roman Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"--Your Honor, I don't want to resist your -- your point too much, but I do want to point thought that 2401(a)'s history is slightly different.","start":628.319,"stop":635.073,"duration":6.75},{"text":"The language in 2401(a) actually originates in the Tucker Act itself in 1887.","start":635.073,"stop":640.393,"duration":5.32},{"text":"The language from 2501 actually came from the 1863 statute, and that's the language, the actual -- you know, the 12-word phrase that's repeated in 2401(b) comes from that provision.","start":640.393,"stop":654.969,"duration":14.58},{"text":"So there's some slight differences, but we're not going to fight.","start":654.969,"stop":657.754,"duration":2.78},{"text":"We certainly would agree that the -- that the 2401(a) language is -- is jurisdictional and that's being litigated in the lower courts.","start":657.754,"stop":664.175,"duration":6.42}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"I meant, I have to think that this is just all over the U.S. Code, this kind of language.","start":664.175,"stop":668.394,"duration":4.22},{"text":"There's nothing unusual about this language “ shall be barred ”.","start":668.394,"stop":671.596,"duration":3.2},{"text":"This is kind of the classic language, right?","start":671.596,"stop":673.781,"duration":2.18}]},{"speakerName":"Roman Martinez","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that the “ shall be barred ” or “ forever barred ”, that language does appear in a couple of places.","start":673.781,"stop":679.602,"duration":5.82},{"text":"But I think what -- what's important for purposes of our argument is not just that two-word phrase, but the broader phrase, because the broader phrase is what shows that when -- when the human being who sat down on behalf of Congress to actually write this statute, it shows, I think, that he was basing it -- he was essentially cut and pasting from the preexisting Tucker Act provision.","start":679.602,"stop":698.329,"duration":18.73},{"text":"And so that language that's relevant is not just “ forever barred ”, but the phrase","start":698.329,"stop":701.783,"duration":3.45},{"text":"\"every claim against the United States cognizable shall be forever barred unless.

apply to certain claims, quote, “ not sounding in tort ”, unquote.","start":720.162,"stop":726.166,"duration":6},{"text":"And the legislative history that -- that we've cited in our briefs discussing the purposes of the FTCA makes clear that Congress was looking at the -- the Tucker Act, they saw that there was this hole for tort claims, they wanted to plug that gap, and they wanted to give tort claimants, in the language of the -- of the relevant committee reports, the same right to a day in court that claimants had under the Tucker Act.","start":726.166,"stop":750.031,"duration":23.86}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"It sounds to me like, the way you're going about this inquiry, we're going to have to take a
