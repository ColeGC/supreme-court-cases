Circuit in Archer, which is cited in our brief, has held that possession of a concealed weapon is not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.","start":3091.274,"stop":3099.029,"duration":7.76},{"text":"In addition, in the Fourth -- I'm sorry, the Ninth Circuit in a case called Fish, which I am not sure whether we've cited it in our brief, but it's a 2004 decision, held that possession of a pipe bomb was not a crime of violence under the sentencing guideline provision, not the Armed Career Criminal Act.","start":3099.029,"stop":3115.391,"duration":16.36},{"text":"And I do agree with my opposing counsel that there's been one decision that went the way we disagree with in the Fourth Circuit about

differently.","start":3135.202,"stop":3141.122,"duration":5.92},{"text":"Here we have a very clear textual justification in terms of use of explosives, which gives us a strong signal that mere possession wasn't contemplated.","start":3141.122,"stop":3150.312,"duration":9.19},{"text":"The government invites this Court to do pretty convoluted reasoning, adopting an unstated definition from a totally unrelated statute in Title 26.","start":3150.312,"stop":3160.853,"duration":10.54},{"text":"And assuming that Congress meant when it said use of explosives, that all things listed in the National Firearms Act would be included by mere possession, I don't think we can make that leap.","start":3160.853,"stop":3172.578,"duration":11.72},{"text":"Your Honors, it's also not true that there

possessed in some context or another, and Michigan has just indicated that perhaps the old historical reputation of this weapon is no longer deserved.","start":3179.497,"stop":3193.324,"duration":13.83},{"text":"But this Court doesn't have to like the short-barreled shotgun or decide that it's even an appropriate weapon for punish -- or

Honors, the relevant analysis has to begin with the offense.","start":3208.251,"stop":3212.638,"duration":4.39},{"text":"And the government tries over and over again to say, well, it's obvious that these would only be possessed for nefarious reason, but they cannot substantiate that.","start":3212.638,"stop":3221.576,"duration":8.94},{"text":"They disagree with the 14 cases I encourage the Court to look at from page 14 of our reply brief, that those are mere possession cases.","start":3221.576,"stop":3231.116,"duration":9.54},{"text":"By characterizing the people who possessed those weapons, they were found during the course of investigations of other crimes, but that doesn't mean a single one of those possession acts was actually possession during a crime.","start":3231.116,"stop":3243.507,"duration":12.39},{"text":"And this Court certainly can't assume that merely because a criminal or a bad person had possessed the weapon, that they possessed it for nefarious purposes.","start":3243.507,"stop":3253.73,"duration":10.22},{"text":"Finally, Your Honors, I would really encourage the Court to consider the -- the rule of lenity and its
