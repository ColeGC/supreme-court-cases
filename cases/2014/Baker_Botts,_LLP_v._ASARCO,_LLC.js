Now, of course, ASARCO's position would categorically ban all compensation for law firms, even those retained by the trustee that defend their fee application; it would categorically ban compensation by the accountants.

And, in fact, those concerns are heightened much more in the bankruptcy context for a few reasons, because in bankruptcy, the fee application is far more detailed and gives far more opportunity to -- to pick and -- and object and a far greater range of objectors are available, the U.S. trustee, the court itself, the creditors, the creditors committees.","start":387.195,"stop":418.44,"duration":31.25},{"text":"All of those can come in and object that do not exist in the fee-shifting context.

And that's why Congress recognized in Section 330(a)(4)(A)(ii) that services necessary to case administration do fall within the bankruptcy court's discretion to compensate. And when you read Section 330(a)(6)'s reflection that preparing the fee application is compensable, it's clearly not authorizing compensation for preparing it, as ASARCO concedes that, it's authorized under Section 330(a)(1)(A) as a service rendered, and it's most naturally falls within Section 330(a)(4)(A)(ii) as a service necessary to case administration.","start":469.65,"stop":515.17,"duration":45.52},{"text":"And that's because it assists the trustees.","start":515.17,"stop":517.72,"duration":2.55},{"text":"The trustee has to see the case all the way through to its completion.","start":517.72,"stop":521.72,"duration":4},{"text":"It has to make a final accounting of the case.","start":521.72,"stop":524.11,"duration":2.39},{"text":"It has to administer and close the case.","start":524.11,"stop":526.51,"duration":2.4},{"text":"And none of those things can happen until the fee application is not just prepared, but litigated.

It would -- it would candidly just go straight through that decision if it was okay for a Section 327(a) professional, to nonetheless go hire somebody, have them do professional services, and then just count it as, you know, the accountant's own professional services, or, as was suggested today, to simply call professional services necessary expense.
