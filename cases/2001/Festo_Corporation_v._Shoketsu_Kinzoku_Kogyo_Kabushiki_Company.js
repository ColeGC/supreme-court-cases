[Laughter]","start":15.232,"stop":20.145,"duration":4.91},{"text":"The Federal circuit's rules in this case ought to be reversed because it flatly contradicts this Court's decision in Warner-Jenkinson, and furthermore, it radically undermines the patent system.","start":20.145,"stop":31.541,"duration":11.4},{"text":"I think Warner-Jenkinson should be reaffirmed because it's in keeping with the Patent Act, with the goals and policies of the patent system, and because it is much fairer than the harsh inequities of this new rule which this case presents a prime example.","start":31.541,"stop":48.464,"duration":16.92},{"text":"Warner... let me discuss the crucial differences between Warner-Jenkinson and the Federal circuit's new rules.","start":48.464,"stop":55.522,"duration":7.06},{"text":"In the first place, Warner-Jenkinson holds that prosecution history estoppel arises only when an amendment to a patent surrenders subject matter... and clearly surrenders it... in order to achieve patentability.","start":55.522,"stop":70.672,"duration":15.15},{"text":"The Federal circuit holds to the contrary that any narrowing amendment, regardless of the reason for it, creates prosecution history estoppel.","start":70.672,"stop":80.331,"duration":9.66},{"text":"Second, the Warner-Jenkinson case holds that the reason for an amendment determines whether an estoppel is created.","start":80.331,"stop":88.672,"duration":8.34},{"text":"The Federal circuit denies that and holds that the reason is irrelevant, and if an amendment has the narrowing effect, intended or not, it creates a complete estoppel.","start":88.672,"stop":100.643,"duration":11.97},{"text":"Thus, if the patent examiner said he found the claims to be imprecise and the applicant made an amendment to clarify what the examiner thought was imprecise, that might be held to be a narrowing amendment and the patent would be unenforceable.","start":100.643,"stop":118.969,"duration":18.33},{"text":"And that is what happened to Festo in this case.","start":118.969,"stop":121.115,"duration":2.15},{"text":"And those results cannot be squared with Warner-Jenkinson.","start":121.115,"stop":124.83,"duration":3.72},{"text":"Third, the Federal circuit holds that an amendment creates an estoppel if it applies to any of the statutory requirements for obtaining a patent, not just patent... not just patentability as defined by the Patent Act, but any of the requirements for obtaining a patent.","start":124.83,"stop":145.243,"duration":20.41},{"text":"Now, the Patent Act makes clear a distinction between patentability and other requirements.","start":145.243,"stop":151.951,"duration":6.71},{"text":"Sections 101 through 103 come under the heading of patentability of inventions, and they state the substantive requirements for
