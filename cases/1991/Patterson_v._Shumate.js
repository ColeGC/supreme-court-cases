applicable nonbankruptcy law.","start":2410.195,"stop":2418.188,"duration":7.99},{"text":"Indeed, the Fifth Circuit, which ruled contrary to our position in Goff, acknowledged the facially broad language of the statute and went on not to follow the facially broad language of the statute because it felt that the legislative history suggested that applicable nonbankruptcy law was limited to State spendthrift trust law.","start":2418.188,"stop":2444.767,"duration":26.58},{"text":"I would suggest that that is not a proper way to read the statute.","start":2444.767,"stop":2448.821,"duration":4.05},{"text":"Applicable nonbankruptcy would seem to cover ERISA.","start":2448.821,"stop":2452.634,"duration":3.81},{"text":"If that is so, then in those cases where a pension plan has an anti-alienation provision, mandated by ERISA, then the benefits are excluded from the bankruptcy estate under the plain language of the exclusion provision.","start":2452.634,"stop":2470.345,"duration":17.71},{"text":"The second point that has also been made is that the exemption provisions are not contrary to the straightforward reading that I have just tried to give to the exclusion provision.","start":2470.345,"stop":2482.854,"duration":12.51},{"text":"The exemption provision that petitioner has focused on today is the 522(d)(10)(e)

this.","start":2493.432,"stop":2498.625,"duration":5.19},{"text":"First, that provision covers all sorts of pension plans, not just pension plans that qualify for tax benefits under ERISA.","start":2498.625,"stop":2509.491,"duration":10.87},{"text":"If a... those sorts of pension plans, those that aren't qualified under ERISA, of course, do not contain an ERISA-mandated anti-alienation provision.","start":2509.491,"stop":2520.86,"duration":11.37},{"text":"And in cases involving such benefits, they would not necessarily be excluded from the bankruptcy estate and therefore might be subject to exemption under 522(d).","start":2520.86,"stop":2533.249,"duration":12.39},{"text":"Let me add that there are three significant categories of pension plans that qualify for tax benefits under ERISA, and yet are not required by the statute to have an anti-alienation provision.","start":2533.249,"stop":2546.959,"duration":13.71},{"text":"And those are governmental pension plans, church pension plans and Individual Retirement Accounts.","start":2546.959,"stop":2553.414,"duration":6.46},{"text":"Again, under our reading of the statute, those plans are not necessarily excluded from the bankruptcy estate.","start":2553.414,"stop":2561.892,"duration":8.48},{"text":"Interests in such plans would only be excluded if they happen to qualify under State spendthrift trust law, but interest in such plans are subject to exemption under section 522(d)(10)(e).","start":2561.892,"stop":2576.023,"duration":14.13},{"text":"And without section 522(d)(10)(e), interest in such plans might be totally distributed to creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.","start":2576.023,"stop":2585.557,"duration":9.53},{"text":"So section 522(d)(10)(e) serves the very

start.","start":2585.557,"stop":2602.82,"duration":17.26},{"text":"If applicable nonbankruptcy law is read to include ERISA, then the statutes harmonize and the anti-alienation provision is given its full force.","start":2602.82,"stop":2617.581,"duration":14.76},{"text":"If it is read in the restrictive manner that petitioner proposes there is a real
