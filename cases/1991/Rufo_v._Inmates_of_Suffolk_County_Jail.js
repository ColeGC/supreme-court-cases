which opened in May of 1990, we have 419 cells for male inmates.","start":212.872,"stop":222.911,"duration":10.04},{"text":"We've asked to double-bunk 197 of them.","start":222.911,"stop":225.762,"duration":2.85},{"text":"Given our count statistics, it is highly unlikely we would ever exceed... go beyond the 197 that we intend to double-bunk.","start":225.762,"stop":233.952,"duration":8.19},{"text":"That is, our counts typically have been lately run... typically run in the area of 480 inmates, where we have only 419

result in a complete cure of this problem.","start":243.908,"stop":247.526,"duration":3.62},{"text":"The second adverse effect, the keeping this consent decree in place, has been on the functioning of the State bail statute.","start":247.526,"stop":256.132,"duration":8.61},{"text":"There are occasions where the sheriff does not have a sufficient number of inmates who qualify for transfer to a State correctional facility.","start":256.132,"stop":265.222,"duration":9.09},{"text":"Because under State law, the only persons who may be transferred are pre-trial detainees who have served a prior State felony sentence.","start":265.222,"stop":272.327,"duration":7.11},{"text":"If those types of inmates are not available, and the sheriff still has more inmates than 419 cells at the jail, what he must do is then submit a list of names to a superior court judge.","start":272.327,"stop":287.087,"duration":14.76},{"text":"And the superior court judge then takes individuals who are being held on bail and reduces them to release on recognizance, so that they may be transferred to a half-way house facility, which is an insecure facility, whereas the jail is a maximum security facility.","start":287.087,"stop":302.697,"duration":15.61},{"text":"Those individuals, the record shows, 10 to 15 percent of those individuals then walk away from that facility.","start":302.697,"stop":308.25,"duration":5.55},{"text":"These persons are persons who at least one judge of the courts in Suffolk County... and in most instances two judges... have adjudicated as persons for whom the setting of bail is necessary to ensure their appearance at trial.","start":308.25,"stop":321.058,"duration":12.81},{"text":"This is a second adverse effect of the court's decision below because it is now interfering with the functioning of the State bail statute in having individuals released on recognizance who would not otherwise qualify for that status.","start":321.058,"stop":334.251,"duration":13.19},{"text":"It is these interferences with the administration of the State correctional system, the county pre-trial detention system, and the State bail statute that the sheriff sought to avoid in this case when he proposed to double-bunk 197 of the 400... 197 of the 435 cells at the Suffolk County Jail.","start":334.251,"stop":355.647,"duration":21.4},{"text":"The remainder of those cells, 34 of them are for female detainees.","start":355.647,"stop":359.449,"duration":3.8},{"text":"When the sheriff made that proposal, he proposed to... leave in place, all of the remaining provisions of the consent decree.","start":359.449,"stop":368.872,"duration":9.42},{"text":"The consent decree in this case provided for the construction of a jail which far exceeds constitutional requirements.","start":368.872,"stop":376.478,"duration":7.61},{"text":"And although the sheriff proposed to double-bunk, none of the other features of the consent decree would be disturbed by the sheriff's proposal for modification.","start":376.478,"stop":384.917,"duration":8.44},{"text":"For example, there are outdoor recreation areas which would have been left intact, indoor recreation areas, contact visiting areas.","start":384.917,"stop":393.872,"duration":8.96},{"text":"Specialized cells would not be double-bunked.","start":393.872,"stop":396.891,"duration":3.02},{"text":"Any of the specialized cells in this facility would remain for those purposes... that is, infirmary cells, psychiatric cells, suicide-prevention cells.","start":396.891,"stop":403.378,"duration":6.49},{"text":"None of the other architectural feature, or other features of the facility would be altered, except for double-bunking 197 of the cells.","start":403.378,"stop":412.651,"duration":9.27},{"text":"Furthermore, the sheriff's proposal to the district court would have required that individuals who are double-bunked are only those individuals who would have qualified as eligible for double-bunking under the classification program of the National Sheriffs Association, which in this case, was further reviewed and approved by an accredited auditor of the American Correctional Association.","start":412.651,"stop":433.331,"duration":20.68},{"text":"And it was this proposal which was denied by the
