Dyk","textObjs":[{"text":"If that were the case, that would be true, but I think that the record pretty clearly establishes first of all that the claim at the time of the bankruptcy filing was worth $110,000 and the later calculations made at the time of the settlement show that only approximately even as of that time only about 30 percent of that claim was for front pay as opposed to back pay.","start":710.199,"stop":736.095,"duration":25.9}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony M.
