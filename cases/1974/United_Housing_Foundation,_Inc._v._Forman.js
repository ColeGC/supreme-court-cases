the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.","start":47.784,"stop":60.349,"duration":12.56},{"text":"That court had reversed a judgment dismissing the complaint filed herein for want of subject matter jurisdiction in the federal court.","start":60.349,"stop":74.205,"duration":13.86},{"text":"The respondents in this case who are the plaintiffs in the court below, are a number of residents of a residential development called Co-op City located in the borough of the Bronx in the City of New York.","start":74.205,"stop":94.582,"duration":20.38},{"text":"These respondents purport to represent a class to wit all of the owners of apartments in Co-op City, which is a giant development and contains more than 15,000 homes.","start":94.582,"stop":113.147,"duration":18.57},{"text":"The suit was generated by the said circumstance to which we've all been recently exposed.","start":113.147,"stop":120.085,"duration":6.94},{"text":"Namely that there was an escalation in the cost of the maintenance of the apartments which the defendants had -- respondents had acquired.","start":120.085,"stop":132.364,"duration":12.28},{"text":"And the proffered basis for federal jurisdiction was the allegation that the petitioners had violated the securities laws to the respondent's detriment.","start":132.364,"stop":144.13,"duration":11.77},{"text":"The complaint itself consisted I believe of 13 counts of which ten were state related claims.","start":144.13,"stop":154.053,"duration":9.92},{"text":"One was a 1933 Act violation and the same facts were alleged as a 1934 violation.","start":154.053,"stop":161.559,"duration":7.51},{"text":"And then there was one claim against the state and the state agency I believe under the Civil Rights law.","start":161.559,"stop":168.636,"duration":7.08},{"text":"And the central question which the case brings up for review is this.","start":168.636,"stop":173.528,"duration":4.89},{"text":"Did the Congress in the securities laws intend to reach the transaction which underlies this case?","start":173.528,"stop":183.023,"duration":9.5},{"text":"And that transaction, I shall of course describe.","start":183.023,"stop":187.015,"duration":3.99},{"text":"We assert the negative of that question.","start":187.015,"stop":190.911,"duration":3.9},{"text":"In other words, that Congress had no such intention.","start":190.911,"stop":194.352,"duration":3.44},{"text":"And our argument will rest on three pedestals and I believe that each of them would support the conclusion we are here to contend.","start":194.352,"stop":205.806,"duration":11.45},{"text":"First that this transaction related to homes not to securities and not to investments.","start":205.806,"stop":216.816,"duration":11.01},{"text":"Secondly that this is a transaction to which commercial considerations and profit possibilities are roughly alien and therefore not within the realm of congressional concern at all.","start":216.816,"stop":236.246,"duration":19.43},{"text":"And lastly, we are dealing here with a state created welfare plan in which the state selected and conferred upon a group of its beneficiaries, a group of its citizens, various benefits.","start":236.246,"stop":260.736,"duration":24.49},{"text":"And as far as I can read the history of congressional intention, I find that Congress has indicated no interest in penetrating this field.","start":260.736,"stop":273.043,"duration":12.31},{"text":"We start therefore in narrating our story with the State of New York.","start":273.043,"stop":283.026,"duration":9.98},{"text":"Acting through its legislature, the State of New York became concerned with the plight of the city.","start":283.026,"stop":291.312,"duration":8.29},{"text":"This was in the early 60s, the flight of the urban middle class, the blight of the inner city slum, the decay of the housing inventory in the big cities, the high cost of replacement of dwellings making safe and clean dwellings unattainable by wage earners and other people of low modest income.","start":291.312,"stop":318.502,"duration":27.19},{"text":"Certainly, an area of governmental concern which I am sure this Court has heard of many times.","start":318.502,"stop":326.242,"duration":7.74},{"text":"And the state determined to make a massive contribution towards the alleviation of the conditions I have described.","start":326.242,"stop":334.795,"duration":8.55},{"text":"Its concern, the state's concern, was with homes and dwelling places for its residents and citizens.","start":334.795,"stop":341.977,"duration":7.18},{"text":"Not securities and not investment opportunities.","start":341.977,"stop":346.84,"duration":4.86},{"text":"New York passed a law called the Mitchell-Lama Law, which contained various provisions for variety of possibilities, but with respect to the subject that we're concerned with, I will say that it created first a regulatory agency which has applied into Co-op City has provided a system of supervision and regulation vastly more pervasive than any system of regulation that we are familiar with say in the utility field or the banking field or the airplane field or any of the normal objects of regulation.","start":346.84,"stop":387.001,"duration":40.16},{"text":"And I believe I state correctly that my learned adversaries agree with me that this was a very pervasive system of control.","start":387.001,"stop":396.572,"duration":9.57},{"text":"And of course there was a very good reason for it.","start":396.572,"stop":399.139,"duration":2.57},{"text":"The state was going to provide massive benefits to those who are going to be the beneficiaries of this law.","start":399.139,"stop":407.099,"duration":7.96},{"text":"It provided the means for the obtaining of the money necessary, or the bulk of the money necessary for the creation of this new housing which it contemplated.","start":407.099,"stop":422.678,"duration":15.58},{"text":"The state was offering to the prospective members of Co-op City whom it selected the following benefits among others.","start":422.678,"stop":433.656,"duration":10.98},{"text":"First, savings regularized from the availability of construction and acquisition costs at very low cost, because the state agency could raise that money by tax exempt obligations of the agency.","start":433.656,"stop":454.146,"duration":20.49},{"text":"I need hardly say that that represents an enormous fraction of the cost of housing, the cost of the money used in construction.","start":454.146,"stop":463.422,"duration":9.28},{"text":"Then there were savings conferred upon the members of this cooperative by the reduction or abatement of real estate taxes to the extent of 80% thereof, again, a very enormous benefit in the maintenance of these properties.","start":463.422,"stop":485.87,"duration":22.45},{"text":"And then, with the collaboration of a philanthropic foundation called the United Housing Foundation, which I shall describe later, savings became possible in Co-op City by the elimination of the promoters' profit, the entrepreneurs' profit, the builders' profit and the managers' profit.","start":485.87,"stop":510.033,"duration":24.16},{"text":"All of those were eliminated.","start":510.033,"stop":513.279,"duration":3.25},{"text":"And then the cost overall was spread over a period of 40 years, thus making the annual burden a very modest one indeed plus other benefits that I mentioned some of which, I mentioned in my brief, but are relatively smaller in proportion.","start":513.279,"stop":532.086,"duration":18.81},{"text":"It was all of these together that made it possible to do what seems like a miracle today to be able to sell apartments at the price of $450.00 per room, a four-room apartment for $1,800.00.","start":532.086,"stop":547.623,"duration":15.54},{"text":"Anyone who has purchased a cooperative apartment knows that that is one of the miracles of the age.","start":547.623,"stop":555.025,"duration":7.4},{"text":"Now, as I have said, Co-op City was sponsored by the United Housing Foundation.","start":555.025,"stop":565.677,"duration":10.65},{"text":"This foundation is composed of a group of labor unions well known for their progressive policies, like the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union whose record of performance of this area is well-known.","start":565.677,"stop":585.265,"duration":19.59},{"text":"Housing cooperatives, civic leaders all volunteers who furnished to this project the sense of community involvement who furnished it the enriching advice of knowledgeable, distinguished and dedicated citizen and whose standing in the community was such that they were able to had a little lubrication to the wheels of the bureaucracy.","start":585.265,"stop":617.153,"duration":31.89},{"text":"And perhaps more important than any of these to ensure the generating idea, the idealism behind this entire project, namely the ideal of a community of home owning neighbors democratically managed, nondiscriminatory in style endowed with the humane amenities in the artistic and spiritual fields of community of homes and a community of homes.","start":617.153,"stop":653.729,"duration":36.58},{"text":"Now this was not the first experience of the United Housing Foundation in this field.","start":653.729,"stop":659.292,"duration":5.56},{"text":"It had a long record of success in promoting and creating housing projects similarly endowed with this spiritual concept.","start":659.292,"stop":670.565,"duration":11.27},{"text":"And on my brief, I cite quite a number of famous ones that are extent in the City of New York.","start":670.565,"stop":676.319,"duration":5.75},{"text":"And so it was that a city housing something like 50,000 people was built on what a previously been a playground in the northern part of the Bronx.","start":676.319,"stop":688.596,"duration":12.28},{"text":"And it took a very considerable period to do it, from 1964 to 1972.","start":688.596,"stop":696.119,"duration":7.52},{"text":"And during that period, I need hardly say that costs were climbing.","start":696.119,"stop":701.244,"duration":5.13},{"text":"Every other index of our economy showed a similar climb in the sense of inflationary costs.","start":701.244,"stop":709.532,"duration":8.29},{"text":"Ultimately the project cost $422 million considerably in excess of the original estimates.","start":709.532,"stop":719.88,"duration":10.35},{"text":"And of these $420 million, the state agency furnished 92.26%, and I want to emphasize again that not only did the law specify the classes of members who might live in this cooperative, namely the applicants have to show that their earnings were not in excess of six times the estimated maintenance charges.","start":719.88,"stop":754.158,"duration":34.28},{"text":"But the very individuals who are accepted for membership in this coop have to be approved by the state authorities, certainly not an aspect which is normally found in the sale of investment securities or speculations.","start":754.158,"stop":771.345,"duration":17.19}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"What were

entire transaction.","start":793.67,"stop":801.721,"duration":8.05},{"text":"There was one concept that was excluded from every phase of this enterprise, the concept of commercialism and the corollary concept of profit.","start":801.721,"stop":813.326,"duration":11.61},{"text":"This applied at all stages of the transaction and not only to the one which is most directly relevant to the question before this Court.","start":813.326,"stop":823.103,"duration":9.78},{"text":"For instance, members of Co-op City could receive no dividends.","start":823.103,"stop":830.383,"duration":7.28},{"text":"Now I know that my learned friend says that they could under a Section of the law.","start":830.383,"stop":836.56,"duration":6.18},{"text":"He misreads the law.","start":836.56,"stop":838.169,"duration":1.61},{"text":"That Section deals with rental properties by private builders but who have the right to have limited profit returns, not to Co-op City.","start":838.169,"stop":850.586,"duration":12.42},{"text":"The court below said that there might be a rebate on the rental if the cost of maintenance was less than was estimated.","start":850.586,"stop":859.564,"duration":8.98},{"text":"That is true since the cost of maintenance in a cooperative is shared by all the members of the cooperative, and is based on an estimate if at the end it turned out that the estimate was excessive, the excess is turned back to those who have provided it.","start":859.564,"stop":875.683,"duration":16.12},{"text":"I don't call that a dividend.","start":875.683,"stop":879.763,"duration":4.08},{"text":"They could sell the homes that they had acquired but for no more than the cost at which they paid for it, $450 a room, not a dollar more could they get for their homes no matter how much land values or building values may have escalated in the City of New York.","start":879.763,"stop":902.551,"duration":22.79},{"text":"And not only that, they have to sell their homes if they move from the premises.","start":902.551,"stop":907.817,"duration":5.27},{"text":"It was only a home for their personal residences and that of their surviving spouse.","start":907.817,"stop":913.659,"duration":5.84},{"text":"But if for any reason they wanted to move out of the Co-op City, they had to offer their apartments, their homes for sale to the corporation -- to the coop corporation or to a qualified new buyer at the price at which they bought.","start":913.659,"stop":933.641,"duration":19.98},{"text":"Not only were they not promised any profits, in the literature which announced this project, they were told in words loud and clear that there could not be any.","start":933.641,"stop":947.501,"duration":13.86},{"text":"Now I move up the scale away from the cooperators upward.","start":947.501,"stop":951.619,"duration":4.12},{"text":"The United Housing Foundation, which was the sponsor of the project was formed under a statute in New York called the not for Profit Corporation Law.","start":951.619,"stop":962.881,"duration":11.26},{"text":"It could make no profit because under the statute of its creation, it was forbidden to do so.","start":962.881,"stop":969.556,"duration":6.68},{"text":"The construction was done by a wholly owned subsidiary of United Housing Foundation.","start":969.556,"stop":976.458,"duration":6.9},{"text":"And while that was organized as an ordinary corporation, since its stockholders could make no profit, namely the United Housing Foundation, there would be no point in the subsidiary earning any profits.","start":976.458,"stop":990.933,"duration":14.48},{"text":"The subscribers were not offered tax deduction as an inducement in the sense that tax shelters are marketed around the street as this Court well knows, where tax shelters are offered as a form of investment.","start":990.933,"stop":1007.614,"duration":16.68},{"text":"That was not the approach here because there were no such possibilities, except for the modest tax deduction which is available to every homeowner on the interest of his mortgage and on the taxes which he contributes to the -- to his community.","start":1007.614,"stop":1024.356,"duration":16.74},{"text":"They were not offered any significant outside income.","start":1024.356,"stop":1031.811,"duration":7.45},{"text":"That is this was not a project where in addition to homes, there was a vast shopping center attached to it from which the people could hope to derive substantial speculative profits, because had that happened the law would not have permitted this project to be financed under the statute at which I have referred.","start":1031.811,"stop":1050.894,"duration":19.08},{"text":"All they were offered and all that these people received was the opportunity to own a home, and that only so long as they lived in it.","start":1050.894,"stop":1062.984,"duration":12.09},{"text":"And if they have to part with it, they could enjoy no form of capital appreciation.","start":1062.984,"stop":1070.197,"duration":7.21},{"text":"Now membership in this cooperation was memorialized in two instruments, two writings.","start":1070.197,"stop":1077.259,"duration":7.06},{"text":"One, an occupancy agreement, so-called but actually reads very much like an ordinary lease.","start":1077.259,"stop":1086.837,"duration":9.58},{"text":"And secondly, an instrument which was called a share of stock, but differing in many ways from the conventional one especially in the very fact that it could not be sold, could not be authenticated, couldn't be transferred, couldn't be given away and with which you have would to part once you cease being the occupant of the apartment which you had bought.","start":1086.837,"stop":1110.743,"duration":23.91},{"text":"Now both the District Court and the Court of Appeals have very meticulously expressed their avoidance of entertaining any opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy between the plaintiffs and the defendants or between the petitioners and respondents.","start":1110.743,"stop":1140.493,"duration":29.75},{"text":"I have observed that my good learned friends have extensively argued the merits of the case in their briefs, but I shall not do so.","start":1140.493,"stop":1149.809,"duration":9.32},{"text":"I shall rely on the proposition that the only question before this Court is whether this controversy belongs in a federal forum under the securities laws, or whether it belongs in the state forum under laws adequate for that purpose in the State of New York.","start":1149.809,"stop":1164.662,"duration":14.85},{"text":"The district judge made this comment.","start":1164.662,"stop":1167.972,"duration":3.31},{"text":"“It is well to know that the outset of this inquiry that it is the fundamental nonprofit nature of this transaction which in this court's view, is the insurmountable barrier to plaintiffs claim in the federal court.”","start":1167.972,"stop":1183.83,"duration":15.86},{"text":"And we agree with that expression and hope to win favor for it.","start":1183.83,"stop":1191.45,"duration":7.62},{"text":"Our claim is a very narrow one actually.","start":1191.45,"stop":1196.054,"duration":4.6},{"text":"Our central point is that Congress did not intend to bring within the ambit of the securities laws an enterprise devoted to the purchase of homes a state dominated enterprise with philanthropic and community participation to which the notion of profit is utterly foreign.","start":1196.054,"stop":1220.331,"duration":24.28},{"text":"A project pursued without the profit motive promoted without profit inducement and shared by its beneficiaries without the any expectation of gain, and the history, the legislative history suggests to me that that is not what Congress had in mind.","start":1220.331,"stop":1239.039,"duration":18.71},{"text":"Because the evils against which these securities laws were written are still sufficiently vivid so that most of us can remember them from actual experience.","start":1239.039,"stop":1251.315,"duration":12.28},{"text":"Predatory financial practices in the securities markets, stock market price manipulation, luring of small investors by false promises of easy wealth.","start":1251.315,"stop":1265.728,"duration":14.41},{"text":"In short, I submit that the realm of congressional concern was the speculation and investment realm and its identifying flag was the promise or expectation of profit, and one cannot read in my opinion the legislative history of either the 1933 or the 1934 Act without coming to that conclusion.","start":1265.728,"stop":1288.091,"duration":22.36},{"text":"The District Court read that history accurately when it concluded that Congress did not intend to sweep into the ambit of the Federal Securities laws.","start":1288.091,"stop":1296.73,"duration":8.64},{"text":"State encouraged nonprofit transactions made pursuant to a state emergency housing law, all three elements that I've mentioned available only to state residents.","start":1296.73,"stop":1309.75,"duration":13.02},{"text":"Now, in reaching a contrary conclusion, I believe that the Court of Appeals was in error and I
