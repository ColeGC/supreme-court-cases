Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, Mr. Bork, where you're appealing from a judgment holding a federal statute unconstitutional under 1252 you don’t find the counter part of 1253’s language where the right to appeal turns on whether or not three-judge District Court was required, do you?","start":389.696,"stop":408.526,"duration":18.83}]},{"speakerName":"Robert H.

Bork","textObjs":[{"text":"That’s quite correct.","start":442,"stop":443.371,"duration":1.37},{"text":"The appellee’s argument on this point before was that they did not convene a three-judge District Court because the average decision holding Article 134 unconstitutional was the decision of the DC Circuit and therefore whether it was a three-judge court or to single-judge court made no difference.","start":443.371,"stop":460.219,"duration":16.85},{"text":"It must follow the Court of Appeals’ opinion.","start":460.219,"stop":463.437,"duration":3.22},{"text":"I think if that’s true then there was no substantial question for a District Court to decide and there is no point in convening a three-judge District Court which must automatically a follow Court of Appeals’ decision.","start":463.437,"stop":473.711,"duration":10.27},{"text":"Our argument was somewhat different and it was that -- there was no substantial question because the District Court misunderstood the question before it.","start":473.711,"stop":482.356,"duration":8.64},{"text":"It was not a question about the first two sections of Article 134.","start":482.356,"stop":486.221,"duration":3.87},{"text":"It was simply a question about the third section which is an assimilative crime statute and as to which nobody claims, there's a problem with constitutionality.","start":486.221,"stop":494.476,"duration":8.25},{"text":"So that there was no substantial question before the District Court to decide whether or not the District Court thought so and I think it is indeed the nature of the question rather than the subjective perception of the judge that determine his jurisdiction.","start":494.476,"stop":510.058,"duration":15.58},{"text":"But perhaps we need not even go as far as your question suggest Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I think if one goes that far it’s quite clear that there is appellate jurisdiction in this Court and that -- as I say that is a subject no longer disputed by appellee.","start":510.058,"stop":531.002,"duration":20.94},{"text":"And of the only question left as I say is the question of District Court control of the pretrial discovery process of the court martial.","start":531.002,"stop":542.82,"duration":11.82},{"text":"And I think it’s quite clear that there is no such power in District Court to intervene at this stage for that purpose.","start":542.82,"stop":551.246,"duration":8.43},{"text":"I think the military justice system has a freedom from intervention on such matter similar to that that the state justice systems have and that intervention is justified only when as Younger against Harris would put it -- various bad-faith or harassment and when the party seeking relief is threatened with irreparable injury that is both great in immediate.","start":551.246,"stop":575.307,"duration":24.06},{"text":"And this case, the District Court made no such findings as a precondition of its intervention and indeed bad faith or harassment were not even alleged.","start":575.307,"stop":585.708,"duration":10.4},{"text":"The fact that the appellee might have to be confined pending the outcome of the military prosecution in any appeals that follow does not constitute, it’s not cognizable as an irreparable injury that's an incident of any criminal process.","start":585.708,"stop":600.526,"duration":14.82},{"text":"And if that were grounds for intervention, federal courts would be intervening all of the time in state and military justice appeals systems.","start":600.526,"stop":608.991,"duration":8.47},{"text":"I think the decision of this Court rather uniformly show that this rule against intervention by Article III Courts in military proceedings as in state proceedings rest upon a cluster of policy factors.","start":608.991,"stop":620.946,"duration":11.96},{"text":"I think some of them are of constitutional dimension and they’re summed up generally in the word exhaustion of remedies and comity.","start":620.946,"stop":628.304,"duration":7.36},{"text":"And I think these policies are so strong indeed that the appellee has not been able to point to a single decision of this Court sanctioning an intrusion like this one into the military justice system.","start":628.304,"stop":638.853,"duration":10.55},{"text":"It’s an intrusion both unique and as continuing because the terms the District Court’s order contain words which must be construed and the District Court could hold itself available for application to continue to supervise the access to document’s problem.","start":638.853,"stop":655.925,"duration":17.07},{"text":"And all of that takes place before the appellee has even been tried much less exhausted his remedies within the military justice system.","start":655.925,"stop":663.611,"duration":7.69},{"text":"Now, let me say here that a great deal of the argument in this brief rest upon I think unjustified denigration of the military justice system.","start":663.611,"stop":671.283,"duration":7.67},{"text":"There is much argument in the brief in the appellee’s brief that military tribunals do not apply all of the procedures that civilian tribunals do which is quite true but that is not a statement that military tribunals are in anyway lax in applying those procedures which this Court and Congress has an appropriate for them.","start":671.283,"stop":690.248,"duration":18.97},{"text":"Similarly, I think in an effort to avoid the plain thrust of cases like Gusik against Schilder and Younger against Harris.","start":690.248,"stop":697.742,"duration":7.49},{"text":"The appellee has tried to argue that any remedy he may have in the military system will be futile.","start":697.742,"stop":704.064,"duration":6.32},{"text":"And that seems to me a very hard claim for a man who’s been convicted ones by a court martial on an espionage charge and has appealed that conviction and has had it reversed by the Court of Military Review and has had that reversal sustained by the Court of Military Appeals.","start":704.064,"stop":719.252,"duration":15.19},{"text":"His real complaint is that he has made three successive petitions for extraordinary relief prior to a second trial and that the Court of Military Appeals has denied them and said that that is extraordinary relief and is not to be use as a substitute for appeal.","start":719.252,"stop":735.121,"duration":15.87},{"text":"There's no reason here to think that should he be convicted upon a second court martial that the Court of Military Appeals and indeed the entire military appellate system would not be fully sensitive to his constitutional claims.","start":735.121,"stop":748.438,"duration":13.32},{"text":"I will discuss only briefly this Court’s opinion in Gusik against Schilder which is really a much stronger case for intervention by Article III Courts because the man there -- the serviceman there had been convicted and had exhausted all of his military remedies.","start":748.438,"stop":764.659,"duration":16.22},{"text":"Afterwards, a new article gave him the right to ask for a discretionary new trial to be given by the Judge Advocate General and that was the only remedy available to him and his chances didn’t look very good, but this Court said that habeas corpus was not available to him until he had exhausted that remedy.","start":764.659,"stop":785.325,"duration":20.67},{"text":"It seems to me that he had a much slimmer chance and adequate remedy at law than does the appellee here.","start":785.325,"stop":797.181,"duration":11.86},{"text":"The Gusik case itself analogized the requirement of exhaustion of military remedies to the similar requirement of exhaustion of remedies within state court systems and I guess Younger against Harris recently decided by this Court shows the strength of that requirement.","start":797.181,"stop":812.143,"duration":14.96},{"text":"There, it was a prosecution of a man under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act, an act of dubious constitutionality and he raised the First Amendment claim.","start":812.143,"stop":821.978,"duration":9.83},{"text":"It would seem to me much more compelling than the appellee’s claim here because his conduct alleged is espionage which does not fall under any constitutionally protected area.","start":821.978,"stop":833.971,"duration":11.99},{"text":"But I think if one analyzes Younger and this case will find them parallel in many respects, there is here not the policy of federalism which Younger found important but there is the constitutional power of Congress to make rules for the Armed Forces which are separate.","start":833.971,"stop":849.68,"duration":15.71},{"text":"There is a same document of equity jurisprudence against restraining criminal prosecutions.","start":849.68,"stop":854.451,"duration":4.77},{"text":"There is the same adequate remedy of law and there's the same absence of a showing of irreparable injury.","start":854.451,"stop":860.57,"duration":6.12},{"text":"There is the same need I think to avoid friction and to avoid disruption of the court martial.","start":860.57,"stop":867.216,"duration":6.65},{"text":"I think in considering this case, one ought to consider what the general principle at stake is.","start":867.216,"stop":872.726,"duration":5.51},{"text":"The general principle is really one that would commence a general removal power from courts martial for constitutional issues.","start":872.726,"stop":882.372,"duration":9.65},{"text":"And the court below when appellee here say that since military courts do not have special expertise on such issues, there is no reason to let them decide them without having a federal court intervene to decide them for them.","start":882.372,"stop":894.256,"duration":11.88},{"text":"That would shell the cases back and forth between the Article III system and the military system in a way that it would be so disruptive and so costly for everybody concerned.","start":894.256,"stop":901.507,"duration":7.25},{"text":"It would be better if the Article III Court simply took over court martial rather than did that.","start":901.507,"stop":908.068,"duration":6.56},{"text":"Now the only reply, the appellee has to all of these occurred I think the heart of his reply is at page 51 of his brief where he strides a string of cases, Billings against Truesdell, Toth against Quarles, Reid against Covert, McElroy agianst Guagliardo, and he cites those for the proposition that this Court has repeatedly sanctioned interference with on going military proceedings to correct fundamental of the constitutional errors.","start":908.068,"stop":936.739,"duration":28.67},{"text":"And I think not, I think not those are all cases in which the person seeking to have a federal court intervene successfully claimed not to be a member of the Armed Forces.","start":936.739,"stop":950.319,"duration":13.58},{"text":"The integrity of the military trial process was not at stake and the intervention to prevent the court martial a person who is not even subject to military law is hardly the same kind of disruption.","start":950.319,"stop":965.468,"duration":15.15},{"text":"In fact, those cases can be decided by the status of the person.","start":965.468,"stop":969.4,"duration":3.93},{"text":"He is a civilian not a military in person and then a further legal question of, may a court martial constitutionally try a civilian under these circumstances which is not all the same of taking a person who is concededly subject to court-martial jurisdiction concededly subject to trial and constantly filtering his constitutional claims out of the military system into the federal system perhaps for full appeal and then back into the military system again.","start":969.4,"stop":997.876,"duration":28.48},{"text":"So far as I can make out that’s about all there is to the appellee’s case that it is a constitutional issue and therefore there's no reason why should at the military courts decide before the civilian courts do.","start":997.876,"stop":1011.698,"duration":13.82},{"text":"And we’ve seen that the intention of Congress and all of the policy considerations underlying this Court’s decisions run to the contrary.","start":1011.698,"stop":1019.4,"duration":7.7},{"text":"There is one thing perhaps I should mention and that is that appellees brief mounts in extents of attack upon the constitutionality of Article 76 of the Code which is the finality provision and says that it’s unconstitutional if it’s interpreted to mean that the only collateral attack possible upon a military conviction is by habeas corpus by persons in confinement.","start":1019.4,"stop":1044.303,"duration":24.9},{"text":"That gets the appellee into Martin against Hunter’s Lessee and Ex parte McCardle in a very exciting group of cases to teach but I think not relevant for today’s discussion.","start":1044.303,"stop":1055.202,"duration":10.9},{"text":"We cite Article 76 as evidence of congressional intent that the court martial system be generally free in interference, it clearly is that.","start":1055.202,"stop":1064.303,"duration":9.1},{"text":"We have argued that habeas corpus is the only permissible form of collateral attack but that’s not necessary for decision of the present case because whatever form of collateral attack maybe available Younger against Harris and Gusik against Schilder for the proposition that it takes place after the exhaustion of remedies in the military system.","start":1064.303,"stop":1079.874,"duration":15.57}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
