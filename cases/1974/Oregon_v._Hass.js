here.","start":364.964,"stop":379.279,"duration":14.31},{"text":"Basically, it involves the theft of a bicycle out of the garage of a resident in Klamath Falls, Oregon.","start":379.279,"stop":385.755,"duration":6.48},{"text":"The owner of the bicycle and his father saw the thief who was we think it clear now defendant's accomplice drive the bicycle or ride the bicycle out of the driveway.","start":385.755,"stop":396.359,"duration":10.6},{"text":"They gave a chase.","start":396.359,"stop":397.643,"duration":1.28},{"text":"They ultimately intercepted the

that call, a state police officer traced the Volkswagen bus and went to the defendant’s home.","start":409.29,"stop":418.191,"duration":8.9},{"text":"He advised him of his Miranda Rights and his advice incidentally included a specific warning that the defendant could stop talking at any time.","start":418.191,"stop":428.002,"duration":9.81},{"text":"In addition to the usual fourfold right to remain silent etcetera has admitted that he had taken two bicycles that day and he wasn’t sure which one the officer was talking about.","start":428.002,"stop":440.668,"duration":12.67},{"text":"Upon further conversation, he said that he had given one bicycle back which I gather his interpretation of the incident with the father and son demanding it back and that he had concealed the other and he agreed to show the officer where he had concealed the second bicycle.","start":440.668,"stop":460.689,"duration":20.02},{"text":"On the way to the spot where the second bicycle was concealed however has with already admitted his guilt in the offense to this extent indicated and the exact wording he used is a little bit in dispute the two versions are set forth in the petitioner’s brief indicated that he would like to consult with an attorney.","start":460.689,"stop":479.644,"duration":18.95},{"text":"The officer said that he couldn't make counsel available to him right then.","start":479.644,"stop":484.788,"duration":5.14},{"text":"However, he would make counsel available or at least a phone would be provided to him as soon as they got to the state police headquarters.","start":484.788,"stop":494.527,"duration":9.74},{"text":"According to the officer in response to a specific question from Hass he then said that he was not going to force Hass to continue with the investigation but he would like to clear the matter off.","start":494.527,"stop":506.398,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Now, Hass' version of the events as that the officer said, “I can't let you see a lawyer but I'll let you when we get down to the station.","start":506.398,"stop":514.046,"duration":7.65},{"text":"And even Hass' version of the events does not claim that there was any greater degree of coercion or pressure put upon him than that.","start":514.046,"stop":523.924,"duration":9.88},{"text":"In any event, they went to the spot where the second bicycle was recovered and it turned out to have been taken from another residence in the same general area at approximately the same time.","start":523.924,"stop":535.294,"duration":11.37},{"text":"There was no evidence in the record indicating specifically that the bicycle had been taken the same day except for the defendant's later testimony to that effect.","start":535.294,"stop":546.125,"duration":10.83},{"text":"There was an in camera hearing to determine whether or not ought the police officer's testimony would be admissible with respect to everything that the defendant has it said and done at the time of this interrogation or this questioning.","start":546.125,"stop":563.973,"duration":17.85},{"text":"After hearing, the testimony the trial court ruled that everything has did and said and in fact defense counsel conceded this that everything has did and said up to the time he inquired about the availability of counsel would be clearly admissible.","start":563.973,"stop":578.888,"duration":14.92},{"text":"But that this inquiry brought Miranda into play and that nothing else would be admissible in the states case in chief and nothing else was admitted in states case in chief.","start":578.888,"stop":590.241,"duration":11.35},{"text":"Has then took to stand and testified that he and two other fellows have been driving around the general area where the bicycles were taken that the other two person had taken the bicycles without his prior knowledge and that he didn't know exactly where they came from.","start":590.241,"stop":608.117,"duration":17.88},{"text":"This was all they did on the direct examination.","start":608.117,"stop":612.211,"duration":4.09},{"text":"In short, he admits his part in the theft of the bicycles in the sense of receiving and concealing the stolen property.","start":612.211,"stop":619.359,"duration":7.15},{"text":"He conceded that he figured they were stolen from the way his two friends brought them to him but he claimed that he had no prior knowledge of the crime.","start":619.359,"stop":626.609,"duration":7.25},{"text":"And that he therefore wasn’t guilty of the burglary with which he was charged.","start":626.609,"stop":631.05,"duration":4.44},{"text":"And this is particularly significant in Oregon or it was particularly significant still is actually because Oregon some months before the trial in this case have adopted a same transaction test of determining when jeopardy attaches and it is very probable under the teachings of that particular case which was State versus Brown and again cited in the brief that had the jury believe passes testimony and acquitted him of the burglary charge double jeopardy as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Oregon construing the Oregon Constitution would have barred a second trial for the theft at which he then admitted his guilt.","start":631.05,"stop":670.426,"duration":39.38},{"text":"Well, in rebuttal to Hass' testimony after the case of Harris versus New York was called of the trial court's attention.","start":670.426,"stop":677.367,"duration":6.94},{"text":"The state recalled the state police officer who testified that after he had obtained the admissions from Hass that he had previously testified to, Hass had taken him around to the residential area where the bicycles were taken and that Hass had pointed out the precise locations of the two houses from which those bicycles had been taken.","start":677.367,"stop":699.347,"duration":21.98},{"text":"The Court then instructed the jury that this testimony was to be received only for impeachment purposes and then on surrebuttal has went ahead to deny that he had pointed out the houses in question.","start":699.347,"stop":712.424,"duration":13.08},{"text":"There's very little I can say about this case because basically when we get to the legal issues presented because it seems to me that it comes so clearly within the parameters of Harris that it's almost pointless to draw the distinctions that Oregon Supreme Court did.","start":712.424,"stop":733.924,"duration":21.5},{"text":"In the first place here as before, we have as in Harris we have the defendant affirmatively stating on the direct examination testimony that he know -- when he knows that the state is not going to be able to present contrary testimony at least in this case in chief and wasn't able to do it.","start":733.924,"stop":753.846,"duration":19.92},{"text":"They knew that this testimony existed and they knew that they have been ruled and admissible.","start":753.846,"stop":758.091,"duration":4.25},{"text":"It seems that this presents in this kind of context I'm not necessarily saying that it happened here that we have a marvelous opportunity for criminal defendants to tailor their testimony in accordance to account for anything they may have said prior to the time they may have asked for counsel under the circumstances of this case.","start":758.091,"stop":779.09,"duration":21},{"text":"There is no contention as I have mentioned before that anything Hass' statements or what he did was in fact coerced or involuntary or that any pressure was put on him.","start":779.09,"stop":789.713,"duration":10.62},{"text":"He have been advised of this Miranda Rights, he have been told he could stop answering questions at any time, he asked for a lawyer -- the lawyer he was told that counsel would be made available to him when he got the police station.","start":789.713,"stop":802.526,"duration":12.81},{"text":"And that's it he doesn't claim that there was any coercion at all put upon him to continue beyond the mere request of the officer.","start":802.526,"stop":810.847,"duration":8.32},{"text":"This we submit is enough to satisfy the primer and the standards of voluntariness and trustworthiness which would render the statements he made and the things he did after he inquired about the availability of counsel admissible at least for impeachment purposes.","start":810.847,"stop":829.739,"duration":18.89},{"text":"As I've noted in a footnote it seems to be an open question yet at least this Court hasn't directly spoken on the issue of whether advise of rights which tells an accuse that counsel will be made available to him at a later time such as when and if you go to court was one example makes the statements inadmissible in the case in chief.","start":829.739,"stop":848.72,"duration":18.98},{"text":"We're not contesting this because the argument wasn't raised below and I don't feel that I'm entitled to make the contention here that the statements has that were admissible in the case in chief nor do I need to.","start":848.72,"stop":861.407,"duration":12.69},{"text":"But it certainly seems to me that this kind of statement should be made and should be admissible for impeachment purposes under the facts of this case particularly where as again here the jury was carefully instructed that the statements were limited to impeachment and were not to be considered in determining the guilt or innocence of Hass per se.","start":861.407,"stop":886.008,"duration":24.6}]},{"speakerName":"William J.
