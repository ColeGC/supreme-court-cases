facts.","start":218.611,"stop":221.604,"duration":2.99},{"text":"He stipulated, among other things, that he possessed the marijuana with intent to distribute, and the stipulation contained a proviso

motion.”","start":221.604,"stop":237.85,"duration":16.25},{"text":"The District Court found the respondent guilty and sentenced him to prison term of one year and one day subject to immediate parole

effect.","start":259.209,"stop":275.534,"duration":16.32},{"text":"The majority in the Court of Appeals held that it need not reach the retroactivity issue because, in its view, Almeida-Sanchez did

searches.","start":286.471,"stop":306.942,"duration":20.47},{"text":"The majority also conceded that, in 1970, it had upheld the roving patrol search in its decision in United States against Miranda and again in Almeida-Sanchez itself.","start":306.942,"stop":319.141,"duration":12.2},{"text":"It also noted that the Tenth Circuit had uphold-- upheld a roving patrol search in Roa-Rodriguez, but the

Circuit also reached the opposite result in United States against Bowen.","start":346.336,"stop":352.874,"duration":6.54},{"text":"The only difference between Bowen and this case is that Bowen involved the checkpoint search and, there, the majority, again by a 7-6 vote, founded Almeida-Sanchez had overruled clear past precedent.","start":352.874,"stop":365.763,"duration":12.89},{"text":"The Tenth Circuit has given Almeida-Sanchez retroactive effect in the case of checkpoint searches and, presumably, it would give a retroactive effect in the case of roving patrol searches.","start":365.763,"stop":378.901,"duration":13.14},{"text":"We submit that Almeida-Sanchez did, indeed, establish a new rule that overruled past Court of Appeals precedent and a long-established practice and-- that under principles of this Court's retroactivity decisions and other principles of exclusionary rule policy itself, Almeida-Sanchez should not be given retroactive effect, that is it should not apply to searches conducted before June 21, 1973, the date on which it was decided.","start":378.901,"stop":410.128,"duration":31.23},{"text":"Support for roving patrol searches prior to Almeida-Sanchez was both judicial and statutory.","start":410.128,"stop":417.257,"duration":7.13},{"text":"Section 1357 of Title 8 authorized Immigration and Naturalization Service officers without a warrant, within a reasonable distance from any external border of the United States, to board and search any vehicle or conveyance for illegal aliens.","start":417.257,"stop":437.301,"duration":20.04},{"text":"In regulations promulgate under the statute, the Attorney General had defined a reasonable distance from the border to be any point within 100 air-miles from an external boundary.","start":437.301,"stop":449.736,"duration":12.44},{"text":"And, we believe that the statute alone, in the absence of a contrary judicial construction, would be sufficient basis for reliance by law enforcement officers and would present a retroactivity question and, that, we believe is the thrust of this Court's plurality opinion in Lemon against Kurtzman, declining to give retroactive effect to its prior decision holding a Pennsylvania statute unconstitutional that provided public aid to non-public sectarian schools.","start":449.736,"stop":480.764,"duration":31.03},{"text":"But, we do not rely on the statute alone because the unconstitutionality of the statute was upheld in numerous decisions in the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits.","start":480.764,"stop":492.03,"duration":11.27},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit distinguished many of these cases as dicta, as I said, presumably on the ground that they involved checkpoint searches, but the language in those decisions was not so limited.","start":492.03,"stop":505.797,"duration":13.77},{"text":"And, prior to Almeida-Sanchez, there was no distinction drawn in the case law between checkpoint searches and roving patrol searches, and the majority of the Ninth Circuit conceded that its cases contained language from which the government might infer that roving patrol searches would be upheld and that, of course, is precisely what happened.","start":505.797,"stop":527.464,"duration":21.67},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit upheld roving patrol searches in Miranda and Almeida-Sanchez, the Tenth Circuit in its decision in United States against Roa-Rodriguez, and the Fifth Circuit in its decision in United States against Miller.","start":527.464,"stop":541.788,"duration":14.32},{"text":"Mr. Justice Powell's concurring opinion in Almeida-Sanchez recognized this consistent judicial approval.","start":541.788,"stop":548.769,"duration":6.98},{"text":"He wrote the roving automobile searches in border regions for aliens had been consistently approved by the judiciary, and Mr. Justice White's dissenting opinion also recognized this prior judicial approval for he observed that the Courts have consistently and almost without dissent come to the same conclusion that is embodied in the judgment that is reversed today.Respondent himself recognized, at the time of his suppression motion, that the state of the law sustained roving patrol stops and searches for concealed illegal aliens.","start":548.769,"stop":586.621,"duration":37.85},{"text":"In the District Court, he contended that while it was permissible to stop and search for aliens, once border patrol agents discovered no illegal aliens, they then were required to go no further even though they observed the marijuana in the trunk of the car.","start":586.621,"stop":605.246,"duration":18.63},{"text":"For example, at page 23 of the appendix, respondent's counsel say to the Court “now, if Agent Ansco had felt the bag to see if there was an alien in there, I would say, fine, we do not have an illegal search and seizure.”","start":605.246,"stop":621.857,"duration":16.61},{"text":"Respondent did ask that his case be stayed pending this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez, but that is simply recognition that he needed a change in the law.","start":621.857,"stop":633.474,"duration":11.62},{"text":"The only additional factors which could be required are either a prior decision by Court or additional Court of Appeals opinions, but neither requirement is sound.","start":633.474,"stop":646.25,"duration":12.78},{"text":"There is no support in this Court's decisions for the proposition that a decision must overrule a prior precedent of this Court before a retroactivity issue is presented.","start":646.25,"stop":658.7,"duration":12.45},{"text":"In Chevron Oil against Huson, for example, this Court declined to give retroactive effect to Rodriguez against setting a casualty even though Rodriguez had overruled only a long line of Fifth Circuit
