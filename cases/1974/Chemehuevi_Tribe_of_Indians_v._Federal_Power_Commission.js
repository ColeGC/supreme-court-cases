environmental organizations and several individuals brought a proceeding in the Federal Power Commission seeking to require the intervening companies to apply for licenses for six existing and planned thermal-electric facilities in the so-called Four Corners area of the Southwest, all of which draw their cooling waters from various places in the Colorado River System but none of which draw their cooling waters from any project licensed by the Federal Power Commission.","start":38.724,"stop":92.775,"duration":54.05},{"text":"The claim was made that the Commission has jurisdiction, licensing jurisdiction over these plants both under the so-called project works clause and because the plants use surplus water from government dams or at least arguably some of them do.","start":92.775,"stop":117.161,"duration":24.39},{"text":"The Commission dismissed the complaint on the basis of its longstanding interpretation that part one of the Act gives a jurisdiction to license only hydroelectric facilities and not thermal-electric facilities whether they're fossil-fueled burning facilities or atomic facilities.","start":117.161,"stop":145.2,"duration":28.04},{"text":"That the jurisdiction under both clauses of the Act is limited to the licensing of project works or the use of surplus water by hydroelectric facilities which use water power for the generation of electricity, the power of falling water.","start":145.2,"stop":168.947,"duration":23.75},{"text":"On review, the Court of Appeals agreed with the Commission in rejecting the principal contention that was being made in the case under the project works clause but how did the Commission does have licensing authority with respect to the use of surplus water by thermal-electric plants and ordered the case remanded to the Commission to determine whether surplus water within the meaning of the statute was being used by these facilities and the relationship between the Commission's jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of other federal agencies who have the authority over the disposition of the water at the various projects involved in the Colorado system.","start":168.947,"stop":227.375,"duration":58.43},{"text":"This Court granted cross-petitions for certiorari and by agreement of the parties, the opening briefs on all issues were filed by the Power Commission and the intervenor companies and I will be speaking for 20 minutes for the Power Commission and Mr. Ely will be speaking for 10 minutes for the intervenor companies.","start":227.375,"stop":250.375,"duration":23},{"text":"At the outset, now the issue has not been contested in this Court before is not a new issue in this Court.","start":250.375,"stop":265.853,"duration":15.48},{"text":"In 1965, in a case titled Federal Power Commission against Union Electric Company, in volume 381 U.S., all nine justices addressed the issue in the context of determining whether there was jurisdiction in the Commission to license a pumped-storage plant and the case was decided on the premise that the Commission has no licensing jurisdiction with respect to thermal-electric facilities, a premise that was accepted by all parties in that case.","start":265.853,"stop":312.96,"duration":47.11},{"text":"And previously, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, an opinion of this Court in 1953, United States against Public Utilities Commission, and this is explained in the appendix on page 89 (a) and footnote 123 that opinion of this Court by Mr. Justice Reed was written on the assumption that the Commission has no licensing jurisdiction with respect to thermal-electric facilities.","start":312.96,"stop":347.308,"duration":34.35},{"text":"Nonetheless, at the outset of the complainants argue in this Court that the plain meaning of the statute precludes the interpretation of the Act to which all nine justices subscribed in the Union Electric case and which was also reflected in the opinion in the Public Utilities Commission case by Mr. Justice Reed.","start":347.308,"stop":380.176,"duration":32.87},{"text":"This obviously is a difficult argument to make but it's being made in the context of a statute in which the legislative history is quite devastating to the position that they are espousing.","start":380.176,"stop":404.68,"duration":24.5},{"text":"In our brief, and more elaborately in the intervenor's brief, we've addressed the problems with the language of the Act and why the language can be construed and perhaps more reasonably should be construed on its face in favor of our interpretation of the Act and the interpretation previously reflected in the Court's opinions.","start":404.68,"stop":432.906,"duration":28.23},{"text":"I don't propose to rehearse that during the argument because it seems to us too late in the day after 54 years of interpretation by the Commission after pronouncements and opinions of this Court, after a major reenactment by Congress in 1935 in light of the Commission's interpretations for us to think that this issue can be decided on the bare words of the statute without looking beyond them.","start":432.906,"stop":471.723,"duration":38.82},{"text":"And I might say after widespread reliance during those 54 years by not only the industry but by our consumers of electric power.","start":471.723,"stop":484.145,"duration":12.42},{"text":"And so, I think the Court of Appeals was quite right in examining the legislative history in detail as it did with respect to the contention under the project works clause and basically we're in agreement with that aspect of the Court of Appeals' opinion and analysis which showed that the original part one of the Federal Power Act which was called the Federal Water Power Act was in its antecedents and in its enactment, concerned exclusively with giving Federal Licensing Authority over the development of hydroelectric power.","start":484.145,"stop":534.071,"duration":49.93},{"text":"The dominant concern in the enactment of the legislation was to foster the maximum development and utilization of hydroelectric power so as to minimize the extent to which fossil fuels would have to be consumed in the production of power and pollution would occur from the burning of fossil fuels.","start":534.071,"stop":561.289,"duration":27.22},{"text":"It was assumed by everyone that the need was to give the regulatory jurisdiction with respect to the hydroelectric facilities to assure that the potential of the waters wouldn't be wasted by short-sided development or by development at one point that wouldn't enable maximum utilization at other points in the river system.","start":561.289,"stop":589.642,"duration":28.35},{"text":"And there were also concerns that excessive profits might be made by the utilization of the hydroelectric sites because it was cheaper to produce the electric power by this method and there was also the possibility of making excessive profits at the time the license is expired and the facilities were converted and so safeguards replaced in the law with respect to that aspect of it as well.","start":589.642,"stop":622.589,"duration":32.95},{"text":"And if you just side the highlights from subsequent developments starting in 1921 in its first annual report to Congress and repeatedly to the series of annual reports, the Commission, the Federal Power Commission indicated that its jurisdiction, under the act, not merely under the project works clause, I should say, but under the act was limited to hydroelectric facilities.","start":622.589,"stop":659.369,"duration":36.78},{"text":"And there was indication that Congress was well aware of this when they reenacted Federal Water Power Act as the part one of the Federal power Act in 1935 and that Congress deliberately decided not to expand Commission licensing jurisdiction at that time.","start":659.369,"stop":683.679,"duration":24.31},{"text":"This is recounted in some detail, this portion of the legislative history on page 8 of the

part of the Commission for adequacy and reliability of power service.","start":875.473,"stop":892.949,"duration":17.48},{"text":"At present, there is no agency which has centralized authority to consider alternative sites for new thermal plants and to authorize a particular site to the exclusion of any other regulatory jurisdiction.","start":892.949,"stop":909.947,"duration":17},{"text":"As a

blackouts.","start":909.947,"stop":926.508,"duration":16.56},{"text":"Under the Court of Appeals' holding, the Commission would not have authority in authorizing the use of surplus water to preempt other regulatory agency, state or federal from the siting question, it would merely be an additional obstacle that would have to be overcome to the resolution of where particular plant that's needed can be built.","start":926.508,"stop":952.322,"duration":25.81},{"text":"So we wouldn't be having a resolution of what the Commission sees as needed under the surplus water

opinion.","start":962.524,"stop":971.179,"duration":8.65},{"text":"I should turn to their holding on the surplus water clause.","start":971.179,"stop":976.178,"duration":5},{"text":"The first thing to be said about it is that most of the legislative history applies equally to the surplus water clause which was in the Act from the outset and which was included in the Commission's generic reports that it lacks a jurisdiction over thermal-electric facilities.","start":976.178,"stop":998.452,"duration":22.27},{"text":"Sometimes the reports would specify under part one of the Federal Power Act which was obviously included the surplus water clause.","start":998.452,"stop":1007.5,"duration":9.05},{"text":"Indeed, if and the Court of Appeals of course did not have the benefit of the very compendious history of that particular clause which the intervenors have compiled in their supplemental brief which is very helpful in showing the antecedence of the clause which indicate that it was tied in very specifically with hydroelectric development.","start":1007.5,"stop":1033.964,"duration":26.46},{"text":"The other thing in our view may have mislead the Court of Appeals on this question is the fact that the litigation focused so much on Section 4 (e).","start":1033.964,"stop":1045.031,"duration":11.07},{"text":"In the appendix in our brief on page 63, we have set forth Section 23 (b) of the Act which probably is the Section of the complaint should have been brought under because that is the Section that says who is required to get a license.","start":1045.031,"stop":1065.648,"duration":20.62},{"text":"Section 4 (e) simply says what authority the Commission has to issue a license.","start":1065.648,"stop":1071.742,"duration":6.09},{"text":"Obviously, the two have to be read together.","start":1071.742,"stop":1074.15,"duration":2.41},{"text":"But Section 23 (b) on page 63 indicates quite clearly on the face of the Act that there is very little warrant for reading the two clauses differently since it says it shall be unlawful for any person, state or municipality for the purpose of developing electric power to construct project works or to use surplus water.","start":1074.15,"stop":1103.293,"duration":29.14},{"text":"And it's rather hard to see why the words for the purpose of developing electric power would not be read the same with respect to both clauses.","start":1103.293,"stop":1112.611,"duration":9.32},{"text":"It's the operational words that, in light of the legislative background indicate a limitation of the Commission's jurisdiction to hydroelectric facilities.","start":1112.611,"stop":1125.841,"duration":13.23},{"text":"Now, the argument is made that under this reading of Section 23 (b) and of the similar authority in Section 4 (e), the surplus water clause becomes redundant and superfluous and loses any function.","start":1125.841,"stop":1145.948,"duration":20.11},{"text":"In reflecting on this matter in preparing the argument, the things to ask that the most apparent function of the surplus water clause on the face of the Act, again is reflected in Section 23 (b) on which the litigation did not focus.","start":1145.948,"stop":1163.957,"duration":18.01},{"text":"And I'm sorry this point was not made in the briefs but its there on the face of the Act.","start":1163.957,"stop":1171.038,"duration":7.08},{"text":"And that is the fact that Section 23 (b) has a grandfathering provision for any facilities that were built under a grant prior to June 10, 1920.","start":1171.038,"stop":1188.567,"duration":17.53},{"text":"That would by enlarge statutory grants, special statutory grants for existing facilities.","start":1188.567,"stop":1196.424,"duration":7.86},{"text":"And the Commission -- on the Commission's long standing position endorsed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a case called Northwest Paper Company against the Power Commission, 344 F.2d 47 is that the grandfathering clause is an authorization for facilities existing at that date to continue operation without a license from the Commission so long as none of the projects works a replace without a license under the project works clause.","start":1196.424,"stop":1236.735,"duration":40.31},{"text":"But then in the event and the Commission has not had occasion to actually apply this in the event the dam would be built subsequently upstream from which surplus water would flow to this project, there would be Commission jurisdiction only under the surplus water clause so that the entire river system would be brought under regulation to maximize the hydroelectric potential of the entire system because obviously the flow has to be regulated from one project to another to maximize the utilization of all of them.","start":1236.735,"stop":1274.793,"duration":38.06},{"text":"And similarly, the surplus water or water power seems to us just to refer to either the use of the surplus water or water power seems to us just to refer to either the use of the surplus water downstream or the surplus water power at the site where it is falling, the dam itself.","start":1274.793,"stop":1289.38,"duration":14.59}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Its use is for cooling purposes and is the water consumed or is it all returned at a
