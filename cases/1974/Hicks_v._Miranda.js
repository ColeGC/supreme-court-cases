Sears","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":299.477,"stop":302.261,"duration":2.78},{"text":"What I was trying to or attempting to point out is that in a very real sense what ex parte Young did was to take away a suit against the Attorney General of the state or state officer in which the declaration or a statute is being attacked for unconstitutionality from the original jurisdiction provision inherent in the Constitution which states that whenever the state is a party to a proceeding the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is original jurisdiction.","start":302.261,"stop":352.846,"duration":50.58},{"text":"It was to remedy this particular ill that in 1911 the original three-judge court provisions were enacted.","start":352.846,"stop":364.789,"duration":11.94},{"text":"I think the -- probably the clearest showing of the intent of Congress at that time to provide full direct appeal in all of those cases where a decision was to be made by the three-judge court and where a finding of unconstitutionality was added, is found in the original provision in 1911th provision in which the three-judge court which was sought to be a panel was intended to be made up of at least of one judge plus two additional judges, at least one of whom was going to be either a Supreme Court judge or a Circuit Court judge.","start":364.789,"stop":418.732,"duration":53.94},{"text":"Now, quite obviously once the decision is issued from a three-judge court, at least one of whom but possibly two of whom are Supreme Court judges it would be rather in Congress.","start":418.732,"stop":435.618,"duration":16.89},{"text":"At that point to go to a Ninth -- or a Circuit Court to have that decision reviewed.","start":435.618,"stop":444.489,"duration":8.87},{"text":"Now, true today the Act has been modified so that it does not anymore say at least one of whom can be either a Supreme Court or a Circuit Court but it does still say at least one of whom and again at least one of whom shall be a Circuit Court judge.","start":444.489,"stop":465.733,"duration":21.24},{"text":"Arguably therefore one could have a three-judge court with two Circuit Court judges.","start":465.733,"stop":475.031,"duration":9.3},{"text":"I suppose one could go and go to the Ninth Circuit that demand a hearing and then but I would question the wisdom of trying to overrule a two-judge court decision with two judges from the Ninth Circuit sitting on it and deciding the case, it would make it somewhat in Congress.","start":475.031,"stop":502.708,"duration":27.68},{"text":"That's one of the points.","start":502.708,"stop":504.213,"duration":1.5},{"text":"The other point is that interestingly enough the Act does not say prohibit.","start":504.213,"stop":512.476,"duration":8.26},{"text":"It defines injunction within the Act.","start":512.476,"stop":515.24,"duration":2.76},{"text":"It says an injunction to restrain the enforcement and so on and so forth.","start":515.24,"stop":522.835,"duration":7.6},{"text":"It would restrain as this Court has recognized does not mean to just prohibit.","start":522.835,"stop":528.259,"duration":5.42},{"text":"It means anything less than an actual prohibition.","start":528.259,"stop":532.672,"duration":4.41},{"text":"It means anything which makes it difficult, which inhibits.","start":532.672,"stop":538.892,"duration":6.22},{"text":"I think this is true of the First Amendment cases and of all cases.","start":538.892,"stop":544.067,"duration":5.17},{"text":"It's certainly true that a bill quia timet for indeed that is what declaratory judgment is a restraint especially in view of some of the new decisions which have stated that recently I believe it was the Second Circuit or the Third Circuit stated that a -- after the declaratory judgment, a proceeding against the person involved contrary to the declaration of unconstitutionality was automatically an action which was in bad faith.","start":544.067,"stop":586.156,"duration":42.09},{"text":"Now, had I read that opinion, I would have been a lot more cautious if before ever bringing a state proceeding after the declaration of the three-judge court.","start":586.156,"stop":602.187,"duration":16.03},{"text":"So long as that opinion exists, I am restrained in the future from ever doing it again, even though in good faith I believe I am right.","start":602.187,"stop":614.591,"duration":12.4},{"text":"I still couldn't.","start":614.591,"stop":616.158,"duration":1.57},{"text":"So it is a real restraint.","start":616.158,"stop":619.032,"duration":2.87},{"text":"Finally, if we speak about a case in which the three-judge court is properly convened and if -- excuse me, and if we have a valid request for injunction and if the request for injunction is denied but the declaratory relief is granted.","start":619.032,"stop":645.079,"duration":26.05},{"text":"What are the results?","start":645.079,"stop":646.824,"duration":1.75},{"text":"The practical result is that the state who is the one that was sought to be protected, whose procedures was not to be speeded all the way to this Court will be the one defendant that will not be able to reach this Court directly.","start":646.824,"stop":669.054,"duration":22.23},{"text":"Whereas, if the relief had been denied, all of it and the Act had been found constitutional, the defendant, the individual, would be able to come directly to this Court.","start":669.054,"stop":686.425,"duration":17.37},{"text":"And I think this inconsistency is -- was not intended.","start":686.425,"stop":692.955,"duration":6.53},{"text":"I think that a declaration of unconstitutionality unless this Court is willing to say that beyond 1201 we take 1202 and destroy it.","start":692.955,"stop":705.17,"duration":12.21},{"text":"It is there.","start":705.17,"stop":706.647,"duration":1.48},{"text":"A Court who has the power to issue declaration also has the power to enforce that declaration under 1201 and probably within the purview of 2283 as well.","start":706.647,"stop":720.683,"duration":14.04},{"text":"And it seems to me that then in that case we have a bypassing of the totality of the procedures.","start":720.683,"stop":729.102,"duration":8.42},{"text":"Now, a point that is also somewhat important is the fact that there is another strength, there is a possibly res judicata restraint.","start":729.102,"stop":745.721,"duration":16.62},{"text":"Now, that too is a restraint because if the state court feels that -- if the people feel that the declaratory judgment is going to be res judicata in the state court really there isn't much point in bringing the proceeding.","start":745.721,"stop":763.102,"duration":17.38},{"text":"So therefore, I would submit that if we are going to allow a declaratory judgment to be given in these cases and I think we have to, I don't think that's open for question then I think that the Court must preserve the rights to appeal by declaring that the declaratory judgment is per se in these type of cases injunctive and that it restraints.","start":763.102,"stop":791.603,"duration":28.5},{"text":"The second point of course is that both of these as far as the first order, the order to return it's obvious under the Ledesma rationale that it is injunctive but the second order is probably even more injunctive to my mind.","start":791.603,"stop":811.207,"duration":19.6},{"text":"It opens me to a contempt to which I almost find inescapable.","start":811.207,"stop":817.153,"duration":5.95},{"text":"I cannot in good faith, that's the impossibility in good faith do that which I do not believe in, how do I in good faith petition my Court whom I have asked to do something and who has issued a valid order and has rendered a valid judgment.","start":817.153,"stop":838.399,"duration":21.25},{"text":"Now I have to go back and say “I don't believe I'm wrong but they tell me I have to do it in good faith so Your Honors, I will do it!”","start":838.399,"stop":846.749,"duration":8.35}]},{"speakerName":"Potter
