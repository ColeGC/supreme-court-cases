certified to the Special Court.","start":383.772,"stop":389.772,"duration":6},{"text":"The Special Court will then order the transfer out of the rail properties from the bankrupt estates to Conrail

minimum.","start":408.076,"stop":425.035,"duration":16.96},{"text":"Now that consideration given to the bankrupt estates, the rail estates, is to consist of stock and securities of Conrail and up to

the Special Court on the evaluation issue is then reviewable by this court.","start":475.85,"stop":483.496,"duration":7.65},{"text":"Now, although the constitutionality of this statutory scheme was being litigated in various reorganization courts.","start":483.496,"stop":492.32,"duration":8.82},{"text":"These cases were brought in District Courts, not reorganization courts by the Penn Central
