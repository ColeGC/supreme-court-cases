service market in Southern California and the Benton Companies combined had about 7%.","start":278.702,"stop":295.537,"duration":16.83},{"text":"Now, of course, the statute with which we deal here today, Section 7 of the Clayton Act, prohibits the acquisition by any corporation engaged in commerce of the stock or assets of another corporation, engaged also in commerce where the effect of that acquisition maybe to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.","start":295.537,"stop":320.968,"duration":25.43},{"text":"And this case involves the meaning of four words in that

raised.","start":341.651,"stop":344.645,"duration":2.99},{"text":"But the decision on the District Court was on a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the acquired firms were not corporations engaged also in commerce.","start":344.645,"stop":359.411,"duration":14.77},{"text":"The Government introduced various affidavits, none of which I think are disputed showing that Benton had provided janitorial services necessary to support the interstate operation of its customers.","start":359.411,"stop":376.205,"duration":16.79},{"text":"The Benton had purchased substantial quantities of janitorial supplies manufactured outside of California.","start":376.205,"stop":384.943,"duration":8.74},{"text":"That it negotiated at least to major contracts without a state customer

summary judgment in 1973 and in doing so, it adopted almost rebut him the findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by America but proposed prior to the time that the United States had filed its affidavits.","start":401.572,"stop":420.447,"duration":18.88},{"text":"Of course, once the Court had concluded that, it resulted in a holding that Section 7 had no application to this case.","start":420.447,"stop":433.079,"duration":12.63},{"text":"But there was however in the court below, no opinion explaining the Court's reasoning as to how it reached its conclusion.","start":433.079,"stop":445.288,"duration":12.21},{"text":"The first issue which this appeal raises and when which is easily disposed off, is whether the power of Congress could reach this kind of a transaction.","start":445.288,"stop":459.732,"duration":14.44},{"text":"This Court disposed of that question in Mandeville Island Farms against American Crystal Sugar in 1947.","start":459.732,"stop":470.729,"duration":11},{"text":"There, the question was whether an agreement by Sugar Refiners which sold sugar in interstate commerce could agree on the price.","start":470.729,"stop":483,"duration":12.27},{"text":"Whether they could agree on the price which they were going to pay to sugar beet growers located in Northern California.","start":483,"stop":492.226,"duration":9.23},{"text":"This Court in that case clearly held that such an agreement on price was an agreement which affected commerce and one that was in -- within the reach of the Sherman Act, the first antitrust statute.","start":492.226,"stop":509.124,"duration":16.9},{"text":"Now, of course, when we're dealing with the Sherman Act and with the Clayton Act, we are not dealing with the same statutes.","start":509.124,"stop":517.333,"duration":8.21},{"text":"But we are dealing with statutes in which Congress sought to address substantially the same problem, the problem of monopoly, the problem of trust, the problem of anticompetitive effects on the American economy.","start":517.333,"stop":537.208,"duration":19.88},{"text":"When Congress passed the Clayton Act in 1914, it made clear that that Act was intended to supplement the Sherman Act which Congress had enacted in 1890.","start":537.208,"stop":554.183,"duration":16.98},{"text":"In the light therefore of Mandeville farms, the holding of this Court in that case, there doesn't seem to be much question but that Congress if it so desired and intended could have made the scope of the Clayton Act equally as broad.","start":554.183,"stop":573.08,"duration":18.9},{"text":"It could have reached a merger or acquisition of the type with which we deal here.","start":573.08,"stop":579.205,"duration":6.13},{"text":"And this brings us I think down to the central issue, did Congress intend in Section 7 of the Clayton Act to exercise as it did in the Sherman Act the full extend of its power under the commerce clause?","start":579.205,"stop":597.907,"duration":18.7},{"text":"I think if one looks at the history of the antitrust laws, one can conclude only that Congress in enacting Section 7 did intend to exercise the full extent of those powers.","start":597.907,"stop":613.942,"duration":16.03},{"text":"In the Sherman Act, we have not only Mandeville farms, we have South-Eastern Underwriters in 1944 again holding that in that Act, Congress wanted to go to the full extent of its constitutional power in restraining trust agreements and in restraining monopoly agreements.","start":613.942,"stop":634.615,"duration":20.67},{"text":"And thus, given the history of that act, Senator George in 1890 stating that Sherman was ingeniously drawn to cover every case that is within the commercial power of Congress and Senator Sherman after whom the Act was of course named noting that the bill was just as broad and as sweeping and as explicit as the English language couldn't make it become then to 1914 and we see that Congress in 1914 dissatisfied and disappointed with the application of the 1890 law.","start":634.615,"stop":678.794,"duration":44.18},{"text":"We find that Congress disappointed and dissatisfied with its efforts to control trust and monopolies.","start":678.794,"stop":687.843,"duration":9.05},{"text":"And so in 1914, we find the Congress enacting a law, which according to its title was to supplement the existing laws against restraints and monopolies.","start":687.843,"stop":701.134,"duration":13.29},{"text":"The Congress in that act wanted to arrest such restraints in their incipiency and they intended to do that insofar as it was possible to do so and they did it in Section 7 of the Clayton Act.","start":701.134,"stop":718.075,"duration":16.94}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
