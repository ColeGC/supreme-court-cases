an inmate is transferred between a medium security institution and a maximum security institution, he is entitled to a due process hearing regardless of the type of transfer that is whether it's administrative or disciplinary or for any other reason.","start":14.498,"stop":37.535,"duration":23.04},{"text":"The decision of the Court of Appeals was handed down on June 3, 1974 approximately three weeks before this Court's decision in Wolff versus McDonnell.","start":37.535,"stop":47.347,"duration":9.81},{"text":"And it affirmed the decision of the Southern District of New York which had been handed down in October of 1973.","start":47.347,"stop":54.953,"duration":7.61},{"text":"The facts and circumstances in this case Your Honor are not very much in dispute at this point and essentially what took place is that on June 2, 1972 at the Wallkill Correctional Facility which is a Medium Security Institution in New York State.","start":54.953,"stop":70.046,"duration":15.09},{"text":"A group of inmates circulated the petition calling for the formation of an inmate labor union.","start":70.046,"stop":75.827,"duration":5.78},{"text":"The circulation of this petition caused a certain degree of tension and unrest of the institution because there was already in existence an Inmate Liaison Committee which had been elected by the inmates.","start":75.827,"stop":88.872,"duration":13.05},{"text":"And while the petitions were being circulated, there was a rumor that was going through the population that the Liaison Committee had supported the labor union whereas in fact that was not true.","start":88.872,"stop":99.555,"duration":10.68},{"text":"One of the members of the Liaison Committee spoke to the superintendent on the telephone.","start":99.555,"stop":103.829,"duration":4.27},{"text":"The superintendent was at his residence while the circulation was taking place and the superintendent gave this committee member permission to address the inmates on the public address system.","start":103.829,"stop":114.964,"duration":11.14},{"text":"And he advised -- this inmate advised his fellow prisoners that the Liaison Committee did not support the union and that any inmates who wish to discuss the matter could meet at a common meeting place.","start":114.964,"stop":126.822,"duration":11.86},{"text":"Such a meeting did take place, there were no fights, there was no violence but there was loud talk and inmates were trying to out shout each other.","start":126.822,"stop":136.571,"duration":9.75},{"text":"And essentially, the inmates were concerned number one with why the inmate Liaison Committee was not supporting the union and number two many of them were fearful that because the union did not have official sanction that perhaps there would be reprisals directed toward those who would sign the union petition.","start":136.571,"stop":155.599,"duration":19.03},{"text":"For the next two days after this meeting had taken place, the institution seemed to be calm at least according to the superintendent's testimony.","start":155.599,"stop":163.487,"duration":7.89},{"text":"However, he directed his deputies, his deputy superintendents to go into the population and ascertain what the situation was and it was reported back to him by his deputies that there was still a degree of tension and unrest in the population because of this potential power struggle between the Liaison Committee on one side and the union organizes on the other side.","start":163.487,"stop":185.865,"duration":22.38},{"text":"Now, Wallkill Correctional Facility is basically an open facility.","start":185.865,"stop":189.733,"duration":3.87},{"text":"There are no large cellblocks as we have in a conventional prison.","start":189.733,"stop":193.233,"duration":3.5},{"text":"There were merely quarters and individual rooms and there's no way that portions of this institution can be isolated in the event that there's a disturbance.","start":193.233,"stop":202.559,"duration":9.33},{"text":"The superintendent testified that he was concerned that at a movie that was coming up on the following weekend where all of the population would be in one room that there might be a disturbance that the friction might result in a fight between the two factions.","start":202.559,"stop":218.294,"duration":15.74},{"text":"And on the 6th of June, he called the Correction Department in Albany and he requested permission to transfer a small group of inmates without any disciplinary consequences merely to protect them and to cool the situation.","start":218.294,"stop":231.596,"duration":13.3},{"text":"And he was given that permission and on June 8, 1972, five out of eight inmates who have been recommended by his deputies for transfer were sent to other correctional facilities.","start":231.596,"stop":242.927,"duration":11.33},{"text":"The Superintendent himself did not choose where they were sent that was done by the Classification Board in Albany.","start":242.927,"stop":250.666,"duration":7.74},{"text":"About a month after these transfers took place, the respondent Newkirk and his co-plaintiffs at time began this lawsuit in the Southern District of New York.","start":250.666,"stop":260.481,"duration":9.81},{"text":"And they asked the district judge for a Temporary Restraining Order returning them to Wallkill pending the outcome of the case.","start":260.481,"stop":267.449,"duration":6.97},{"text":"The district judge denied that relief but set the case down for an early trial.","start":267.449,"stop":272.492,"duration":5.04},{"text":"The trial did take place in November of 1972 in the Southern District of New York and by that time two of the group that have been transferred had already been paroled and their cases were immediately dismissed as moot.","start":272.492,"stop":287.316,"duration":14.82},{"text":"The district judge heard testimony from the two remaining inmates and from the superintendent and from a Deputy Commissioner of Corrections and at the close of the trial, the district judge reserved decision and as an effort toward settling the case.","start":287.316,"stop":299.878,"duration":12.56},{"text":"The superintendent agreed to take the two remaining plaintiffs back to Wallkill without there having to go to any other facilities.","start":299.878,"stop":308.718,"duration":8.84},{"text":"They were taken back and settlement and negotiations began, we discussed the possibility of the consent decree and in the interim another of the plaintiffs was given an open parole day and he was paroled in February of 1973.","start":308.718,"stop":324.625,"duration":15.91},{"text":"At that point, there was only one plaintiff left that was Mr. Newkirk and he had been at Wallkill for three or four months at this time.","start":324.625,"stop":331.499,"duration":6.87},{"text":"He had been returned to his job.","start":331.499,"stop":333.482,"duration":1.98},{"text":"The superintendent believed that there were no longer any difficulties and he affirmed that he would treat this man fairly that there would be no retribution for having brought the lawsuit.","start":333.482,"stop":344.203,"duration":10.72},{"text":"And at that point, we decided to seize our settlement efforts and to move to dismiss the case as moot.","start":344.203,"stop":351.004,"duration":6.8},{"text":"We made our motion in March of 1973 and the district judge granted that motion as to the third inmate who had been paroled but the district judge reserved decision as to Mr. Newkirk because he was still in custody.","start":351.004,"stop":365.06,"duration":14.06},{"text":"And I might add that at time Mr. Newkirk was not yet eligible for parole.","start":365.06,"stop":369.368,"duration":4.31},{"text":"His earliest parole eligibility is in July of 1975.","start":369.368,"stop":375.265,"duration":5.9},{"text":"The District Court handed down its decision in October of 1973 and it held that although there was not a sufficiently delineated controversy to warrant the granting of an injunction it nevertheless issued the declaratory judgment and it held that the Mr. Newkirk's rights have been violated because he had not been informed in advance of the rules of the institution that would lead to a transfer.","start":375.265,"stop":401.378,"duration":26.11},{"text":"When the District Court entered its judgment it added an additional requirement that if Mr. Newkirk was to be transferred in the future that he would be entitled to notice of charges and an opportunity to be heard.","start":401.378,"stop":413.366,"duration":11.99}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

Hoffman","textObjs":[{"text":"That's correct.","start":507.939,"stop":513.953,"duration":6.01},{"text":"Your Honors, we believe that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed on two grounds.","start":513.953,"stop":519.605,"duration":5.65},{"text":"Number one as a matter of law and number two on the grounds of mootness and with respect to our first ground, we think that this Court should declare and make it clear that the lower federal courts that where an inmate is moved between institutions and he is not places in solitary confinement does not lose his good behavior allowances, does not suffer adverse parole consequences that in that situation, the man is not entitled to a due process hearing of the sort that he would receive under Wolff versus McDonnell.","start":519.605,"stop":555.209,"duration":35.6},{"text":"In a footnote in Wolff, this Court stated that the procedures in that case were intended to apply to solitary confinement of loss of good behavior allowances but not necessarily to other losses of privileges.","start":555.209,"stop":568.661,"duration":13.45},{"text":"Now, we think there is some very compelling reasons why the Due Process Clause should not apply in this situation.","start":568.661,"stop":575.213,"duration":6.55},{"text":"First, many transfers are made for security reasons and we are required to act on confidential information which it may very well be dangerous to reveal to the inmate.","start":575.213,"stop":588.156,"duration":12.94},{"text":"Both Superintendent Butler and the Deputy Commissioner of Correction testified that it's a matter of correctional procedure an inmate has never told in advance that he's going to be transferred because by telling him in advance it may provoke the act of misconduct which the transfer is designed to prevent.","start":588.156,"stop":606.235,"duration":18.08},{"text":"Very often we received information from confidential sources sometimes from other inmates and if we were to reveal why someone was being transferred it might very well reveal the source, it might provoke an act of violence.","start":606.235,"stop":619.538,"duration":13.3},{"text":"And as we've cited in our both in our petition for certiorari and in our brief there have been many cases in the last two or three years where prison administrators have been sued for damages and sometimes personal damages for failing to protect inmates from assaults by other inmates.","start":619.538,"stop":636.096,"duration":16.56},{"text":"And the power to move to inmates between institutions is one of the primary ways that these types of assaults can be prevented.","start":636.096,"stop":643.886,"duration":7.79},{"text":"These are situations where we don't want to bring the man up on disciplinary charges.","start":643.886,"stop":648.857,"duration":4.97},{"text":"We may not have enough concrete information to bring him up on disciplinary charges.","start":648.857,"stop":653.967,"duration":5.11},{"text":"We don't wish to adverse the effect his record.","start":653.967,"stop":656.842,"duration":2.88},{"text":"We merely want to remove him from that situation.","start":656.842,"stop":660.733,"duration":3.89},{"text":"The second reason why we think that due process is inappropriate here is that these procedures may well inhibit some of our rehabilitation programs.","start":660.733,"stop":670.475,"duration":9.74},{"text":"In New York State, we have movement now toward the use of medium and minimum security facilities and these programs are based on the assumption that if the program is not working or if the inmate is not working out in that program that we can move a man out there.","start":670.475,"stop":686.064,"duration":15.59},{"text":"And if we're in a situation where when we move a group of men to a new facility we have to give everyone of them a due process hearing when we decide for programmatic reasons to move them to another facility or to change them and move them into a new program.","start":686.064,"stop":699.882,"duration":13.82},{"text":"We feel that that would be a very undue burden on the administration and moreover, they're may not be much that the inmate himself can contribute at the hearing, it maybe for reasons that a totally unrelated to his conduct.","start":699.882,"stop":712.975,"duration":13.09},{"text":"Thirdly, we think that --","start":712.975,"stop":713.68,"duration":0.7}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"And maybe they might not want the hearing?","start":713.68,"stop":718.272,"duration":4.59}]},{"speakerName":"Hillel Hoffman","textObjs":[{"text":"That may be true Your Honor.","start":718.272,"stop":719.929,"duration":1.66}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"You'd only give the hearing if they asked for it.","start":719.929,"stop":721.702,"duration":1.77}]},{"speakerName":"Hillel Hoffman","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes but I think many inmates faced with the transfer to a facility that they might not wish to go to would probably request the hearing if they could get one.","start":721.702,"stop":732.932,"duration":11.23},{"text":"We also think that this Court should reject the concept which is inherent in the Court of Appeals' decision and the District Court decision that because an inmate is sent to an institution which has programs that he feels will benefit him or which is geographically convenient for him that if he is removed from that institution he must be given a hearing.","start":732.932,"stop":754.464,"duration":21.53},{"text":"And the Solicitor General has argued quite extensively in their brief and we agree with them that merely because a man has been sent to a particular facility does not mean that he should have a legal right protected by the Due Process Clause to remain there.","start":754.464,"stop":768.576,"duration":14.11},{"text":"We ran a unitary correction system.","start":768.576,"stop":770.763,"duration":2.19},{"text":"We have 24 institutions in the State of New York and our entire program is based on the assumption that we can move man freely between our facilities without having to give them hearings every time we change the custody level.","start":770.763,"stop":785.241,"duration":14.48},{"text":"We also think that this is one area where the need for some re-adjudication outweighs the individual inmate's interest in due process.","start":785.241,"stop":796.613,"duration":11.37},{"text":"First, as I mentioned before we don't believe that notice of charges and advance warning is appropriate in many of these cases as I said it would provoke the very act that we're trying to prevent.","start":796.613,"stop":808.383,"duration":11.77},{"text":"Secondly, where the transfer is being made for diagnostic reasons it may not be helpful to the inmate to tell him that he is being transferred because he has a personality disorder or because he is intellectually incapable of functioning in a particular program.","start":808.383,"stop":823.199,"duration":14.82},{"text":"And we don't think they're giving him a hearing in this type of situation will benefit him or that he will be able to add anything that will aid the decision makers in making their decision.","start":823.199,"stop":835.073,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Thirdly, we think that due process procedures are certainly not helpful where inmates are being moved because of budgetary reason or because a particular facility is being faced out or converted into a different type of facility.","start":835.073,"stop":848.293,"duration":13.22},{"text":"And if I may give an example here in the fall of 1973 we converted the Sing Sing Correctional Facility from essentially a long-term institution to a short-term institution.","start":848.293,"stop":860.048,"duration":11.75},{"text":"And in the process we have to move 750 inmates to maximum security facilities because that was the only place we can send them.","start":860.048,"stop":867.897,"duration":7.85},{"text":"Now, under the rational of the decisions below, I suppose that we would be required to give all of them due process hearings because we changed their custody levels and because they may not enjoy some of the privileges of the new institutions that they enjoyed at Sing Sing and because many of them may be further from their homes.","start":867.897,"stop":885.935,"duration":18.04},{"text":"But I think if we had to give 750 hearings in that situation it would've been truly intolerable burden.","start":885.935,"stop":893.178,"duration":7.24}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
