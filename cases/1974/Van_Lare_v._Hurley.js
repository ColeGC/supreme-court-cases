appropriate to review briefly the two factual situations in which the nonpaying lodger provision operates, which show in effect that both these contentions are incorrect.","start":630.382,"stop":664.25,"duration":33.87},{"text":"First, when an individual is added to a dwelling after recipient shelter needs were originally budgeted, under these circumstances, the preexisting per capita costs of the recipient shares must be reevaluated to reflect the fact that the shelter needs of an additional individual are being met, and that the actual or allowed rent is now allocable among the increased number of individuals.","start":664.25,"stop":695.056,"duration":30.81},{"text":"Two results follow: a reduction in per capita shelter need and cost of the recipients, and a consequent reduction in shelter allowances.","start":695.056,"stop":704.45,"duration":9.39},{"text":"Now, this result occurs regardless or whether the individual who is added to the

unit.","start":717.568,"stop":732.619,"duration":15.05},{"text":"The result under the New York program is to reduce the per capita shelter cost of the AFDC recipient, and to pay the proportionate share now held by the home relief recipient from the home relief program.","start":732.619,"stop":750.436,"duration":17.82},{"text":"Now, under the specific terms of the regulation in issue, when the individual that is added to the dwelling is a non-recipient and nonpaying, we recognize these facts in the regulation by not providing a subsidy for the non-recipient, and by recognizing as well that since that recipient is nonpaying, per force, a share of that shelter cost will remain unpaid.","start":750.436,"stop":783.144,"duration":32.71},{"text":"The fact that the shelter cost, a share will remain unpaid does not mean that the preexisting shares were not in fact reduced when the lodger moved into the dwelling, since the lodger is in fact meeting his own needs by his additional beneficial use of the premises, nor does it mean that the lodger's, the recipient's shares can be increased if the lodger doesn't pay by transference of these -- the lodger's shelter needs to the recipient group.","start":783.144,"stop":814.802,"duration":31.66},{"text":"The second situation in which the nonpaying lodger provision operates, but does not reduce allowances is shown by the facts since support of the appellee Taylor's claim.","start":814.802,"stop":825.419,"duration":10.62},{"text":"When AFDC recipient share dwelling with home relief recipients and one or the other recipient group looses its eligibility, and thus maybe become a nonpaying lodger under the terms of the regulation, the per capita cost of that individual is again not compensated.","start":825.419,"stop":846.304,"duration":20.88},{"text":"However, since the number of individuals in the dwelling remained the same, the valuation of the preexisting shares also remains the same, and there is no reduction in the recipient's -- in the shelter allowances payable to the remaining recipients.","start":846.304,"stop":864.704,"duration":18.4},{"text":"Thus, when appellee Taylor and her minor child received AFDC and appellee's sister received home relief, the maximum allowed rent for the apartment was prorated two-thirds to AFDC and one-third to HR for appellee's sister.","start":864.704,"stop":882.494,"duration":17.79},{"text":"When appellee's sister lost her home relief eligibility and became a nonpaying lodger, appellee and her minor child continued to
