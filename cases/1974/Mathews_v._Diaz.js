of a three-judge district court in Florida.","start":34.087,"stop":41.983,"duration":7.9},{"text":"Like the previous case, it involves the challenge to the Federal Government's power to classify on the basis of alienage.","start":41.983,"stop":49.65,"duration":7.67},{"text":"The appellees are three aliens who wish to enroll in a subsidized federal medical insurance program for the elderly.","start":49.65,"stop":59.463,"duration":9.81},{"text":"This program is part of the overall Social Security Insurance System for people over 65.","start":59.463,"stop":67.012,"duration":7.55},{"text":"That system consists of three parts.","start":67.012,"stop":70.07,"duration":3.06},{"text":"First, there is the basic retirement insurance which is old age and survivors insurance.","start":70.07,"stop":77.263,"duration":7.19},{"text":"Eligibility for that insurance is based on age and work in covered employment.","start":77.263,"stop":84.118,"duration":6.85},{"text":"Citizenship or alienage has almost nothing to do with it and almost all employment in this country is covered.","start":84.118,"stop":93.629,"duration":9.51},{"text":"Second, there's hospital -- hospitalization insurance which is referred to us Medicare Part A and eligibility is based primarily on entitlement to the basic retirement insurance.","start":93.629,"stop":109.571,"duration":15.94},{"text":"The third category is the one involved in this litigation and that is Medicare Part B, supplemental medical insurance.","start":109.571,"stop":119.595,"duration":10.02},{"text":"Part B is a voluntary program.","start":119.595,"stop":122.947,"duration":3.35},{"text":"Those who enroll who currently pay $6.70 a month which the Government matches.","start":122.947,"stop":130.327,"duration":7.38},{"text":"The fund created by these contributions pays 80% of covered medical expenses and they're mainly doctor's fees and medication.","start":130.327,"stop":143.497,"duration":13.17},{"text":"Appellees are all over 65.","start":143.497,"stop":146.733,"duration":3.24},{"text":"They want to enroll in Medicare sub Part B but they were refused because Part B insurance is available only to persons who are eligible for Part A insurance to citizens or to aliens admitted for permanent residence who have actually been residents for five years.","start":146.733,"stop":168.29,"duration":21.56},{"text":"All three named appellees entered this country in 1971.","start":168.29,"stop":172.949,"duration":4.66},{"text":"So they don't need the five-year residence requirement.","start":172.949,"stop":176.818,"duration":3.87},{"text":"In addition, two of the appellees were admitted under the special Cuban refugee program and not for permanent residents.","start":176.818,"stop":186.48,"duration":9.66},{"text":"So on that ground also, they're ineligible for Medicare Part B.","start":186.48,"stop":191.647,"duration":5.17},{"text":"The Cuban program does not -- does permit a retroactive adjustment of status.","start":191.647,"stop":196.82,"duration":5.17},{"text":"So that by the time these two appellees have been here for five years, they probably will be eligible for Medicare Part B since their status will have been adjusted to that of permanent resident aliens.","start":196.82,"stop":210.532,"duration":13.71},{"text":"This is a class action and the court below defined the class as all immigrants denied enrollment in sub Part B because they're not lawfully admitted for permanent residents and have not met the five-year residency requirement.","start":210.532,"stop":225.768,"duration":15.24},{"text":"It also established a Sub Class represented by single appellee, Espinosa of those denied benefits solely because they could not meet the durational residence requirement.","start":225.768,"stop":240.6,"duration":14.83},{"text":"The Court held that the durational residence requirement denied appellees equal protection because it did -- it was not rationally related to any valid congressional purpose.","start":240.6,"stop":252.551,"duration":11.95},{"text":"It also held that the durational residence requirement was not separable from the requirement that the alien be lawfully admitted for permanent residence.","start":252.551,"stop":263.721,"duration":11.17},{"text":"And therefore, it struck all the aliage provisions from the Medicare Sub Part B eligibility provisions.","start":263.721,"stop":273.273,"duration":9.55},{"text":"We've discussed the separability issue in our brief and I don't propose to discuss that further this afternoon.","start":273.273,"stop":284.877,"duration":11.6},{"text":"It is our contention here as it was in the preceding case that equal protection analysis is simply inappropriate when considering federal statutes dealing with alienage in view of the basis and extent of Congress' broad powers over immigration.","start":284.877,"stop":306.678,"duration":21.8},{"text":"Solicitor general presented that view this morning and I don't propose to go into that again.","start":306.678,"stop":315.157,"duration":8.48},{"text":"I do want to point out that the Medicare eligibility provision at issue here is closely related to immigration policy.","start":315.157,"stop":324.651,"duration":9.49},{"text":"As a matter of fact, the court below rather surprisingly indicated that it had doubts about the constitutionality of the admitted for permanent residence requirement for part of the statute precisely because it was so closely related to the policy expressed in the Immigration Act.","start":324.651,"stop":349.809,"duration":25.16},{"text":"The Immigration Act provides that one of the qualifications for admission as an immigrant is that the applicant not be likely to become a public charge.","start":349.809,"stop":361.669,"duration":11.86},{"text":"Now the practical effect of that requirement particularly for people over 60, are the only ones that are affected by this Medicare provision is that they must either be economically independent or have someone in this country who is willing to assume responsibility for their support.","start":361.669,"stop":383.677,"duration":22.01},{"text":"The Medicare limitation simply defines the extent of the support obligation.","start":383.677,"stop":391.458,"duration":7.78},{"text":"The effect of the immigration statute and the Medicare statute taken together is the same as if Congress had explicitly provided in the Immigration Act that elderly immigrants must undertake to provide for their own medical needs for five years after they enter either by private insurance or by having the financial capability of doing it independently of insurance.","start":391.458,"stop":424.468,"duration":33.01},{"text":"Congress could certainly have done -- made that provision directly in the Immigration Act.","start":424.468,"stop":431.329,"duration":6.86},{"text":"We submit that Congress has an equal right to do it indirectly through the Medicare Act.","start":431.329,"stop":441.232,"duration":9.9},{"text":"It's the essence of congressional power over immigration to decide which groups it will encourage to immigrate, and which discourage and also to decide how much encouragement it will offer.","start":441.232,"stop":459.093,"duration":17.86},{"text":"An elderly person considering immigration will normally consider the cost of living in this country.","start":459.093,"stop":467.03,"duration":7.94},{"text":"Part of that cost is the cost medical care.","start":467.03,"stop":472.268,"duration":5.24},{"text":"If subsidized government insurance is available, the cost will be lower than if it is not and if it's available after five years, the cost is less than if it's not available at all.","start":472.268,"stop":488.505,"duration":16.24},{"text":"Immigration is thus encouraged by making the insurance available, but it's not encouraged as much as it would be if the insurance was available immediately on entry.","start":488.505,"stop":503.006,"duration":14.5},{"text":"Congressional judgments concerning immigration policy are entitled to great judicial deference.","start":503.006,"stop":509.205,"duration":6.2},{"text":"This Medicare eligibility provision is an expression of congressional immigration policy and as such it's entitled to great judicial deference.","start":509.205,"stop":526.636,"duration":17.43},{"text":"For that reason, even if this judgment is subject to review on equal protection grounds, the Court need do no more than assure itself that there's a rational justification for the restrictions on alien eligibility and there is such a justification in this case.","start":526.636,"stop":549.197,"duration":22.56},{"text":"The Part B Medicare program is part of the overall Social Security Insurance Program.","start":549.197,"stop":558.29,"duration":9.09},{"text":"That program is not basically a welfare program in which payments are based on current needs.","start":558.29,"stop":567.038,"duration":8.75},{"text":"There's no means test for eligibility.","start":567.038,"stop":571.403,"duration":4.37},{"text":"Instead, the insurance is available to those to whom Congress has determined that the country owes an obligation.","start":571.403,"stop":582.422,"duration":11.02},{"text":"This Court has in fact recognized that that sense of obligation is the basis of the original Social Security Program which is of course the root stock of the whole Federal Social Insurance Program particularly for the elderly.","start":582.422,"stop":600.376,"duration":17.95},{"text":"If I may quote from Flemming v. Nestor, the program is based on a legislative judgment that those who in their productive years were functioning members of the economy may just call on that economy in their later years for protection from the rigors of the poor house.","start":600.376,"stop":627.554,"duration":27.18},{"text":"In setting up the Part B eligibility provisions, Congress went somewhat further.","start":627.554,"stop":634.89,"duration":7.34},{"text":"It extended the benefits to all citizens and to aliens with a substantial relation to this country but the theory remained the same.","start":634.89,"stop":647.201,"duration":12.31},{"text":"Congress simply recognized that resident aliens like citizens pay taxes are subject to military service and contribute in myriad other ways to our national community.","start":647.201,"stop":663.774,"duration":16.57},{"text":"Citizens, who in the overwhelming majority of cases make these contributions throughout their lives, may not enroll in Sub Part B until they're 65.","start":663.774,"stop":676.088,"duration":12.31},{"text":"An alien, who makes his myriad contributions in his country of origin during his working life may retire and come here and after only five years of contributing to this community, he's eligible to enroll in Medicare Sub Part B on the same basis as a citizen.","start":676.088,"stop":699.073,"duration":22.99},{"text":"That's not certainly an unreasonable discrimination against the alien.","start":699.073,"stop":705.843,"duration":6.77},{"text":"In fact, the only person is more favorably treated would be a US citizen who had never lived in this country and then returned in his old age and was immediately eligible for the Medicare Sub Part B and that I submit is such a small group that its really diminimous.","start":705.843,"stop":731.087,"duration":25.24}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, wouldn't it also -- wouldn't an American citizen who hadn't been under the Social Security Act to the railroad retirement program and who reached 65 be more favorably treated?","start":731.087,"stop":742.781,"duration":11.69}]},{"speakerName":"Harriet S.
