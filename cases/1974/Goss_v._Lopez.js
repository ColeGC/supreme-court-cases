several fires in one of the school building.","start":43.249,"stop":74.856,"duration":31.61},{"text":"One of the schools had to be closed for a period of time trying to bring order back, open defiance

listen to them and they were going to tell him how it was going to be run.","start":74.856,"stop":102.51,"duration":27.65},{"text":"From that pattern of internal disruption, there occurred a series of temporary suspensions from anywhere from five to ten days arising under a statute Section 3313.66 of the Ohio Revised Code, which allowed a principal to temporarily suspend for a period of one to ten days without holding a formal hearing.","start":102.51,"stop":133.254,"duration":30.74},{"text":"The statute required the principal or administrative official to send a notification to the parents and to the School Department of the fact that the suspension.","start":133.254,"stop":148.016,"duration":14.76},{"text":"The statute also contained a provision which in the case of expulsion, required that the parents where expulsion was going to take place, could appeal that action to the Board of Education and the question of whether or not the child should be expelled would be heard by the Columbus Board of Education.","start":148.016,"stop":171.324,"duration":23.31},{"text":"Following this pattern of temporary suspensions, a 1983 Civil Rights Action was instituted in which the section
