Rhyne","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":57.036,"stop":59.761,"duration":2.73},{"text":"The appellants here states and cities challenge the constitutionality of some 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which covered the -- all the remaining employees of states and cities under that act.","start":59.761,"stop":77.4,"duration":17.64},{"text":"The way it was done was by declaring all states and all cities to be commercial enterprises and under that enterprise interpretation to apply all of the regulations of the act to the states and cities.","start":77.4,"stop":95.839,"duration":18.44},{"text":"But first of all, I'd like to point out that this is not a minimum wage case.","start":95.839,"stop":101.332,"duration":5.49},{"text":"It isn't a case involving the low paid people.","start":101.332,"stop":105.953,"duration":4.62},{"text":"It's the application of this act to their relatively high paid people, the wiping out of state and local Government civil service laws, processes, procedures, the forced restructuring of the way that they will render far service for example, it is the -- which results in enormous increases in cost.","start":105.953,"stop":127.933,"duration":21.98},{"text":"These are the things that the states and the cities complain of and say to this Court that this act is really a very massive complex regulatory act which in affect reaches every employee, be he working in the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of state Government.","start":127.933,"stop":150.276,"duration":22.34},{"text":"Now, there are some exemptions for elected officials and their confidential age and for professional people.","start":150.276,"stop":156.576,"duration":6.3},{"text":"But, the interesting thing about the application of this act in the claim repeatedly that is to correct substandard labor conditions is that in the entire record made over three or four years in the Congress, the appellee's predecessors in the Department of Labor were only able to find they claim.","start":156.576,"stop":176.367,"duration":19.79},{"text":"95,000 people out of 11,400,000 who in 1973 they thought could be covered by this act, who where getting less than the minimum wage and we doubt frankly that figure because it shows here in the record that firefighters get $12,000.00 a year, the highly publicized New York garbage collectors and sweepers get $20,000.00 up to $24,500.00, and out in San Francisco, they get almost as much.","start":176.367,"stop":210.304,"duration":33.94},{"text":"So we're not talking about minimum wages, we're not talking about substandard conditions.","start":210.304,"stop":217.271,"duration":6.97},{"text":"What we are talking about is a basic restructuring of Government in the United States of America, big change in our federal system of Government whereby for the first time, in all history, the federal Government is asserting power over every state, over every city and every employee they have.","start":217.271,"stop":236.573,"duration":19.3},{"text":"There can be no question about that because as appellee admits, you have to keep a record for even the exempt people.","start":236.573,"stop":242.18,"duration":5.61},{"text":"So this is a massive takeover, it's in the massive overlapping duplication, nullification of civil service, debt limit, tax limit, budget limit laws and it affects this vast change in power and we talked mostly about power.","start":242.18,"stop":264.259,"duration":22.08},{"text":"Appellee talks about payroll cost and say they are nothing but we talk about power of Government and we say here that the federal Government is asserting jurisdiction for the first time over their most important element in every state and local budget for personnel cost.","start":264.259,"stop":281.855,"duration":17.6},{"text":"Cities have 80% to 85% of their budget in personnel cost.","start":281.855,"stop":288.529,"duration":6.67},{"text":"States, California has 76% and other states are similar.","start":288.529,"stop":294.788,"duration":6.26},{"text":"So, we say that this act is a massive takeover of functions that had been performed on the local level since the founding of our nation.","start":294.788,"stop":307.459,"duration":12.67},{"text":"I used one illustration of the wiping out of ballot box control.","start":307.459,"stop":311.886,"duration":4.43},{"text":"In the record pages 4, 14 and following, there's a copy of the New Jersey statute.","start":311.886,"stop":317.47,"duration":5.58},{"text":"That statute applies to the platoon system for fireman.","start":317.47,"stop":321.092,"duration":3.62},{"text":"It says you have the fireman on 24 hours, off 24 hours, and they can work 56 hours a week, but only after that has been approved by referendum of the local voters and no one can look.","start":321.092,"stop":334.433,"duration":13.34},{"text":"If the regulations were promulgated on the 20th of December 1974 by the wage in our administrator for the Secretary of Labor and not see that this New Jersey statute is wiped out completely.","start":334.433,"stop":350.4,"duration":15.97},{"text":"And all across this nation from the New England town meetings to the referenda that they are so popular at West where they have a referenda almost on everything, every time we have had a fundamental increase in money or fundamental change in providing unique services uniquely needed by a particular city or state because of geography and other reasons, there's always the possibility new other people voting on it as they did in New Jersey.","start":350.4,"stop":379.867,"duration":29.47},{"text":"But under this act and under the actions of the appellee that ballot box control is gone forever.","start":379.867,"stop":386.905,"duration":7.04},{"text":"Now, this act as I say is a massive imposition down at top of massive legislation that's already in effect, affecting states and cities.","start":386.905,"stop":396.832,"duration":9.93},{"text":"This is where they spend most of their money.","start":396.832,"stop":401.202,"duration":4.37},{"text":"Mr. Solicitor General, I didn't mean to hit you.","start":401.202,"stop":407.612,"duration":6.41},{"text":"They spend as I say, 85% of their money on personnel and they have a very -- carefully down through the years developed civil service and tenure laws for their people.","start":407.612,"stop":421.254,"duration":13.64},{"text":"And now, instead of -- and I think this illustrates it best.","start":421.254,"stop":424.346,"duration":3.09},{"text":"Instead of looking to the city council, looking to the local processes, procedures, the Civil Service Commission of the City of New York are the Civil Service Commission in the State in New York.","start":424.346,"stop":434.975,"duration":10.63},{"text":"What they do here is they look to the appellee, the Secretary of Labor and they looked to the Congress because once this power is established, every kind of employee in this whole nation has to go to the Congress or can go to Congress to get their employment status changed.","start":434.975,"stop":452.6,"duration":17.63},{"text":"So they no longer look to City Hall, they no longer look to the state capitol.","start":452.6,"stop":457.028,"duration":4.43},{"text":"This is a vast change in the outlook and the power and it's the centralization here in the federal Government of power over the most important group, because the cities are bundles of legal powers.","start":457.028,"stop":473.13,"duration":16.1},{"text":"They can only act through people and this act touches every one of them.","start":473.13,"stop":477.399,"duration":4.27},{"text":"It's an assertion of sovereign power over every employee of a state and city throughout the nation.","start":477.399,"stop":484.097,"duration":6.7},{"text":"One of the experts that I would like to call the Court's attention to, to nail down how complex, to nail down how massive, to nail down the fact that this is a double standard of hours and wages is the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission.","start":484.097,"stop":508.509,"duration":24.41},{"text":"The Chairman of the Civil Service Commission appeared and I quote from about three sentences from page 9 of our brief.","start":508.509,"stop":515.134,"duration":6.63},{"text":"He appeared on the 26th of February 1975 before the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service in the House of Representative and this is what he said,“The extension of the Fair Labor Standards Act to federal employment is a case in point.","start":515.134,"stop":530.831,"duration":15.7},{"text":"It adds a new set of complex provisions to the already existing provisions of Title V.","start":530.831,"stop":542.751,"duration":11.92},{"text":"It creates two standards, governing pay and hours of work.","start":542.751,"stop":548.352,"duration":5.6},{"text":"It results in double record keeping and double work.","start":548.352,"stop":552.591,"duration":4.24},{"text":"It is an extremely high administrative cost

the page, I'm reading three sentences from the testimony of the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission who spoke of how complex this act when it's imposed down upon the civil service system of the United States of America and how it imposes double standards, double bookkeeping, double work for negligible benefits.","start":569.996,"stop":596.355,"duration":26.36},{"text":"Now, it's even worst for states and cities because while the Congress gave this regulatory power to the Civil Service Commission so that disruption could be avoided.","start":596.355,"stop":607.359,"duration":11},{"text":"Just think of what it's doing to the states and cities, we were all placed in with commercial enterprises before the Secretary of Labor.","start":607.359,"stop":616.221,"duration":8.86},{"text":"We have in the act and in its application in this power shift, so many instances similar to the one I cited in the New Jersey where the existing law of states is wiped out, where the existing processes, procedures and such with respect to employee rights is wiped out.","start":616.221,"stop":645.523,"duration":29.3},{"text":"Now, another thing this act does, it brings a whole new set of definitions of overtime of who is an expert.","start":645.523,"stop":655.456,"duration":9.93},{"text":"There are 51 pages in the Code of Federal Regulation about who about what overtime is.","start":655.456,"stop":660.894,"duration":5.44},{"text":"There are 42 pages defining who is an exempt person.","start":660.894,"stop":665.44,"duration":4.55},{"text":"Now, the Civil Service Commission that we quoted in our brief said they're going to define themselves who is an exempt person.","start":665.44,"stop":671.756,"duration":6.32},{"text":"But my major point is that there is such a vast shift in power to say what overtime shall be, just say who shall be exempt.","start":671.756,"stop":683.384,"duration":11.63},{"text":"All these kind of things when you impose those down on the area where states and the cities spend the majority of their money, where they have developed all these rules and regulations as in New Jersey for years and years, and their people have voted them in or voted them out and that's all gone now.","start":683.384,"stop":698.983,"duration":15.6},{"text":"You're going to have it imposed from on high by the Secretary of Labor or by the Congress.","start":698.983,"stop":704.942,"duration":5.96},{"text":"The big impact in one area I think is most dramatic and that is in the area of voluntarism.","start":704.942,"stop":717.753,"duration":12.81},{"text":"In the United States of America, in Government areas, we depend more on volunteers than any other system of Government in the world.","start":717.753,"stop":723.873,"duration":6.12},{"text":"And if the local level, we have volunteer fireman, we have volunteer police, we have volunteer of this and volunteer of that, there are millions of them.","start":723.873,"stop":731.933,"duration":8.06},{"text":"Now, this act when it was written, it defined employ as to suffer our permit to work.","start":731.933,"stop":739.653,"duration":7.72},{"text":"Now, that's all right insofar as private industries are concerned because they don't have this volunteer problem.","start":739.653,"stop":747.298,"duration":7.64},{"text":"But look at the states and cities who sometimes pay a volunteer fireman $2.50 to go on each fire, look at the situation that exist where they sometimes give the volunteer policeman uniforms and they sometimes pay insurance on them.","start":747.298,"stop":770.109,"duration":22.81},{"text":"Now, the only answer to that appellee is well, you just have to take it case by case as to where.","start":770.109,"stop":776.662,"duration":6.55},{"text":"A volunteer crosses over the line from being a volunteer to being an employer or employee.","start":776.662,"stop":783.708,"duration":7.05},{"text":"And so, that creates this consternation all across our nation and in other area, it's going to be very, very damaging.","start":783.708,"stop":795,"duration":11.29},{"text":"At the local level, we use thousands of interns.","start":795,"stop":798.928,"duration":3.93},{"text":"Now frankly, the interns are not worth that much to local Government, it's more of a favor to the intern to bring then in then it -- to a really a benefit for a state or city.","start":798.928,"stop":809.178,"duration":10.25},{"text":"But now, they are going to have to be paid if certain things occur because of the interns have to leave and you pay him a little bit, you're going to have to pay him a lot.","start":809.178,"stop":817.746,"duration":8.57},{"text":"But there's another area where this whole thing really hurts.","start":817.746,"stop":821.868,"duration":4.12},{"text":"Many of the volunteer firemen, as the record showed, many of the volunteer policemen are already, let's say a city engineer or schoolteacher.","start":821.868,"stop":829.938,"duration":8.07},{"text":"Now, if they go out as a volunteer on a fire or for some as a policeman and they worked in addition to their 40 hours as an engineer or schoolteacher, a few more hours and they are rule to be an employee during their volunteer time because they receive some minor compensation.","start":829.938,"stop":849.744,"duration":19.81},{"text":"Well, the act says that you've got to pay them time and a -- over -- time and a half for overtime at their same rate of pay.","start":849.744,"stop":856.725,"duration":6.98},{"text":"Their may be a highly paid engineer getting $25,000.00 a year and when you look at paying him overtime for his volunteer firework or as volunteer police, you just mess up the structure of voluntarism throughout our nation.","start":856.725,"stop":868.331,"duration":11.61},{"text":"I don't think there's ever been anything that has so cost, confusion, and this massive confusion was referred to by Mr. Alan Prichard, the Executive Vice President of the League of Cities in the record here saying that, “No one could really tell where you are and where you're going because you have all of these complex regulations imposed suddenly down on already complex, already regulatory regulations of the status and tenure of city employees.”","start":868.331,"stop":898.407,"duration":30.08},{"text":"But, perhaps, one of the most devastating fears of states and cities is that this act creates class actions.","start":898.407,"stop":908.573,"duration":10.17},{"text":"Now, you don't have class action against cities under their current set up but they do have fair hearings, they do have court cases, and as we point out giving any time, the one-third of all litigation before state courts is really involving personnel matters.","start":908.573,"stop":923.987,"duration":15.41},{"text":"So here, you have this act saying that you can either -- the appellee or an employee can bring a class action.","start":923.987,"stop":933.731,"duration":9.74},{"text":"His attorney gets attorney's fees, it gets cost, and you get double time, triple time if you win.","start":933.731,"stop":939.868,"duration":6.14},{"text":"Now, from a state in determining whether a man has crossed that line as a volunteer, from a state is to whether the intern gets too much, the damage is enormous because they can make a mistake of fact or law.","start":939.868,"stop":955.502,"duration":15.63},{"text":"In a city like New York, it cannot run up to enormous, enormous cost.","start":955.502,"stop":960.587,"duration":5.09}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
