Furman point, the Government has abandoned some arguments that are earlier advanced including I might note the argument that the majority of the Court of Appeals below adopted its rationale of decision, namely that death sentence was never imposed in petitioner's case because it had never been ordered executed.","start":598.379,"stop":619.949,"duration":21.57},{"text":"Now, the Government's primary defense to the Furman point appears to rest on the contention raised for the first time and its brief under merits that Furman against Georgia does not apply to the military at all.","start":619.949,"stop":632.42,"duration":12.47},{"text":"This contention on the factual assertions that rest upon are wholly

here.","start":639.927,"stop":649.039,"duration":9.11},{"text":"Let me say only in summary that that proposition is directly contradicted by opinions of members of this Court in Furman against Georgia itself which expressly contemplate applicability to the military.","start":649.039,"stop":663.13,"duration":14.09},{"text":"It is also inconsistent with precedents of military courts and civilian courts including this Court applying the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishments to the military.","start":663.13,"stop":675.195,"duration":12.07},{"text":"But it must be emphasized that the proposition that the Government puts forward here is fundamentally inconsistent with the entire pattern of development of military law since the enactment of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950 because that pattern of growth which has been shaped by civilian court opinions, military court opinions, and by congressional enactments has consistently minimized the differences between military and civilian criminal procedures.","start":675.195,"stop":706.323,"duration":31.13},{"text":"Now, the Government offers two factual justifications, why Furman should not apply to the military.","start":706.323,"stop":713.055,"duration":6.73},{"text":"It should first be observed that whether or not these are true, these assertions would not serve to override contrary Bank of Preston cited in our brief.","start":713.055,"stop":723.061,"duration":10.01},{"text":"Moreover, by seeking a factual evaluation, the Government asks this Court to open the door to jurisdiction by jurisdiction review of the applicability of the Furman rationale to the particular experience of a given jurisdiction.","start":723.061,"stop":739.168,"duration":16.11},{"text":"But most important, the factual assertions that the Government seeks to rest its argument on are demonstrably false.","start":739.168,"stop":747.278,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The Government argues first that military discipline and special military circumstances require the use of the death penalty.","start":747.278,"stop":756.871,"duration":9.59},{"text":"Restated this argument is that military discipline is dependent upon capital punishment or more precisely dependent up on constitutionally cruel and unusual punishments.","start":756.871,"stop":768.775,"duration":11.9},{"text":"This is simply the baseless.","start":768.775,"stop":770.592,"duration":1.82},{"text":"The short answer is provided by the military itself or the death penalty and the military has fallen into destitude.","start":770.592,"stop":779.207,"duration":8.62},{"text":"It is simply not used.","start":779.207,"stop":780.963,"duration":1.76},{"text":"When it has been used by the military, it has been used not to further disciplinary purposes but the punish servicemen for committing civilian type offenses.","start":780.963,"stop":790.641,"duration":9.68},{"text":"The fact that the United States Marine Corps has gone for more than a century and a quarter without so much as it judging the death penalty at trial is itself conclusive evidence that the Government's claim is simply unsupportable.","start":790.641,"stop":808.258,"duration":17.62},{"text":"The Government also argues that the military appellate structure assures that the use of the death penalty in the military will not be random or discriminatory.","start":808.258,"stop":819.908,"duration":11.65},{"text":"This is first of all precisely the type of argument that this Court refused to hear in the petitions for rehearing submitted by the States of Pennsylvania and Georgia.","start":819.908,"stop":830.881,"duration":10.97},{"text":"Secondly, this is demonstrably untrue.","start":830.881,"stop":835.356,"duration":4.48},{"text":"We address this point at some length in our brief and I shall not repeat that.","start":835.356,"stop":840.243,"duration":4.89},{"text":"Let me say only, that we know that the use of the death penalty in the military is random in the extremes.","start":840.243,"stop":847.283,"duration":7.04},{"text":"We know that it is used so and frequently that it cannot possibly serve any legislative or social purpose.","start":847.283,"stop":853.441,"duration":6.16},{"text":"We know that it is discriminatory among the services for it's confined almost exclusively to the Army.","start":853.441,"stop":859.556,"duration":6.12},{"text":"We know that this impact is racially discriminatory of the eight servicemen executed since 1950, whose race we know, all were black.","start":859.556,"stop":869.648,"duration":10.09},{"text":"And furthermore, we know rather dramatically that in the military, the use of the death penalty does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the crime.","start":869.648,"stop":879.577,"duration":9.93},{"text":"By no stretch of the imagination can it be asserted with the use of the death penalty in the military is less discriminatory or less random or less irrational.","start":879.577,"stop":889.759,"duration":10.18},{"text":"There is in short no basis whatever for the factual assertions.","start":889.759,"stop":893.558,"duration":3.8},{"text":"The Government puts forward and on the basis of which the Government will have this Court override a substantial bank of contrary precedence.","start":893.558,"stop":904.178,"duration":10.62},{"text":"Our second point, in the broader constitutional point is that imposing the sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.","start":904.178,"stop":914.737,"duration":10.56},{"text":"The President exceeded his constitutional ground of authority under Article II, Section
