anonymously.","start":316.461,"stop":333.845,"duration":17.38},{"text":"Second, the portion of the statute in question does not substantially infringe upon the commercial printers and publisher's rights to association of privacy and to the extent that there maybe infringement which we denied that there is or were shown in the record in the court below, the state's interest in disclosure is sufficient to justify any infringement.","start":333.845,"stop":354.249,"duration":20.4},{"text":"Third, assuming arguendo that the printers possess such rights and they are in fact infringed

protecting electoral process.","start":360.797,"stop":371.964,"duration":11.17},{"text":"And fourth, the term person paying for the advertising is not unconstitutionally void because when you consider the statute in its entirety, any reasonable person exercising common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with the requirements.","start":371.964,"stop":389.24,"duration":17.28},{"text":"Now, before expanding on these four basic points, I believe will benefit the Court if I very briefly comment more on the background of the statute being challenged.","start":389.24,"stop":400.168,"duration":10.93},{"text":"From 1967 until 1973, a period of six years, Texas law required a political advertising as defined in Article 1410 (b), reflect

point for the benefit of Court that in the appendix which is supplied to the Court at page 65 is a full copy of the article as appears at the present time.","start":420.029,"stop":431.732,"duration":11.7},{"text":"Significantly, not during the period of six years, not once during that time was challenge made to the term person paying for the advertising as being unconstitutionally vague.","start":431.732,"stop":443.613,"duration":11.88},{"text":"In 1973, as a result of the experiences of the officers and the people of the State of Texas in which unethical and illegal conduct and political campaigns could not be effectively traced and thus not immediately prevented or prosecuted, the Texas Campaign Reporting and Disclosure Act was passed, designed to inform the public about the financing behind communications intended to influence their votes.","start":443.613,"stop":469.635,"duration":26.02},{"text":"Among other reforms, the

enacted on June 4, 1973 and a suit was filed on September 11, 1973.","start":496.441,"stop":511.239,"duration":14.8},{"text":"There's no evidence presented to the court below that the candidates or

responsibility of enforcing the uniform application of the Texas election laws.","start":552.447,"stop":570.828,"duration":18.38},{"text":"Parenthetically, a reading to the testimony of appellees' only to the live witnesses at the hearing of which a temporary restraining order was denied by Judge Singleton reveals that the testimony falls far short of establishing any likelihood of a chilling effect upon First Amendment rights.","start":570.828,"stop":589.684,"duration":18.86},{"text":"To use Mr. Justice Marshall's phrase from this morning, the plaintiff's counsel supports their allegations out of the clear blue sky.","start":589.684,"stop":600.828,"duration":11.14},{"text":"They are not supported by the evidences in the record in the case we have before us.","start":600.828,"stop":605.689,"duration":4.86},{"text":"In sum, the plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of proving to the court below or to this Court to declare the disclosure provision unconstitutional.","start":605.689,"stop":616.974,"duration":11.29},{"text":"Our first point is that the Commercial Printer's actions do not constitute speech as protected by the First Amendment.","start":616.974,"stop":623.726,"duration":6.75},{"text":"And even as such speech is protected, the First Amendment, freedoms of speech and freedom to press do not guarantee to them the right to print political advertising anonymously.","start":623.726,"stop":635.27,"duration":11.54},{"text":"The First Amendment protects not the written or spoken word itself but the expression of ideas concerning social policy, political views and religious beliefs.","start":635.27,"stop":645.487,"duration":10.22},{"text":"Speech or conduct however that expresses nothing of political or social importance is not subject to First Amendment protection.","start":645.487,"stop":652.822,"duration":7.34},{"text":"As Judge Bue points out in his specially concurring opinion below.","start":652.822,"stop":656.841,"duration":4.02},{"text":"these printers by their actions express nothing.","start":656.841,"stop":660.415,"duration":3.57},{"text":"They do not argue that they are denied the right to print anonymously their own views in support of or in opposition to a particular candidate.","start":660.415,"stop":668.689,"duration":8.27},{"text":"To the contrary, they seek the right to print anonymously that for which they have no feeling one way or the other.","start":668.689,"stop":675.186,"duration":6.5},{"text":"Indeed, they seek to avoid expressing any type of conviction.","start":675.186,"stop":679.264,"duration":4.08},{"text":"They seek constitutional protection to avoid expressing only their name.","start":679.264,"stop":685.356,"duration":6.09},{"text":"Nor did the printer seek to distribute ideas.","start":685.356,"stop":688.413,"duration":3.06},{"text":"They merely received orders from their clientèle and return the finished product to the person that has hired their services.","start":688.413,"stop":697.251,"duration":8.84},{"text":"The appellees rely very heavily in the Tally versus California case to support their position.","start":697.251,"stop":702.067,"duration":4.82},{"text":"We submit that the Tally decision does not in fact support them and is distinguishable from instant case in several very important aspects.","start":702.067,"stop":711.077,"duration":9.01},{"text":"First, the Los Angeles ordinance requiring identification on all handbills were struck down because of over breadth as to time, as to place and as to circumstance and the lack of any relation to any ongoing governmental interest or responsibility.","start":711.077,"stop":727.831,"duration":16.75},{"text":"The challenged language of Article 1410 applies only in very limited times, that being during a campaign and only to certain

eliminate anonymous discussions of public matters of importance at all the times or even during an election campaign.","start":739.667,"stop":747.48,"duration":7.81},{"text":"The purposes articulated by Mr. Justice Black from prohibiting an absolute ban on anonymous printing are far from applicable in the case at bar.","start":747.48,"stop":758.42,"duration":10.94},{"text":"Now appellee printers have no such lofty purpose for seeking anonymity.","start":758.42,"stop":762.766,"duration":4.35},{"text":"Rather, basic only to profit in private even if this were speech that were protected under the First Amendment, as Mr. Justice Clark pointed out in his dissenting opinion in Tally, the Constitution says nothing about freedom of anonymous speech nor there's freedom to press as illustrated in the Lewis Publishing Company case provide any such anonymity.","start":762.766,"stop":786.096,"duration":23.33},{"text":"The Brandsberg decision also illustrates that freedom of press does not

later point here the state's interests are compelling and when weighed in the scales of justice against any possible infringement, may tilt in favor of the voting rights which our state so fervently
