Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":37.81,"stop":40.714,"duration":2.9},{"text":"This case involves a claim of sex discrimination under the Social Security Act.","start":40.714,"stop":45.799,"duration":5.09},{"text":"Section 202 (g) of that Act provides for the payments of benefits to certain widowed mothers.","start":45.799,"stop":52.813,"duration":7.01},{"text":"There is no comparable provision under the Act for payment benefits to widowed fathers.","start":52.813,"stop":58.249,"duration":5.44},{"text":"The appellee in this case is a widowed father who claims that he is constitutionally entitled to the payment benefits on the same basis as if he were a widowed mother.","start":58.249,"stop":69.183,"duration":10.93},{"text":"It is the Government's position as I will elaborate that at some length later that this statute like the property tax exemption in favor of widows in Kahn against Shevin, serves a permissible legislative objective of ameliorating the harsh economic consequences of economic job discrimination against women and that it should be sustained on that basis.","start":69.183,"stop":95.049,"duration":25.87},{"text":"A description of the operation of the Act is essential to an understanding of this case.","start":95.049,"stop":100.099,"duration":5.05},{"text":"The benefits payable under Section 202 (g) are paid out or on account of the Social Security Account of the diseased wage earner.","start":100.099,"stop":109.777,"duration":9.68},{"text":"The widowed mother receives, I think, a benefit equal to three quarters of the primary insurance benefit that the diseased husband would have received had he lived and retired, reduced $0.50 cents for each dollar that the widow earns in excess of $2,400.00 per year.","start":109.777,"stop":128.211,"duration":18.43},{"text":"The payments are made to the widowed mother so long as she has a minor child in her care and remains unmarried.","start":128.211,"stop":135.545,"duration":7.33},{"text":"Similar benefits are provided under the Act to the child of a diseased wage earner.","start":135.545,"stop":141.054,"duration":5.51},{"text":"A child receives benefits on the basis of the Social Security Account of his or her diseased parent, whether or not the parent is the father or the mother, it makes no difference.","start":141.054,"stop":152.732,"duration":11.68},{"text":"But there is no provision under the Act for the payment of benefits to widowed fathers under the age of 60 on the basis of the account of their diseased wives.","start":152.732,"stop":165.584,"duration":12.85},{"text":"The appellee in this case is a young unemployed widower.","start":165.584,"stop":171.019,"duration":5.44},{"text":"After the death of his wife his child began receiving benefits based upon her Social Security Account.","start":171.019,"stop":178.133,"duration":7.11},{"text":"He however, was not entitled to benefits, he I mean the appellee, was not entitled to benefits himself under the Act.","start":178.133,"stop":186.628,"duration":8.49},{"text":"In view of this, he brought present suit for the declaratory and injunctive relief contending that he was constitutionally entitled to a distribution of benefits on the same basis as if he were a widow rather than a widower.","start":186.628,"stop":201.721,"duration":15.09},{"text":"A three-judge court was convened.","start":201.721,"stop":204.383,"duration":2.66},{"text":"The court determined that all sex based classifications are inherently suspect under this Court's two tiered equal protection analysis that is applied in recent years.","start":204.383,"stop":218.341,"duration":13.96},{"text":"The court analyzed the statute and concluded that it did not served a compelling governmental interest.","start":218.341,"stop":225.042,"duration":6.7},{"text":"And accordingly, the court held the statute on constitutional and ordered the payment of benefits to the appellee as if he were a widow.","start":225.042,"stop":234.916,"duration":9.87},{"text":"The court stayed its order pending this appeal and the case is now here on the government's direct appeal.","start":234.916,"stop":242.381,"duration":7.47},{"text":"At the outset, I think it can be said that the District Court clearly erred in applying the compelling governmental interest standard of review.","start":242.381,"stop":252.553,"duration":10.17},{"text":"It has become clear in these Court's decisions in Kahn against Shevin and last week in Schlesinger against Ballard, that sex based classifications are not inherently suspect.","start":252.553,"stop":266.354,"duration":13.8},{"text":"They're not subject to justification only on the basis of a so-called compelling governmental interest.","start":266.354,"stop":273.091,"duration":6.74},{"text":"They are not invalid per se.","start":273.091,"stop":276.459,"duration":3.37},{"text":"This is not to suggest that the traditionally permissive rational basis standard of review is fully appropriate in all sex discrimination cases.","start":276.459,"stop":287.227,"duration":10.77},{"text":"Sex based classifications we believe do merit close judicial scrutiny and they've received it by this Court in the past in Frontiero against Richardson and Reed against Reed.","start":287.227,"stop":299.28,"duration":12.05},{"text":"This Court struck down the sex classifications that merely served the purpose of administrative convenience.","start":299.28,"stop":306.218,"duration":6.94},{"text":"Plus the Court has applied a standard of review which involves a close scrutiny, a scrutiny which is not so strict as to be inevitably fatal.","start":306.218,"stop":317.511,"duration":11.29},{"text":"The rule that the Court seems to be applying is simply that sex based classifications must rest upon some substantial reasonable basis, or as Chief Justice Burger said in the Reed opinion, “Upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation as I will now show the statute here in question easily meets that test.”","start":317.511,"stop":344.753,"duration":27.24},{"text":"Appellee's principle attack on the statute is curiously enough, not from the point of view of the widower who has been denied benefits but rather from the point of view of the female wager who it is alleged is denied of social security coverage for her spouse that would have been granted to a male wager earner.","start":344.753,"stop":371.983,"duration":27.23},{"text":"The appellee's argument proceeds so logistically.","start":371.983,"stop":376.428,"duration":4.44},{"text":"First, the appellee analogizes the payment of Social Security taxes to the purchase of private insurance coverage and the appellee contends that female wager earners are not granted the right to purchase the same insurance coverage that a male wage earner purchases for his spouse under the system.","start":376.428,"stop":397.926,"duration":21.5},{"text":"And appellee's concludes that this discrepancy and treatment -- this discrepancy in insurance coverage is in permissible.","start":397.926,"stop":407.225,"duration":9.3},{"text":"We believe, there are two fatal flaws to this chain of reasoning.","start":407.225,"stop":410.91,"duration":3.69},{"text":"First, the analogy to a private insurance scheme is itself fundamentally erroneous.","start":410.91,"stop":418.58,"duration":7.67},{"text":"As this Court noted in Flemming against Nestor, the Social Security Act comprehends this scheme not of private but of Social Insurance under which, benefits are distributed and coverage provided in large part on the basis of probable need rather than on the basis of strict compe -- rather than strictly on the basis of the contributions that the insured wage earner has paid.","start":418.58,"stop":446.509,"duration":27.93},{"text":"We even, accepting for the moment the private insurer paradigm on which the appellee relies, we think it's nevertheless clear that the female wage earner is not entitled to any additional insurance coverage under the Act that the female wage earner has not been disadvantaged in anyway.","start":446.509,"stop":466.768,"duration":20.26},{"text":"As we pointed out on pages 21 and 22 of our brief, female wage earners under the Social Security system pay in only 28% of all Social Security taxes whereas 34% of the benefits paid out in the system are paid out on the basis of the Social Security accounts of female wage earners.","start":466.768,"stop":493.045,"duration":26.28},{"text":"I'm not talking about the benefits that are paid to women I'm talking about the benefits that are paid out solely on the basis of the women's account as workers.","start":493.045,"stop":502.432,"duration":9.39},{"text":"Now this means that the Social Security System is already out of actuarial balance in favor of female wage earner as against the male wage earner.","start":502.432,"stop":513.549,"duration":11.12},{"text":"If my rough estimatical calculations are correct, right now, the female wage earners receives a 33% greater coverage under the Act, in terms of dollars than does male wage earner.","start":513.549,"stop":526.999,"duration":13.45},{"text":"To grant the additional insurance coverage for which appellee contents here, would simply further tilt the scales in favor of the female wage earner as against her male counter part.","start":526.999,"stop":537.928,"duration":10.93}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"How do you account for the existing disparity?","start":537.928,"stop":542.144,"duration":4.22}]},{"speakerName":"Keith A. Jones","textObjs":[{"text":"I think, in large part the disparity flows from the fact that women have longer life expectancies and that their retirement benefits are spread out over a longer period of time.","start":542.144,"stop":553.486,"duration":11.34},{"text":"They may also be attributable in part to the fact that lower wage earners are entitled to somewhat great return under the Act than are higher wage earners and women statistically are lower wage earners.","start":553.486,"stop":567.953,"duration":14.47},{"text":"Like for those two reasons and I'm not sure which is more important, women do received on the basis of their accounts far greater return than the men.","start":567.953,"stop":580.531,"duration":12.58},{"text":"And our position with respect to this argument, this insurance coverage argument by the appellee is that to grant further coverage, to further tilt the scales in favor of women, obviously would not serve the purposes of the Equal Protection Clause.","start":580.531,"stop":597.064,"duration":16.53},{"text":"It therefore, seems to us that appellee's insurance coverage argument simply reduces to the complaint that appellee's individual wife as a wage earner, unlike the average female wage earner has been somehow disadvantaged that the payments made on the basis of her account are in some sense constitutionally insufficient.","start":597.064,"stop":625.061,"duration":28},{"text":"There's no merit to this argument either legally or factually.","start":625.061,"stop":628.558,"duration":3.5},{"text":"As a factual matter, I think that you can deduce from the record and that it is clear that appellee's son has already or will soon have received greater benefits under the Social Security Act than his wife ever paid into the system, that there is no ground for reviewing her account as being somehow disadvantaged but more fundamental is a legal matter.","start":628.558,"stop":655.432,"duration":26.87},{"text":"There's no basis for an argument that a Social Security contributor has a vested interest in his or her Social Security account.","start":655.432,"stop":665.017,"duration":9.59},{"text":"That argument which obviously is not a sex discrimination argument was firmly rejected by this Court in Flemming against Nestor in language which, I think is equally appropriate here and I would like to quote, “The Social Security System maybe accurately describe as a form of Social Insurance whereby person's gainfully employed and those who employ them are taxed, to permit the payment of benefits to the retired and the disabled and their dependents.”","start":665.017,"stop":692.435,"duration":27.42},{"text":"A non-contractual interest of an employee covered by the Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of a holder of an annuity. His right to benefit is bottomed on his contractual premium payments.","start":692.435,"stop":705.838,"duration":13.4},{"text":"And therefore, I think its clear that appellee's wife as a female wage earner, was not disadvantaged either in her individual capacity or as a member of a class under the Act, that she was not the subject -- was not the victim of any cognizable discrimination under Act.","start":705.838,"stop":726.058,"duration":20.22},{"text":"For that reason, I now turn to the appellee's alternative argument which is based upon the contention that the denial of benefits to a widower constitutes a denial of equal protection to men as an impermissible discrimination against men.","start":726.058,"stop":745.687,"duration":19.63},{"text":"That argument it seems to us, is foreclosed by this Court's decision in Kahn against Shevin.","start":745.687,"stop":752.627,"duration":6.94},{"text":"In that case, this Court upheld a special Florida property tax exemption that was granted only to widows and not to widowers.","start":752.627,"stop":762.982,"duration":10.36},{"text":"The objective of that legislation is like that of the statute here was to ameliorate some degree the economic difficulties that uniquely confront the lone woman who has lost her husband.","start":762.982,"stop":776.487,"duration":13.5},{"text":"The Court in that opinion recited statistics showing that the average female workers are in approximately 40% of the income of the average male worker.","start":776.487,"stop":787.206,"duration":10.72},{"text":"And the Court noted that this disparity in the economic capabilities would be exacerbated in the case of a widow vis-a-vis a widower and that the difference in earning power between a widow and widower was probably even greater to that between women and men generally.","start":787.206,"stop":806.311,"duration":19.11},{"text":"Mr. Justice Douglas writing for the Court in that case observed that while the widower can usually continue in his occupation, in many cases, the widow will suddenly find herself forced into a job market with which she is unfamiliar and in which, because of her former economic dependency, she will have fewer skills to offer.","start":806.311,"stop":827.425,"duration":21.11},{"text":"And it's also clear that, the discrimination inherent in such a statute between widows and widowers is not impermissible.","start":827.425,"stop":836.45,"duration":9.03},{"text":"As Mr. Justice Brennan, who is dissenting on other grounds in that case, observed it's permissible to distinguish between widows and widowers because only the former and not the latter are subject to discrimination as a class.","start":836.45,"stop":851.796,"duration":15.35},{"text":"And if I may quote again from the descending opinion, “Inclusion of needy widowers would not further the state's overriding interest in remedying the economic effects of past sex discrimination of needy victims of that discrimination.","start":851.796,"stop":866.149,"duration":14.35},{"text":"No doubt some widowers are in financial need, no one suggests that such need results from sex discrimination.”","start":866.149,"stop":874.014,"duration":7.87},{"text":"On the basis of these considerations, the Court in this case, Kahn against Shevin, upheld the Florida statute as resting upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.","start":874.014,"stop":891.31,"duration":17.3},{"text":"Well, precisely the same considerations govern this case.","start":891.31,"stop":895.698,"duration":4.39},{"text":"Congress recognized that the probable need of widows is greater than that of widowers and then enacted Section 202 (g) to provide for that need.","start":895.698,"stop":906.495,"duration":10.8},{"text":"In doing so, Congress merely acted as it has also done in behalf of other persons such as aged dependent parents, who cannot be fairly expected to replace by their own efforts in the job market the loss of support that has been occasioned by the death of a family wage earner.","start":906.495,"stop":927.433,"duration":20.94},{"text":"Moreover, this provision, Section 202 (g), does not suffer from the vice of over inclusiveness that led two justices of this Court to descent from the ruling in Kahn.","start":927.433,"stop":940.44,"duration":13.01},{"text":"The amount of the benefits payable under Section 202 (g) is inversely correlated to the amount of the widow's earnings.","start":940.44,"stop":947.906,"duration":7.47},{"text":"So that the women, who has in fact successfully surmounted, sexual job discrimination is not provided benefits under this Act.","start":947.906,"stop":958.688,"duration":10.78},{"text":"Similarly, benefits are provided only to the widow with a minor child in her care for whom the economic consequences or job discrimination are heightened by the fact that she must additionally provide competent child care during the working hours.","start":958.688,"stop":977.145,"duration":18.46},{"text":"At the same time, the benefits provided under the statute are considerably more substantial than those that were granted by the property tax exemption in Kahn.","start":977.145,"stop":988.232,"duration":11.09},{"text":"Therefore, it seems clear to us that Section 202 (g) serves the permissible legislative objective of ameliorating the economic consequences of the employment discrimination that widows with children suffer with heightened severity, and that does both more thoroughly, and more carefully than the statute at Kahn against Shevin.","start":988.232,"stop":1012.129,"duration":23.9},{"text":"I would add at this point only one final point.","start":1012.129,"stop":1017.419,"duration":5.29},{"text":"At the bottom, the appellee's argument here is that benefits under the Social Security Act must be distributed without regard to sex equally to men and women in all cases.","start":1017.419,"stop":1030.732,"duration":13.31},{"text":"Although, we realize that program costs cannot be determined even a case such as this, we feel that it is nevertheless not without some significance that the cost of achieving this objective of paying out all benefits without regards to sex would be approximately $350,000,000.00 additional dollars per year.","start":1030.732,"stop":1051.524,"duration":20.79},{"text":"Now these statistics are set fort on page 15 of the appendix.","start":1051.524,"stop":1056.771,"duration":5.25},{"text":"This additional money would have to come from somewhere.","start":1056.771,"stop":1059.607,"duration":2.84},{"text":"The Social Security System is supposed to remain in actuarial balance.","start":1059.607,"stop":1064.065,"duration":4.46},{"text":"Therefore, to pay out these additional benefits either Social Security taxes would have to be increased or some other benefit group with the benefits payable to some other group would have to be reduced.","start":1064.065,"stop":1078.748,"duration":14.68},{"text":"In this context, that we feel that this Court's statement in Dandridge against Williams is particularly appropriate.","start":1078.748,"stop":1086.249,"duration":7.5},{"text":"That is that it does not sit to second guess officials charged with difficult responsibility of allocating scarce public welfare funds among the merit of potential recipients.","start":1086.249,"stop":1098.963,"duration":12.71},{"text":"Now, to apply a judicial restrain of this kind in a case like this is not however to place the Social Security System in the iron grip of the status quo.","start":1098.963,"stop":1115.079,"duration":16.12},{"text":"Congress has recently considered sex based classifications under the Act and it has amended the statute to eliminate one of the major sex based classifications like providing for the equalization of the method of computing retirement benefits for men and women.","start":1115.079,"stop":1134.126,"duration":19.05},{"text":"And it may well act to further reduce or ultimately entirely eliminate all sex classifications under the Act.","start":1134.126,"stop":1143.47,"duration":9.34},{"text":"But for the present we feel that it's clear that the exclusion of widowers under Section 202 (g) lies well within Congress' constitutional power to allocate welfare funds.","start":1143.47,"stop":1156.839,"duration":13.37},{"text":"For these reasons we respectfully submit that the judgment below should be
