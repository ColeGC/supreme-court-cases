to the Board's Regional Directors of whom there are some 30th, the authority initially took process unfair labor process charges.","start":178.815,"stop":191.021,"duration":12.21},{"text":"When a charge is filed with one of the Regional Directors he investigates that he ordinarily will interrogate witnesses, look at documents and so

do.","start":200.597,"stop":204.853,"duration":4.26},{"text":"First, he may conclude that there is nothing here that warrants the issuance of a complaint and he decides not to issue a complaint.","start":204.853,"stop":213.893,"duration":9.04},{"text":"Secondly, he may conclude on the basis of his investigation that there's enough here to warrant the issuance of a complaint and he issues the complaint.","start":213.893,"stop":220.577,"duration":6.68},{"text":"Or third, he may submit the merit to the General Counsel's Office in Washington for advice on whether or not he should issue a complaint.","start":220.577,"stop":230.032,"duration":9.46},{"text":"The General Counsel has put out instructions to the Regional Directors that they are to refer two categories of cases to Washington for advice.","start":230.032,"stop":240.374,"duration":10.34},{"text":"One, case that present novel or complex problems or two, cases that involve certain issues which the General Counsel has specified should be submitted to him in Washington in order to assure a uniform prosecutorial policy with respect to these cases.","start":240.374,"stop":260.136,"duration":19.76},{"text":"Now, when the General Counsel receives from the Regional Director a request for advice, the matter submitted to something called the Office of Appeals in the General Counsel's Office where the case is thoroughly and carefully reviewed by a number of people.","start":260.136,"stop":278.561,"duration":18.42},{"text":"And this review process culminates in something called an “Advice Memorandum”, in which the General Counsel sometimes act himself more frequently acting through the man in charge of the Office of Advice, advices the Regional Director on whether or not he should issue a complaint.","start":278.561,"stop":299.202,"duration":20.64},{"text":"This Advice Memoranda, the General Counsel gives the reasons for his decision, discusses the evidence of the case, analyzes Board precedents and if the advice is that a complaint should issue generally gives the theory upon which he believes the case should proceed.","start":299.202,"stop":318.861,"duration":19.66},{"text":"Now, although the representative examples that are included in the record of Advice Memoranda contain nothing making any reference to the possibility of settlements.","start":318.861,"stop":331.939,"duration":13.08},{"text":"The report -- the two reports in this record presented by the Practice and Procedure Committee of the Labor Law Section of the American Bar Association on which Sears relies very heavily.","start":331.939,"stop":344.708,"duration":12.77},{"text":"And in one of those reports, set forth at page 71 of the appendix, the Committee which represents of course the experts in this field both on the labor and the management side, recognizes that not infrequently, this Advice Memoranda will refer to settlement possibilities.","start":344.708,"stop":365.349,"duration":20.64},{"text":"It's in the middle of page 71 and the statement is, “the response to the region will sometimes include specifics with respect to the kind of settlement or other action and will set forth the theories upon which such cause of action is based.”","start":365.349,"stop":380.903,"duration":15.55},{"text":"And I stressed that because the ultimate question in the case is what these things are.","start":380.903,"stop":385.891,"duration":4.99},{"text":"Are they just a statement of legal position or do they involve something more.","start":385.891,"stop":393.243,"duration":7.35},{"text":"They basically reflect to the strategy, the litigation strategy of the General Counsel has recommended be followed.","start":393.243,"stop":401.291,"duration":8.05},{"text":"And we think the fact that they refer to settlement negotiations and suggest a basis upon settlement, to us is very clear evidence of that.","start":401.291,"stop":409.593,"duration":8.3},{"text":"Now, if the Regional Director should decide not to issue a complaint either because of the advice he has received from the General Counsel or because his own investigation indicates that a complaint is not appropriate, then the charging party has the right to appeal that determination to the General Counsel.","start":409.593,"stop":431.078,"duration":21.48},{"text":"The matter is then similarly reviewed except by different office by something called the Office of Appeals.","start":431.078,"stop":438.043,"duration":6.97},{"text":"If the Office of Appeals upholds the Regional Director's determination, it so advises him and the parties that there are rather brief statement giving the reasons for his decision.","start":438.043,"stop":449.222,"duration":11.18},{"text":"If however, the Regional Counsel is reversed and the General Counsel concludes that a complaint should issue, they then prepare something called an Appeals Memoranda.","start":449.222,"stop":460.176,"duration":10.95},{"text":"And the Appeals Memoranda is similar to the Advice Memoranda and that it too describes the case suggest theories, gives the reasoning of the General Counsel.","start":460.176,"stop":471.794,"duration":11.62},{"text":"Now, it's these two categories
