and secondly, if indeed such a right exists or can be implied from the statute whether or not this receiver has the standing to maintain such an action.","start":247.079,"stop":287.054,"duration":39.97},{"text":"Our position essentially is that the grant to the SEC of this extraordinary remedy of enforcement over SIPC in order to compel it, to perform its statutory responsibilities is clearly an exclusive grant of a very extraordinary power and an extraordinary remedy, our position is that there is nothing in the legislative history or in the statute itself to suggest the contrary.","start":287.054,"stop":323.102,"duration":36.05},{"text":"Indeed our position is that an analysis of the statute, and its purpose, and its legislative history would clearly indicate that Congress indeed are fashion and created a special supervisory tool, placed it in the hands of the commission and indeed expected that no member of the general public would simultaneously enjoy that considerable hour.","start":323.102,"stop":350.754,"duration":27.65},{"text":"We depend on a statutory analysis, we have course look to certain maxims of construction but in my opinion to the extent we look to principles of construction, there only really assistance to what I regard as ineluctable conclusion.","start":350.754,"stop":368.919,"duration":18.16},{"text":"Because the job of an analysis is far better than in writing and in briefs, I would not attempt to detail too much of the contents of the brief we file.","start":368.919,"stop":379.791,"duration":10.87},{"text":"I would like however, to focus on three aspects of the statute which I consider to be most helpful and most critical.","start":379.791,"stop":392.141,"duration":12.35},{"text":"Firstly, I would like to mention briefly the purpose of the legislation.","start":392.141,"stop":399.671,"duration":7.53},{"text":"It was enacted in -- effective December 1970, in the wake of a considerable number of broker-dealer failures in the bad years of 1967, 68', 69', 70'.","start":399.671,"stop":415.067,"duration":15.4},{"text":"The thrust and purpose was to bolster investor confidence in the securities markets and by this 1970 Act, Congress attacked the problem in a number of ways, some were affirmative and some were negative.","start":415.067,"stop":433.474,"duration":18.41},{"text":"It certainly enhanced the commission's power to promulgate and enforced financial responsibility rules for brokers and dealers.","start":433.474,"stop":444.312,"duration":10.84},{"text":"It gave the commission the power to impose on self-regulatory organizations, the duty to adopt additional rules of any kind.","start":444.312,"stop":454.376,"duration":10.06},{"text":"It looked to the improvement of the examination and inspection procedures of the self-regulatory organizations to assure compliance with rules affecting financial responsibility and to detect early as possible approaching financial difficulty.","start":454.376,"stop":471.54,"duration":17.16},{"text":"They directed the commissions and conduct the study in unsafe and unsound practices which he did.","start":471.54,"stop":477.881,"duration":6.34},{"text":"And finally, part and possible this attack on the problem of investor confidence, it did create SIPC.","start":477.881,"stop":487.393,"duration":9.51},{"text":"It created it as a non-industry or rather a nonprofit industry funded membership corporation. It provided specifically it would not be a Government agency.","start":487.393,"stop":499.327,"duration":11.93},{"text":"It created it so that in the event these attempts to avoid failures were not successful in certain cases.","start":499.327,"stop":509.323,"duration":10},{"text":"Public confidence could be boosted by the notion that there is an organization after all which stands behind the failure of that type with its funds.","start":509.323,"stop":519.888,"duration":10.57},{"text":"It created an organization funded by the industry with only the possibility of a call and federal money.","start":519.888,"stop":527.206,"duration":7.32},{"text":"And it created a corporation with a board of directors which is prescribed by statute, a responsible one in my opinion of balance to one.","start":527.206,"stop":539.11,"duration":11.9},{"text":"There is not federal dominance.","start":539.11,"stop":540.783,"duration":1.67},{"text":"There is not industry

in the brief to indicate how they selected.","start":545.331,"stop":550.472,"duration":5.14},{"text":"The second point that I would like to emphasize is the means by which public customers are protected when brokers and dealers do fail who are members of SIPC.","start":550.472,"stop":564.785,"duration":14.31},{"text":"There is a dependence on the part of SIPC on the information and cooperation of the self-regulatory organizations and the SEC, they are the ones who the examining authority.","start":564.785,"stop":578.434,"duration":13.65},{"text":"They are the ones who receive the reports, we do none.","start":578.434,"stop":582.613,"duration":4.18},{"text":"However under our statute, they have the obligation when they the facts which lead them to believe that perhaps a firm is approaching difficulty to report those facts to us.","start":582.613,"stop":596.998,"duration":14.38},{"text":"And as that's done, if the situation appears to warrant the critical analysis on the basis of the available facts, we do that and we look to our statute which authorizes us to do the following.","start":596.998,"stop":613.809,"duration":16.81},{"text":"If one or five statutory conditions exist and it is spell that in the statute, for example, insolvency.","start":613.809,"stop":622.52,"duration":8.71},{"text":"To some extent noncompliance with applicable regulations in the commission and if the firm has failed, there's in danger of failing to meet its obligations to customers.","start":622.52,"stop":633.721,"duration":11.2},{"text":"SIPC is vested with the discretion to make an applications to the District Court in the appropriate jurisdiction, seeking adjudication that customer require protection, seeking the appointment of a trustee in liquidation and there where I will provide in the protection contemplated by the statute.","start":633.721,"stop":658.296,"duration":24.58},{"text":"So, the ministerial act that the statute talks about, it doesn't amount to a congressional direction that is doesn't so exist you must would allow so flexibility.","start":658.296,"stop":672.022,"duration":13.73},{"text":"The perimeters of which I don't think are involved today and have not been determine in any event.","start":672.022,"stop":678.721,"duration":6.7},{"text":"The proceeding that is brought is essentially involuntary bankruptcy proceeding.","start":678.721,"stop":683.878,"duration":5.16},{"text":"The statute expands on the powers of a Court of bankruptcy by allowing certain chapter 10 powers and provisions to become operative through in corporation by reference.","start":683.878,"stop":696.043,"duration":12.16},{"text":"But essentially, reorganization is prohibited, it is truly a straight involuntary bankruptcy proceeding base to some extent insofar as customer's substantive rights are concerned on Section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act and I don't feel it's appropriate to get into that detail at the moment.","start":696.043,"stop":715.991,"duration":19.95},{"text":"I think what is really new about this particular proceeding, at least two of them more important aspects would be this, because the Congress was concern about a possible domino effect in the industry by the failure of one firm.","start":715.991,"stop":731.44,"duration":15.45},{"text":"It did authorize the completion of open contractual commitments between the firm and liquidation, and another broker-dealer.","start":731.44,"stop":739.897,"duration":8.46},{"text":"More important and most remain here by the statute, the funds of the member in liquidation the estate is no longer the only source from which a customer's claim and bankruptcy maybe satisfied.","start":739.897,"stop":756.395,"duration":16.5},{"text":"Under the statute SIPC funds now whether certain prescribe limits will augment the estate.","start":756.395,"stop":763.731,"duration":7.34},{"text":"It is if you will a method of collection bonds of for our substantive rights are concern not that much difference between Section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act in our statute.","start":763.731,"stop":777.729,"duration":14},{"text":"There are differences however.","start":777.729,"stop":780.662,"duration":2.93},{"text":"So, this is the proceeding, this is the relief that it is alleged and claimed here by the receiver.","start":780.662,"stop":789.624,"duration":8.96},{"text":"SIPC should by reason of its obligations have initiated and commenced.","start":789.624,"stop":796.323,"duration":6.7},{"text":"The third aspect I would look to an oral argument is the commission supervision under the statute.","start":796.323,"stop":804.619,"duration":8.3},{"text":"In some respects, the SEC is to use of

Caron","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":15.077,"stop":17.876,"duration":2.8},{"text":"At the close of yesterday's argument, I was at the point of discussing briefly the supervisory powers of the commission and its Section 7 (b) enforcement remedy which is so directly involved in this particular case and from that point to discuss the cases which is sited by the respondent in support of his position.","start":17.876,"stop":43.752,"duration":25.88},{"text":"We have emphasized in the brief the overall supervisory responsibilities of the commission over SIPC.","start":43.752,"stop":52.802,"duration":9.05},{"text":"They're extensive and they are detailed at least 10 specifications at pages 10 to 12 of our brief and I would not burden the Court will a repetition of those items.","start":52.802,"stop":65.522,"duration":12.72},{"text":"I would illustrate one now to indicate the under the swipe the commission does have the power under the statute to disapprove any by law or any rule of regulation which SIPC might adopt and more than that it has the power to compel SIPC to adopt the by law at desire be adopted with the same applies to rules and has the power to require SIPC to repeal or amend any existing by law.","start":65.522,"stop":95.551,"duration":30.03},{"text":"So, that is one illustration of the pervasive control which the Congress has saw to lodge and properly so in the commission and there are other examples.","start":95.551,"stop":106.689,"duration":11.14},{"text":"And we find that Section 7 (b) which relates the enforcement of SIPC's statutory responsibilities to the investing public.","start":106.689,"stop":116.892,"duration":10.2},{"text":"We find that provision is part in puzzle of packages of supervision.","start":116.892,"stop":123.007,"duration":6.12},{"text":"It's clear from the remarks of the members of the Congress or at least some of them and we report to some of those that Footnote 30 or page 11 of our brief that they well understood and intended that the commission assume on exclusive basis responsibility the suit was that the purposes of the Act would carried out in every respect.","start":123.007,"stop":147.914,"duration":24.91},{"text":"I would point to one just to illustrate one Congressman in these words, “The bill gives to the Securities and Exchange Commission continuing over side and rule making authority over the affairs of the corporation to ensure that the public interest is served.”","start":147.914,"stop":169.166,"duration":21.25},{"text":"In light of the receivers authorities cited in support of an implied right of action, I would focus just for a moment on the extraordinary character of the remedy and enforcement power which the commission has.","start":169.166,"stop":185.513,"duration":16.35},{"text":"Section 7 (b) in the first instance would authorize the commission to substitute its judgment for that of SIPC Board of Directors in the event that disagree and on the basis of that difference of view, authorizes the commission to go the Federal District Court where our principal office is located and commence an action, perhaps describable as in the nature of mandamus or mandatory injunction.","start":185.513,"stop":216.528,"duration":31.01},{"text":"But not quite the one I don't believe and it authorizes the Court after reviewing the positions of SIPC and the commission to determine within some parameters not yet establish that either the commission is correct and that SIPC should be compelled to do something under the Act namely commission liquidation proceeding or otherwise.","start":216.528,"stop":245.092,"duration":28.56},{"text":"And if the relief is granted what is happening as I indicated yesterday is the compulsion of a proceeding on an involuntary basis to liquidate a broker dealer with all the impact that has and then the process triggering the release of the funds in SIPC for the purposes of the proceeding and in the event that its on funds should proven adequate either by reason of that case or a combination circumstances triggering a call by way of a barrowing on the US Treasury.","start":245.092,"stop":279.462,"duration":34.37},{"text":"Those are the dimension of the remedy which the commission enjoys by express grant.","start":279.462,"stop":286.717,"duration":7.25},{"text":"The receivers position, if I understand correctly, is that by reason of the broad purposes of the 70 Act an equivalent and duplicate remedy for precise in the same purposes should be implied and that's the term I believe should be implied in favor of the customers of a firm which may in their judgment feel that the firm is in certain -- die a circumstances and that SIPC should commence a liquidation proceeding.","start":286.717,"stop":321.373,"duration":34.66},{"text":"It brings to bare two principles cases really.","start":321.373,"stop":328.748,"duration":7.38},{"text":"One on which, we rely and namely the National Railroad Passenger Corporation case driver forged and when the brief is the Amtrak case.","start":328.748,"stop":338.476,"duration":9.73},{"text":"On the other hand, the receiver would focus on J.I. case against Borak reported at 377 US.","start":338.476,"stop":349.034,"duration":10.56},{"text":"Borak is one of a line of cases, the receiver also site Allen against the Board of Education.","start":349.034,"stop":356.062,"duration":7.03},{"text":"We in turn supply on that line of cases, Warned that Transportation Co. against United State, Bivens against Six Unknown Named Agents, Texas against and Pacific against Rigsby, Fleishman Distilling and we do that for the purpose of attempting an analysis of what these cases really mean.","start":356.062,"stop":380.223,"duration":24.16},{"text":"So far as I can determine, that analysis indicates that they involve a determination of whether a remedy traditionally recognized by the judiciary should be denied a particular litigant who was agreed by the Act of another in violation of the statutory duty, a wrong and a traditional sense of tort.","start":380.223,"stop":407.968,"duration":27.75},{"text":"Allen for example, involved a deprivation for a voting right, Bivens the violation of the Fourth Amendment right against search and seizure, Borak, a violation of the proxy requirements of Section 14 (a) of the 34 Act, Fleishman, a violation of the provision to the land of Act which prohibit infringement on trademarks.","start":407.968,"stop":430.735,"duration":22.77},{"text":"Rigsby, a violation of federal Safety Appliance Act and wind that a violation by reason of the negligence seeking of a vessel, a violation in the Section 15 who delivers on Harbor Act, so on all these cases and I'm certainly there are others.","start":430.735,"stop":446.999,"duration":16.26},{"text":"Essentially, what is involved is a wrong in the classic sense of Tort, committed against one in violation of law and the search in the cases has been whether be a constitutional provision as in Bivens or a statutory provision as in the other cases.","start":446.999,"stop":469.294,"duration":22.29},{"text":"The inquiry has been has Congress accept from Bivens has Congress by prescribing particular remedies foreclose available traditional remedies for example, damages, recession, injunction.","start":469.294,"stop":489.672,"duration":20.38},{"text":"In Bivens, there was -- in my opinion this is because there was a right and no particular remedy prescribed hence on, I think traditional basis, a cause of action for damages forth injury committed and all the other cases I've cited except Fleishman.","start":489.672,"stop":510.151,"duration":20.48},{"text":"While there were certain remedies of a penal of civil nature.","start":510.151,"stop":514.203,"duration":4.05},{"text":"The fact was as this Court found that the prescription of certain remedies was on a sufficient indication of a congressional intent to foreclose existing traditional remedies.","start":514.203,"stop":531.087,"duration":16.88},{"text":"In Fleishman, because of what this Court describe as the prescription of intricate remedies, it felt that Congress had indeed intended to foreclose the possibility of considering in award for attorneys fees in an action under that statute.","start":531.087,"stop":555.214,"duration":24.13},{"text":"So, that we have this suitable tread of rational; I would refer to some language in Bivens and Wind up for example in Bivens.","start":555.214,"stop":566.062,"duration":10.85},{"text":"The Court stated historically damages
