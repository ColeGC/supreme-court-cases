about.","start":349.341,"stop":360.695,"duration":11.35},{"text":"The District Court granted the plaintiff below the monetary damages requested which was $250.00 for each composition at the statutory rate.","start":360.695,"stop":370.454,"duration":9.76},{"text":"As I've already stated, the Court of Appeals reversed that and I submit that I can state with confidence that the business purpose behind the selection of any one of the methods by which Aiken could have supplied musical entertainment to his guests and employees was identical.","start":370.454,"stop":398.096,"duration":27.64},{"text":"It was to entertain guests and it was to improve the efficiency of his employees.","start":398.096,"stop":402.997,"duration":4.9},{"text":"This much I believe is clear on the record, and all of these methods which ever one he selected would have to have recourse to music created by composers and made available to the public by means of either cheap music, records, tapes,piano roles or broadcast of electrical impulses.","start":402.997,"stop":425.531,"duration":22.53},{"text":"And I suggest that until the Third Circuit had spoken, it was firmly established that no matter by which method Aiken entertained his guests and employees, he was bound to abstain unless he had a license from the copyright owner, such as ASCAP of course.","start":425.531,"stop":456.019,"duration":30.49},{"text":"And of course such licenses were universally available under the compulsion of a decree which is enforced with respect to ASCAP.","start":456.019,"stop":465.177,"duration":9.16},{"text":"I believe that it is still unquestioned that live performances in the restaurant by live musicians would be subject to the copyright laws and subject to Section 1 thereof, and that has been true certainly since Mr. Justice Holmes wrote Herbert against Shanley way back in 1917.","start":465.177,"stop":493.549,"duration":28.37},{"text":"I believe it is still unquestioned that the record, tape, piano role method or electronic method of music is a public performance for profit, and indeed so the Third Circuit itself had held on a number of times.","start":493.549,"stop":510.807,"duration":17.26},{"text":"And now the Third Circuit has decided that the last method, namely the radio plus loudspeaker method, although realistically and functionally indistinguishable from any of the other methods of furnishing the music, is for some reason beyond the reach of Section 1 of the Copyright Act although it is public, although it is for profit, but the Circuit Court said it is not a performance, and at arriving at that conclusion that it was not a performance, it said that it acted under the composure of this Court's mandate as expressed in the two CATV cases, the Fortnightly case and the Teleprompter case and it is that determination of the Court of Appeals that I most distinctly want to challenge.","start":510.807,"stop":570.482,"duration":59.67},{"text":"We challenge it and we challenge that decision on several grounds.","start":570.482,"stop":576.393,"duration":5.91},{"text":"We assert first that the old landmark decision rendered in 1931 entitled Buck against Jewell-LaSalle and reported in 283 U.S. by a majority court in an opinion written by Mr. Justice Brandeis, controls this case and that the judgment therefore should have gone for the petitioner.","start":576.393,"stop":603.037,"duration":26.64},{"text":"We also assert that Buck against Jewell-LaSalle can coexist in the same legal universe as Fortnightly and Teleprompter and that there is no incompatibility between them because Fortnightly and Teleprompter unlike this case, were concerned with a new technological development, never prior thereto with -- brought within the copyright system and never subjected to copyright royalty burdens and respect of which Congress had been quite silent.","start":603.037,"stop":646.37,"duration":43.33},{"text":"And thirdly, that in any event, private arrangements have for over 40 years been made between the creators and consumers of mucic in reliance on Jewell-LaSalle and that Jewell-LaSalle therefore ought to be allowed to survive until Congress directs otherwise.","start":646.37,"stop":676.135,"duration":29.76},{"text":"As far as the congressional voice is concerned, if I can read the incomplete compositions of that -- of those body, I can say that it seems to be targeted towards the continued viability of the doctrines of Jewell-LaSalle.","start":676.135,"stop":699.651,"duration":23.52},{"text":"Now, to develop some of those points a little more explicitly, in a sense, this case is of course concerned with the construction of a section of the Copyright Law, Section 1 thereof.","start":699.651,"stop":715.287,"duration":15.64},{"text":"And that is of primary interest to the authors, composers and publishers of music whom the founding fathers expressed the desire to encourage in the Copyright and Patent Clause of the Constitution.","start":715.287,"stop":730.715,"duration":15.43},{"text":"But from the point of view of the development of our jurisprudence, I believe that more is involved than whether respondent Aiken has to pay $5.00 a month for the privilege of entertaining his business guests and improving the morale of his employees with music created by the copyright owners.","start":730.715,"stop":750.259,"duration":19.54},{"text":"I suppose that the statute means exactly what this course declares it means.","start":750.259,"stop":757.62,"duration":7.36},{"text":"And as I've stated a little while ago, ever since 1931, which is 44 years ago, the meaning of that statute was made plain in the case that I have cited Buck against Jewell-LaSalle.","start":757.62,"stop":774.568,"duration":16.95},{"text":"It declared that Section 1 meant that one situated exactly like Aiken in this case and who did exactly what Aiken did in this case subjected himself to liability as an infringer of copyright, unless he was licensed to do what he did.","start":774.568,"stop":798.741,"duration":24.17},{"text":"The Court of Appeals in its analysis acknowledged that the case here under review is an all force with the facts of the case in Jewell-LaSalle.","start":798.741,"stop":818.013,"duration":19.27},{"text":"Over 5000 contracts are now extent that we know of which have been entered into in reliance and in observance of Jewell-LaSalle, and in that case Mr. Justice Brandeis for a unanimous court said “There is no difference” -- we give you the exact language if I may.","start":818.013,"stop":846.964,"duration":28.95},{"text":"“There is no difference in substance between the case where a hotel engages an orchestra to furnish the music, and that where by means of the radio set and loudspeakers here employed, it furnishes the same music for the same purpose.”","start":846.964,"stop":864.868,"duration":17.9}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E. Burger","textObjs":[{"text":"Is not there one difference, Mr. Rifkind, in this sense possibly, to the question, do you think there's a difference since the radio station is selling advertising, presumably, and I would assume that as a matter of economics, the advertising rate is based upon the coverage of the radio station that it differs from the orchestra in the sense that the orchestra has no advertising, and the radio station is getting -- radio station having paid the royalty is getting a larger income because of the standard audience of restaurants, hotels, business establishments, etcetera.","start":864.868,"stop":916.724,"duration":51.86}]},{"speakerName":"Simion H. Rifkind","textObjs":[{"text":"Let me explain that most explicitly.","start":916.724,"stop":919.896,"duration":3.17},{"text":"The rates established between the licensing organization, in this case ASCAP, which speaks for the owners of these compositions and the radio industry is determined under a system which is subject to judicial surveillance under the decree in United States against ASCAP, which has been administered in the Southern District of New York since 1940 and amended in 1950.","start":919.896,"stop":947.196,"duration":27.3},{"text":"If my history, if my recollection of the dates is correct and I believe it is.","start":947.196,"stop":952.534,"duration":5.34},{"text":"Those terms are negotiated in terms of what rights are conferred upon the broadcaster.","start":952.534,"stop":959.29,"duration":6.76},{"text":"In this particular situation, broadcasters are expressly excluded from the right of conferring any authority upon people in Aiken's position, and consequently the rate that they pay takes into account the fact that ASCAP will collect another fee from the Aikens of this country, and therefore the fee paid by the broadcasters does not overlap the fee paid by the Aikens.","start":959.29,"stop":989.806,"duration":30.52},{"text":"The District Court and the Court of Appeals both agreed that the circumstance that the radio station in Jewell-LaSalle was unlicensed and that here it was licensed was a difference without significance.","start":989.806,"stop":1008.006,"duration":18.2},{"text":"The -- I've explained why the suggestion that Mr. Justice Brandeis made in the footnote, as I believe Mr. Justice Rehnquist called attention that there might conceivably be -- the argument might be made that there's an implied license is no longer valid because in 1932 that was explicitly excluded.","start":1008.006,"stop":1030.424,"duration":22.42},{"text":"Logically, I should say, the suggestion of an implied license underscores the conclusion that the hotel or Aiken was performing and performing publicly for profit, because if it was not performing or not performing publicly for profit, there'd be no point in talking about a license.","start":1030.424,"stop":1052.806,"duration":22.38},{"text":"It's only public performance for profit that requires a license, so Mr. Justice Brandeis' discussion of a possible implied license necessarily emphasizes his view that there was a performance and of course a performance for profit.","start":1052.806,"stop":1070.16,"duration":17.35},{"text":"Now, the Third Circuit seemed to be under the impression that Jewell-LaSalle had been overruled by this Court.","start":1070.16,"stop":1080.148,"duration":9.99},{"text":"And I believe that therein, again I find myself in sharp disagreement with that Court.","start":1080.148,"stop":1088.006,"duration":7.86},{"text":"I suppose it can not be challenged that this Court has never yet uttered the talismanic phrase which actually would decanonize Jewell-LaSalle.","start":1088.006,"stop":1100.403,"duration":12.4},{"text":"This Court had said in Fortnightly that Jewell-LaSalle should be understood as limited to its own facts.","start":1100.403,"stop":1112.046,"duration":11.64},{"text":"The facts here are the very facts to which the Court said it should be limited to, and that is the very converse of treating it as overruled.","start":1112.046,"stop":1125.293,"duration":13.25},{"text":"Words of limitation to facts, a phrase not unusual in the opinions of this Court, I've always thought meant that the principle of the case may no longer be regarded as an axiom from which new theorems and new propositions might logically be deduced.","start":1125.293,"stop":1149.418,"duration":24.13},{"text":"The Court of Appeals went much further than that.","start":1149.418,"stop":1151.751,"duration":2.33},{"text":"It has acted in reliance on the anticipation that this Court will overrule Jewell, and we entertain the hope that that prophecy is not a valid one.","start":1151.751,"stop":1165.707,"duration":13.96},{"text":"Be contend that the Court should not overrule Jewell.","start":1165.707,"stop":1169.727,"duration":4.02},{"text":"Indeed we assert that this case presents a conspicuous example of the salutary purposes of the rule of stare decisis.","start":1169.727,"stop":1181.95,"duration":12.22},{"text":"For instance, I've already mentioned, very many people have shaped their business conduct in observance of and in reliance on that case.","start":1181.95,"stop":1194.16,"duration":12.21},{"text":"Moreover, the rule offends no moral principle.","start":1194.16,"stop":1199.245,"duration":5.08},{"text":"It does not offend good judgment as is evidenced by the fact that all over the world, Jewell-LaSalle is in fact lived by and if it should appear that this Court thinks that some different policy should now prevail, it seems to me that the proper agency to grapple with that is the Congress, and indeed the Congress is grappling with that problem at this very moment.","start":1199.245,"stop":1230.371,"duration":31.13},{"text":"As Your Honors know, the Copyright Act has been under active consideration by the Congress for some time, and the delay in the new bill has been not Jewell-LaSalle, but the delay has been caused by the inability of the Congress to decide what to do about CATV.","start":1230.371,"stop":1249.773,"duration":19.4},{"text":"Fortnightly, the first CATV case, was the first occasion on which the Jewell decision was ever questioned in this Court.","start":1249.773,"stop":1261.748,"duration":11.98},{"text":"In that case, there were a number -- there was one dissent and three nonparticipants.","start":1261.748,"stop":1269.311,"duration":7.56},{"text":"In that case the Court confronted a brand new industry which had never been subjected to the copyright system, a new technology.","start":1269.311,"stop":1281.047,"duration":11.74},{"text":"And then in 1974, the Court encountered another further development of that same technology in Fortnightly which brought signals beyond the realm of the original antennae.","start":1281.047,"stop":1294.525,"duration":13.48},{"text":"But neither of the majority nor the minority in either of those cases suggested that Jewell should be overruled.","start":1294.525,"stop":1301.931,"duration":7.41},{"text":"The majority never even mentioned Jewell in the last Teleprompter case, and no justice to express the thought that hotel keepers and restaurateurs were free to entertain guests and stimulate employees by the free use of their music.","start":1301.931,"stop":1320.833,"duration":18.9},{"text":"Aiken's behavior belongs to the unsophisticated realm of what we are fully familiar with, and it wouldn't be a bad idea therefore to see how the world regards that kind of behavior.","start":1320.833,"stop":1334.85,"duration":14.02},{"text":"I shall be brief and say that Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, France, Germany and every other country I could find any evidence of treats Aiken's performance as a breach of the copyright privilege.","start":1334.85,"stop":1352.986,"duration":18.14},{"text":"In the functional sense which is the idea introduced into this field by the decisions in Fortnightly and Teleprompter, comparison was made to the viewer erecting a giant antennae.","start":1352.986,"stop":1371.188,"duration":18.2},{"text":"And I would like to suggest that another way to look at it would be as if it was a giant ear trumpet which made it possible for the listener to get signals which otherwise he couldn't hear.","start":1371.188,"stop":1382.069,"duration":10.88},{"text":"And here's the point I want to make the distinction between those two kinds of cases.","start":1382.069,"stop":1386.757,"duration":4.69},{"text":"The purveyor of ear trumpets doesn't exploit music even though he sells them on the lobby of the opera house, but the furnisher of
