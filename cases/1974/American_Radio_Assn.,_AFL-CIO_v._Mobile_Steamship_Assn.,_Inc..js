Court.","start":26.413,"stop":30.914,"duration":4.5},{"text":"I find myself back again in a return voyage, it appears like in the -- on behalf of Merchant seamen.","start":30.914,"stop":37.928,"duration":7.01},{"text":"It was initially I was here and on behalf of questions of their rights under the Federal Labor Act and we have an additional point today which presented to the Court of the free speech First Amendment rights.","start":37.928,"stop":53.363,"duration":15.44},{"text":"We had intended to devote substantial time to both arguments.","start":53.363,"stop":58.82,"duration":5.46},{"text":"Now, whether on the light of a unfortunate reputation by the Solicitor General.","start":58.82,"stop":64.662,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Again, without leave of this Court and submitting an untimely brief as he did in Windward, we then be compelled to devote a little more time to the presumption argument than we had originally contemplated.","start":64.662,"stop":80.014,"duration":15.35},{"text":"Present here as distinguished from the Windward case where in Windward, the claim was by the ship, the foreign ship owner.","start":80.014,"stop":90.201,"duration":10.19},{"text":"The conduct of the unions there interfered with the ship's contract among it seamen and its internal labor relations.","start":90.201,"stop":103.708,"duration":13.51},{"text":"And for that reason, this Court determined that it fell within the parameters of the Benz doctrine that the act was not applicable.","start":103.708,"stop":113.154,"duration":9.45},{"text":"Now, we have a totally different picture here.","start":113.154,"stop":116.745,"duration":3.59},{"text":"In this instance, the association of mobile stevedoring employers brought the action in the Alabama State Court alleging almost the verbatim practical provisions of Section 8 (b) 4 of the Act that these pickets had directed their activities to the stevedore employees of the association, caused them to breach their agreements, induce them not to go to work upon this foreign vessel and claimed at that time that therefore they're entitled to an injunction.","start":116.745,"stop":161.63,"duration":44.88},{"text":"Now, when we look at both the complaint of the respondent in this case and as an additional respondent, I don't want to forget him, a farmer who has had some produce and claimed that his right to do business was interfered within so far as the Longshoremen wouldn't load his grain aboard the vessel or unload his grain to put aboard the vessel.","start":161.63,"stop":186.325,"duration":24.69},{"text":"When we look at it in the final analysis of what has happened in the factual context of this case, you have the Alabama State Court not passing upon their merits in the Windward case of the internal economy of the vessel.","start":186.325,"stop":202.672,"duration":16.35},{"text":"The foreign seamen there contract with their ship owner but on the contrary, you have the Alabama Court regulating the employer-employee relations existing between the Longshoremen American Association Employer and its employees and the American Seaman Unions.","start":202.672,"stop":226.565,"duration":23.89},{"text":"And I say in that respect that this is conduct when you examine the congressional scheme which was left exclusively to the competence of the labor board.","start":226.565,"stop":239.191,"duration":12.63},{"text":"Now, there are many illustrations of this patent of conduct, it is not unique.","start":239.191,"stop":245.466,"duration":6.28},{"text":"There are many areas where under the congressional scheme as determined by this Court and so applied where the underlying dispute, the causes of dispute, the primary dispute is without the competence of the board.","start":245.466,"stop":262.382,"duration":16.92},{"text":"Nevertheless, other aspects of the dispute remained within the sole and exclusive authority and I'd like to just comment upon appeal as I may.","start":262.382,"stop":273.637,"duration":11.25},{"text":"I think for example, the Broome, Hattiesburg case where in that instance, the Labor Board had determined on a standards of commerce that the parties in that instance did not meet the requirements, the caution for commerce and determined under those circumstances that there was no jurisdiction over the primary dispute, there was no commerce.","start":273.637,"stop":295.355,"duration":21.72},{"text":"Nevertheless, this Court held in that case that conduct complained of, the secondary conduct within the congressional scheme of regulating a conduct of American employers and American unions where within the exclusive profits of the board.","start":295.355,"stop":313.505,"duration":18.15},{"text":"And we've had three cases in maritime to that effect and Mr. Chief Justice may recall one of them, he prepared one of the arguments in the Grain Handlers case against local -- against the NLRB.","start":313.505,"stop":326.538,"duration":13.03},{"text":"The first one however comes out of the Fourth Circuit and you get the identical pattern with the Longshoremen in that case and it's the local 1438 NLRB.","start":326.538,"stop":336.319,"duration":9.78},{"text":"The Longshoremen in that particular case were picketing the vessel, claiming political reasons.","start":336.319,"stop":342.345,"duration":6.03},{"text":"The one of the issues presented there was whether or not the board under those instances because it was a foreign flagship owner had competence to process such a complaint or such a challenge and the circuit held yes and what the conduct there complained of nor the conduct the board was seeking to remedy was not the internal affair of the vessel pointing out clearly, that's what Benz inquiries and McCulloch had stood for at that posture in time, then the contrary, the relationship existing among American employers, among American unions and American workers.","start":342.345,"stop":378.19,"duration":35.84},{"text":"Now, the same context came up within the D.C. circuit and in the Seventh Circuit involving Canadian vessels, came out at the same context, one at a preliminary injunction stage and one in enforcement of the board order.","start":378.19,"stop":392.425,"duration":14.24},{"text":"And in those cases, the unions in both instances took the following position.","start":392.425,"stop":396.954,"duration":4.53},{"text":"They said “look, the underlying dispute involved here is one involving a Canadian foreign flag vessel, Canadian ship owner for -- where can I endure that distinction quite clearly between a foreign flagship and a foreign ship owner.","start":396.954,"stop":412.043,"duration":15.09},{"text":"In that instance --","start":412.043,"stop":412.801,"duration":0.76}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

the Jones Act, yes and wrote deed as you have.","start":430.407,"stop":432.77,"duration":2.36}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"That sort of the way --","start":432.77,"stop":433.379,"duration":0.61}]},{"speakerName":"Howard Schulman","textObjs":[{"text":"This Court has and also under Rededus (ph), the comments directed by Mr. Justice Harlan and that McCulloch holds that you can't have this evaluation as balancing and nevertheless, the majority -- where dealers majority apparently did not accept that and directed no comments to it and again I assume that they paid attention and disagree.","start":433.379,"stop":454.169,"duration":20.79},{"text":"Now, I think we're talking about Mr. Chief Justice, the Windward opinion talks about foreign ship owner and I assume when the Court use foreign ship owner it means just there.","start":454.169,"stop":466.78,"duration":12.61},{"text":"And it's a different issue and it's a different question that's not before this Court.","start":466.78,"stop":470.89,"duration":4.11},{"text":"And they may very well pose a different issue and on effect you got a foreign flag vessel constructively by lower American owned.","start":470.89,"stop":480.298,"duration":9.41},{"text":"And as many these major petroleum and multi national corporations exist, the Liberia where there was no question and admittedly for their own spokesman that these vessels are American owned directed by Americans under a pledge to be kept that way, constructively Americans and subject to their call and I think their concerns for relationships with respect to what I refer to you formistically as a true foreign ship owner and another, I think it differ but in all candid, I do not --this case, with that particular fact pattern is not before this Court.","start":480.298,"stop":519.356,"duration":39.06},{"text":"Now, in addition to maritime and in addition to questions of whether or not the volume of the business keeps a particular employer within the coverage of the act, there are other instances as well.","start":519.356,"stop":531.798,"duration":12.44},{"text":"Example, the railroad, this Courts decision in New York Newhaven, local 25.","start":531.798,"stop":537.664,"duration":5.87},{"text":"There, the underlying dispute involved there was not within any competence of the act.","start":537.664,"stop":546.01,"duration":8.35},{"text":"And yet this Court held as another demonstration then under those circumstances, what the complaint of, what are the party complaining up there was this secondary conduct within the competence of the Labor Board and if this was part of Congress's scheme, I think the last illustration, I'm sure there's many more, the last one that I could possibly come across is the agriculture industry.","start":546.01,"stop":567.313,"duration":21.3},{"text":"That the agricultural industry is not within the board's competence and nevertheless, there are cases and we cite the Ninth Circuit enforcing the San Francisco labor counsel but not withstanding the dispute with the farm labor, the Chavez group.","start":567.313,"stop":583.019,"duration":15.71},{"text":"Nevertheless, American union subject to the act, American employers, the Labor Board has jurisdiction, exclusive jurisdiction at least under Garmon, its arguable prohibited.","start":583.019,"stop":594.308,"duration":11.29},{"text":"Now, this is what I see and but what we see what this case is all about.","start":594.308,"stop":601.661,"duration":7.35},{"text":"The Solicitor General, the Government composes that it doesn't -- the analogy we gave where the authorities doesn't apply and cites Hanna Mining and I think I like to direct a few minutes attention to this Court's holding in Hanna Mining.","start":601.661,"stop":617.519,"duration":15.86},{"text":"Hanna Mining case was an attempt by an American officer's union to engage in picketing waters of the State of Wisconsin to compel the supervisors and compel the employer as well to make these supervisors join the unions.","start":617.519,"stop":637.922,"duration":20.4},{"text":"And the case came before this Court and to go to Wisconsin Court finding that that conduct was arguably within the can off or the exclusive jurisdiction of the board.","start":637.922,"stop":649.855,"duration":11.93},{"text":"Mr. late -- Mr. Justice Harlan made quite clear in that case that the conduct which was sought to be remedy finding no such preemption was conduct which would go unregulated which Congress in its scheme said the Labor Board should not regulate and that to come down with a result and to find that the State Court is preempted by the Labor Board would leave that conduct totally uncontrolled.","start":649.855,"stop":680.624,"duration":30.77},{"text":"And in that instance, on the -- I think that Mr. Justice Brennan held in his concurring opinion.","start":680.624,"stop":685.959,"duration":5.33},{"text":"The union there, we're just complaining incidentally there with secondary conduct but the core is a language I think Mr. Justice Harlan used the vital core of the dispute, was the attempt by the engineer's union to organize these people through economic force and that was any of the desires of their member which was not controllable at all, even under the Federal Court particularly in view of Section 8 (b) 7, and the fact that the supervisors I should say are without the structure of it.","start":685.959,"stop":716.487,"duration":30.53},{"text":"Now, that is a world's apart totally different analogy of context in any sense of arguing with this case.","start":716.487,"stop":728.006,"duration":11.52},{"text":"Here, the foreign ship owner, if he has a cause to believe as a remedy in the State Court, we can take whole of any conduct which interferes with an attempt to breech the agreements between the foreign seamen and the foreign ship owner, the articles, the contract.","start":728.006,"stop":749.291,"duration":21.29},{"text":"And when -- in Hanna Mining, the result as determined by the Wisconsin Court did not permit of that and I am directed to in substance what we are talking about is the congressional scheme, I think we all come back to that again as to what Congress had in mind as motivations in purposes this were.","start":749.291,"stop":773.276,"duration":23.98},{"text":"Congress had in mind that American employers and American unions -- American working men most significantly had certain rights, their accommodations and their adjustments.","start":773.276,"stop":786.751,"duration":13.48},{"text":"And that 8 (b) 4 encompasses all that legislative history on debate so that not only a certain conduct intended to be prohibited involving neutrals but there is also certain rights protected activity which Congress determined should be exercised by American workers.","start":786.751,"stop":812.811,"duration":26.06},{"text":"I find frankly to be subjectively quite along Solicitor General's proposal of what he calls concurrent jurisdiction.","start":812.811,"stop":824.683,"duration":11.87},{"text":"What do you say, but he's asking this Court to do, not withstanding all his legislative history is the following.","start":824.683,"stop":832.086,"duration":7.4},{"text":"He says “insofar what affects the secondary conduct as in this case.”","start":832.086,"stop":837.264,"duration":5.18},{"text":"And you look at page 29 of the appendix of the Alabama Supreme Court's injunction and they don't say a word about the foreign vessel.","start":837.264,"stop":845.86,"duration":8.6},{"text":"They just regulate my client's conduct and this employer for all vessels, American or otherwise as if this was a typical garden variety Labor Board injunction.","start":845.86,"stop":860.046,"duration":14.19},{"text":"And the Solicitor General says by concurrent jurisdiction of that regulation, of that secondary conduct should be in effect by force, not under Federal Law though, not like under Section 301 of the Act for breech of contract or Section 303 for damages for violation (Inaudible) where state courts have jurisdiction, concurrent jurisdiction but must deployed federal law, oh no.","start":860.046,"stop":888.85,"duration":28.8},{"text":"The Solicitor General opts for a situation whereas my friends on the other side get two bites of the apple, not one and maybe other people will get equivalent two bites.","start":888.85,"stop":899.513,"duration":10.66},{"text":"He says there's concurrent jurisdiction between the Labor Board under one hand to take a look into it to see whether conduct is prohibited or whether it's not violative.","start":899.513,"stop":909.645,"duration":10.13},{"text":"And on the other hand, it's a right of the party to go to state courts.","start":909.645,"stop":914.443,"duration":4.8},{"text":"I frankly find this totally at odd with the many decisions of this Court are relative to intent of the act and we're talking about secondary board of conduct and the need for uniformity and Section 10 (a) is command for exclusivity.","start":914.443,"stop":929.379,"duration":14.94},{"text":"I find other interest in fact as coming out of it, you could arrive at a situation where peoples such as the respondents here could go into a state court and get relief under state law where there's a yellow lonely guy and do some breech of contracts of other concept for which the top Court of Alabama may affirm and which there's no federal question to come before this Court.","start":929.379,"stop":955.692,"duration":26.31},{"text":"Yet another party goes before the Labor Board and the Labor Board's case comes before this Court and he get it diametrically uphold the situation.","start":955.692,"stop":965.056,"duration":9.36},{"text":"That's only some of the errors, there's more significant errors.","start":965.056,"stop":968.218,"duration":3.16},{"text":"Here, I believe 30 somewhat to coastal stage, were on water in this country.","start":968.218,"stop":972.458,"duration":4.24},{"text":"I believe they have 30 somewhat interpretations, but then they gave on the states as the impact to secondary boycotts, that would be totally violative at the Congressional intent.","start":972.458,"stop":982.205,"duration":9.75},{"text":"How do you similar problems with the Solicitor General's conduct?","start":982.205,"stop":985.636,"duration":3.43},{"text":"Norris LaGuardia was an intrical part of our labor policy which says federal courts generally are prohibited from issuing injunctions.","start":985.636,"stop":994.333,"duration":8.7},{"text":"And yet code of that 1635 and congressional legislative scheme Norris-LaGuardia is to reserve solely to the federal system certain conduct which carries with it that state courts are not to act on it and the same state court absent little Norris-LaGuardia act have no such proscription, we wind up again under this opted for policy coming out at the extreme once again.","start":994.333,"stop":1022.297,"duration":27.96},{"text":"And finally, in connection with somebody that appears to me to be similar, our stories is the question of Section 10 (a) in its expressed congressional attempt of ceding the board jurisdiction but it's got to be consistent with the act.","start":1022.297,"stop":1037.479,"duration":15.18},{"text":"There's got to be an agreement consistent with it and the law must be equally applied.","start":1037.479,"stop":1042.557,"duration":5.08},{"text":"And under the Solicitor General's contention, we totally violate each and every one of those terms and provisions.","start":1042.557,"stop":1051.018,"duration":8.46},{"text":"I think there is of course an even more significant point.","start":1051.018,"stop":1056.366,"duration":5.35},{"text":"Mr.

appeals are the same in those instances who wanted this Court to legislate the fact.","start":1064.978,"stop":1074.52,"duration":9.54},{"text":"I say this is equally of nothing more a brush attack but the Solicitor General would do that but there's something more significant which was not present in either Lorensen or in (Inaudible).","start":1074.52,"stop":1085.005,"duration":10.49},{"text":"Since this case, there has been proposed in both houses, legislation which seeks to preserve domestic employment opportunities for American seamen and that's what they we're engaged
