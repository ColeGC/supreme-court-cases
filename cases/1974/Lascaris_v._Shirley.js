Program.","start":20.575,"stop":30.717,"duration":10.14},{"text":"Broadly stated, the issue is kind of parent or caretaker relative refused to cooperate and state efforts to obtain support for a child from its father where that child is receiving AFDC benefits.","start":30.717,"stop":49.38,"duration":18.66},{"text":"And the further question is, can that parent still claim benefits as a parent or relative upon her refusal to so cooperate.","start":49.38,"stop":60.998,"duration":11.62},{"text":"The decisions of the lower courts starting with Doe against Shapiro of Connecticut Federal District Court case in 1969 have consistency held that where a mother and child had been denied assistance by states or the mother's failure to cooperate, assistance may not be terminated to the mother and child.","start":60.998,"stop":87.894,"duration":26.9},{"text":"This Court in three summary affirmances affirmed to the principle enunciated in Doe against Shapiro, that early

assistance may not be denied to the mother for her failure to cooperate in stayed efforts to establish paternity or to secure a support for her child.","start":158.771,"stop":178.177,"duration":19.41},{"text":"The result of these decisions halting state efforts to terminate the grant of the mother for her failure to cooperate has been that the state has been unable to comply with the provisions of the Social Security Act.","start":178.177,"stop":192.202,"duration":14.03},{"text":"That the intent of Congress to require such parental cooperation has been frustrated that the AFDC system has been turned upside down, putting the mother in the driver seat rather than the state agency.","start":192.202,"stop":207.337,"duration":15.13},{"text":"The people who should contribute to AFDC support thereby reducing need are not contributing.","start":207.337,"stop":215.222,"duration":7.89},{"text":"And that the ancient duty of parents to support their children has been shifted to the states and to the local Social Services Districts contrary to the provisions of the Social Security Act.","start":215.222,"stop":228.177,"duration":12.95},{"text":"Now, New York's interest in this litigation and that of its Social Services District is legitimate and substantial.","start":228.177,"stop":235.473,"duration":7.3},{"text":"The place of residence of AFDC fathers in New York State is unknown to the

State.","start":244.551,"stop":260.779,"duration":16.23},{"text":"And we submit that the state should have every opportunity to reduce what is becoming a staggering cause and has been has been staggering cause for a number of years by pursuing every avenue open to them to require these fathers to contribute to the support of their children.","start":260.779,"stop":278.889,"duration":18.11},{"text":"Now, as originally instituted, this case involved claims of the mothers that the county agency had required them to cooperate in instituting and prosecuting non-support proceedings under a state departmental regulation requiring that they furnish pertinent information in the location and prosecution of a deserting or abandoning parent, that the non-cooperative parent was ineligible for public assistance.","start":278.889,"stop":304.779,"duration":25.89},{"text":"But that the grants for her children were

3.","start":326.293,"stop":333.437,"duration":7.14},{"text":"Now, these require that a recipient of public assistance, it's not limited in its application, only to Aid to Families with Dependent Children.","start":333.437,"stop":341.46,"duration":8.02},{"text":"It's a statute of general application, but obviously in this case, we're talking about Aid to Families with Dependent Children.","start":341.46,"stop":348.866,"duration":7.41},{"text":"The statute requires that a recipient of public assistance cooperate with a Social Services official in obtaining support or support contributions from the other parent by furnishing of the Social Services official with appropriate information including the location of the other parent or spouse.","start":348.866,"stop":369.965,"duration":21.1},{"text":"By filing a petition and furnishing evidence in a proceeding for paternity and support or for nonsupport.","start":369.965,"stop":378.662,"duration":8.7},{"text":"But if the applicant fails to file the petition, nothing happens except that the Social Services official is required to do so.","start":378.662,"stop":388.624,"duration":9.96},{"text":"Then, if the applicant fails to furnish evidence necessary to support a petition for paternity and support or for nonsupport in a marital situation or if the person fails to furnish information relative to the location of the other parent, her maintenance can be discontinued for her willful failure to do so, so long as she fails to assist and cooperate as required by the statute and only so long as she fails to assist and cooperate.","start":388.624,"stop":421.763,"duration":33.14},{"text":"The children's grant continues.","start":421.763,"stop":425.224,"duration":3.46},{"text":"Now, because of the amendment to Social Services Law, Section 101-a, this Court remanded for further consideration.","start":425.224,"stop":433.279,"duration":8.06},{"text":"And after remand, the original plaintiff's below moved to reconvene the three-judge court to amend the complaint and for intervention by an unwed mother.","start":433.279,"stop":444.973,"duration":11.69},{"text":"There had been no unwed mothers in the case before that time.","start":444.973,"stop":448.853,"duration":3.88},{"text":"The three-judge court permitted intervention and amendment of the complaint.","start":448.853,"stop":453.946,"duration":5.09},{"text":"The amended complaint however, dealt only with the claim of the intervener, unwed mother who had refused to tell a Social Services official where the known father of one of her children was within a geographical area.","start":453.946,"stop":467.288,"duration":13.34},{"text":"They knew who he was.","start":467.288,"stop":468.244,"duration":0.96},{"text":"She had told them that but she just said, “I won't tell you where he is in this town in Western New York.”","start":468.244,"stop":475.97,"duration":7.73},{"text":"And the amended complaint, I have to talk about this just for a moment, did not state a claim for the original plaintiffs.","start":475.97,"stop":482.914,"duration":6.94},{"text":"And since the court had remanded, we were not frankly sure whether this Court would still consider the original plaintiffs to be viable appellees on this appeal.","start":482.914,"stop":497.832,"duration":14.92},{"text":"In any event, it appears that the intervener is an automatic appellee here and counsel is quite correctly included her in the title of his papers as an intervener appellee.","start":497.832,"stop":511.668,"duration":13.84},{"text":"But we did not amend the title of the action because the court below didn't and we -- this is a matter which we must leave entirely to the court of course.","start":511.668,"stop":522.893,"duration":11.23},{"text":"The three-judge court after the remand in its memorandum decision and order declared Section 101-a as amended of the New York Social Services Law void, unenforceable and without effect insofar as it makes recipient cooperation in a paternity or support action against an absent parent, a condition of eligibility in AFDC.","start":522.893,"stop":545.786,"duration":22.89},{"text":"And the court below enjoined the defendants in that case, the state and county officers from terminating assistance to the intervener or her minor children for failure to cooperate in obtaining support.","start":545.786,"stop":558.56,"duration":12.77},{"text":"The order on its second argument did not act upon the original plaintiffs at all.","start":558.56,"stop":565.327,"duration":6.77},{"text":"Now, if the original plaintiffs for whom those claim was stated in the amended complaint which was actually an intervener's complaint we plead, deemed by the court to still be in the case, the question presented is whether an AFDC, a parent or caretaker must assist or cooperate in a nonsupport proceeding instituted by a Social Services official.","start":565.327,"stop":587.801,"duration":22.47},{"text":"As to the intervener, the question presented is whether she may be required to furnish the location of the father of one of her children to the Social Services official.","start":587.801,"stop":598.17,"duration":10.37},{"text":"And as I say, prior to the intervention of this unwed mother, we had no paternity aspect to this case whatsoever.","start":598.17,"stop":607.023,"duration":8.85},{"text":"But as it stands before the Court now, it has both nonsupport and paternity support aspects depending upon the Court's construction of its own remand.","start":607.023,"stop":617.97,"duration":10.95},{"text":"Now, we contend that the New York statue furthers the provisions of the Social Security Act, simple as that.","start":617.97,"stop":625.792,"duration":7.82},{"text":"The appellees contend that the statute creates a condition of eligibility not provided for in the Social Security Act.","start":625.792,"stop":633.87,"duration":8.08},{"text":"And so that, we answer we don't think it does.","start":633.87,"stop":636.553,"duration":2.68},{"text":"But even if it does, the Social Security Act not only allows for state efforts to abstain support and establish paternity but require such action.","start":636.553,"stop":646.544,"duration":9.99},{"text":"And that the statute is within the legitimate sphere of state administration and is necessary to the proper administration of the AFDC program.","start":646.544,"stop":656.898,"duration":10.35},{"text":"The state statute does not violate any specific provision of the Social Security Act or rather as friendly too and furthers the provisions of the Act.","start":656.898,"stop":666.388,"duration":9.49},{"text":"This Court discussed the statutes, the provisions in the Social Security Act that are involved on this appeal and its decision in King against Smith when it was in connection of course with the Alabama Man-in-the-House-Rule.","start":666.388,"stop":684.266,"duration":17.88},{"text":"The court set out these statutes, federal statutes to which I'll allude in a moment, and said, the pattern -- this is a 392 U.S. 332, the pattern of this legislation could not be clearer.","start":684.266,"stop":698.958,"duration":14.69},{"text":"Every effort is to be made to locate and secure support payments from persons legally obligated to support a deserted child.","start":698.958,"stop":707.713,"duration":8.75},{"text":"And later on in the same page, the provision seeks to secure parental support in lieu of AFDC support for dependent children.","start":707.713,"stop":718.024,"duration":10.31},{"text":"That is exactly what New York is trying to do.","start":718.024,"stop":723.982,"duration":5.96},{"text":"New York Social Services Law, Section 101-a, 2 and 3 implements the provisions of the Section 402 (a), 17 of the Social Security
