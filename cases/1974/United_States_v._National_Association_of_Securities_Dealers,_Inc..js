dismiss the Government's complaint in a Sherman Act case.","start":68.79,"stop":80.57,"duration":11.78},{"text":"The case involves interpretation of several provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 concerning mutual funds and the relationship of that Act to the antitrust laws.","start":80.57,"stop":91.916,"duration":11.35},{"text":"In reviewing the many briefs, we found some confusion in terminology and some misapprehension of the Government's position in this case, so we've tried to address some of those problems in the reply brief we filed last week and we've also prepared this illustrative chart which I think may help clarify some of the relationships that are involved in this case.","start":91.916,"stop":114.551,"duration":22.64},{"text":"Basically, a mutual fund or an investment company is a company that invests shareholder's money in the stock of other companies.","start":114.551,"stop":124.706,"duration":10.16},{"text":"This case involves the most common type of mutual fund which is the “open end” mutual fund.","start":124.706,"stop":130.965,"duration":6.26},{"text":"Its distinctive characteristics are that share are always redeemable by the shareholder from the fund at a proportional amount of the net asset value of the funds at the time of redemption.","start":130.965,"stop":145.736,"duration":14.77},{"text":"Although they are not required to do so by law, funds most of them are continually offering shares to the public.","start":145.736,"stop":156.066,"duration":10.33},{"text":"Some however have for either short-term or long-term periods stopped offering and are closed up as they say.","start":156.066,"stop":166.231,"duration":10.16},{"text":"There are two basic types of open end mutual funds, the load funds and no load funds.","start":166.231,"stop":171.948,"duration":5.72},{"text":"The load refers to a sales charge that the purchaser pays at the time of purchase.","start":171.948,"stop":177.776,"duration":5.83},{"text":"As a practical matter, the issues here involve only the load funds and it is to those load open end mutual funds that I will be referring throughout.","start":177.776,"stop":190.691,"duration":12.91},{"text":"In the initial distribution of mutual fund shares, we have the vertical alignment shown in the center of the chart.","start":190.691,"stop":200.689,"duration":10},{"text":"The mutual fund distributes its share to a single underwriter known as the principal underwriter pursuant to an underwriting contract.","start":200.689,"stop":211.225,"duration":10.54},{"text":"Then the underwriter typically sells those shares to a large number of dealers through dealer contracts.","start":211.225,"stop":218.602,"duration":7.38},{"text":"We've only shown one in the chart for illustration but there would be many of these in the ordinary scheme.","start":218.602,"stop":226.968,"duration":8.37},{"text":"Then the contract dealer, as that dealer is known, sells the shares to the public to investors.","start":226.968,"stop":233.669,"duration":6.7},{"text":"Investor can then redeem directly from the fund or it can also redeem by going through the dealer or the underwriter, although we have not shown that path here.","start":233.669,"stop":244.087,"duration":10.42},{"text":"Now, this is called the primary distribution system in the mutual fund industry.","start":244.087,"stop":250.953,"duration":6.87},{"text":"There is also a secondary market and transactions involving mutual funds as with any other securities.","start":250.953,"stop":258.718,"duration":7.77},{"text":"Now in the ordinary securities market, the secondary market is the one of most importance to investors that is where issued shares are traded on stock exchange.","start":258.718,"stop":270.2,"duration":11.48},{"text":"A secondary market provides alternatives to the primary distribution system for an investor if wishing to buy or sell shares.","start":270.2,"stop":278.907,"duration":8.71},{"text":"Now if the investor can purchase from either a contract dealer or another dealer or from an investor either going through a broker or directly.","start":278.907,"stop":290.574,"duration":11.67},{"text":"And because of the nature of the securities business, a security's firm will be acting in various capacities depending on the transaction involved.","start":290.574,"stop":303.339,"duration":12.76},{"text":"The same firm can at different times and different transactions be a broker mean that it's acting as an agent in the purchase or sale of securities whereas a dealer meaning that it's acting as a principle for its own account and if it has a contract with respect to the shares involved, there would be a contract dealer and as to those shares for which it has no contract, it would be a non-contract dealer.N","start":303.339,"stop":329.329,"duration":25.99},{"text":"ow, although the chart here shows contract dealer, non contract dealer and broker is three separate categories, the same firm could be in all three of those categories as to different transactions.","start":329.329,"stop":342.627,"duration":13.3},{"text":"The term “broker-dealer” is used generically to refer to any firm in the security's business as either a broker or a

Dealers.","start":351.818,"stop":358.031,"duration":6.21},{"text":"That is the only association that has been registered under the Maloney Act of 1938 which amended the Securities Exchange Act.","start":358.031,"stop":367.469,"duration":9.44},{"text":"That provides a measure of industry self Government subject to the oversight of the Securities Exchange Commission under rules adopted by and reviewed by the commission covering specified subjects.","start":367.469,"stop":382.369,"duration":14.9},{"text":"None of the rules of the NASD are involved directly in this case.","start":382.369,"stop":389.3,"duration":6.93},{"text":"Now, Section 22 (d) of the Investment Company Act provides in relevant part that if a mutual fund is currently offering its shares to the public then no principal underwriter and no dealer may sell shares of that fund to any person except another dealer, underwriter or the fund, except that the public offering price described in the perspectives, I'll return to that public offering price in a moment.","start":389.3,"stop":423.143,"duration":33.84},{"text":"Also involved in this case is Section 22 (f) of the Investment Company Act which provides that no mutual fund may restrict the transferability or negotiability of its shares except in conformity with the statements made with respect thereto in its registration statement and not in contravention of any rules prescribed by the commission in the interest of the holders of all outstanding shares.","start":423.143,"stop":452.653,"duration":29.51},{"text":"22 (d) has no direct effect on the price of mutual fund shares, I'm sorry, 22 (f) has no direct effect, 22 (d) does as I'll illustrate.","start":452.653,"stop":465.514,"duration":12.86},{"text":"If the fund is currently offering its shares to the public, there's no dispute that the price to an investor charged by a dealer must be the public offering price price described in the perspectives whether that's a contract dealer or a non-contract dealer.","start":465.514,"stop":483.758,"duration":18.24},{"text":"Now that price is effectively the net asset value of the proportional amount of the net asset value of the fund plus a sales load designated by the fund.","start":483.758,"stop":498.117,"duration":14.36},{"text":"Typically, that is a maximum of 8.5% of the total amount paid.","start":498.117,"stop":505.541,"duration":7.42},{"text":"Now the price from the underwriter to the dealer is governed by the dealer contract and that is typically the public offering price less a dealer discount which for 8.5% sales load would typically be 7%.","start":505.541,"stop":522.976,"duration":17.44},{"text":"The price to the underwriter from the fund would be net asset value meaning that the underwriter gets a net of the 1.5% difference between public offering price and its price to the dealer.","start":522.976,"stop":534.337,"duration":11.36}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood

a moment.","start":646.765,"stop":662.786,"duration":16.02},{"text":"Now unlike the markets for other securities, the market for mutual funds is almost entirely this primary distribution

tiny interdealer market.","start":675.899,"stop":679.05,"duration":3.15},{"text":"There's no dealer market of sales to investors and is virtually no brokerage market.","start":679.05,"stop":688.367,"duration":9.32},{"text":"Therefore, at present the investor has as a practical matter, no choice but to buy at the public offering price and to sell at net asset value.","start":688.367,"stop":698.012,"duration":9.64},{"text":"With the development of computer technology, the potential impact or importance of a brokerage market has been somewhat enhanced and it's possible to match buy and sell orders in a brokerage transaction in a way that has not always been so.","start":698.012,"stop":715.036,"duration":17.02},{"text":"But secondary interdealer and brokerage markets have not developed because in large part they have been restrained by agreements, provisions in underwriting agreements and dealer agreements which effectively either fix the price at which such transactions must occur thereby removing any competitive incentive or preclude brokers, dealers and underwriters from engaging in them.","start":715.036,"stop":742.354,"duration":27.32},{"text":"The validity of those agreements is what is at issue in this case.","start":742.354,"stop":749.537,"duration":7.18},{"text":"Now, the

the precise relief requested in the complaint but any relief.","start":765.892,"stop":770.765,"duration":4.87},{"text":"Although there are some variations, the essence of counts II, IV, VI and VIII is that underwriters and dealers have included in their dealer contracts various restrictive provisions which either require the dealers to act as dealers in their transactions therefore subjecting

broker-dealers.","start":770.765,"stop":803.744,"duration":32.98},{"text":"Counts III, V, and VII allege that mutual funds have engaged and entered into underwriting agreements containing provisions

the development of competitive secondary inter-dealer markets and brokerage markets through a variety of means.","start":829.027,"stop":847.949,"duration":18.92},{"text":"And let me make it clear that when we talk about a secondary dealer market in the complaint and in this case, we're talking about the market between dealers, contract dealer to a non contract dealer or an investor sale to a dealer.","start":847.949,"stop":865.14,"duration":17.19},{"text":"We are not talking about a dealer's sale to an investor.","start":865.14,"stop":870.687,"duration":5.55},{"text":"Some suggested on the other side that that is the market we are trying to develop or redevelop in this case.","start":870.687,"stop":876.789,"duration":6.1},{"text":"That is not true.","start":876.789,"stop":880.804,"duration":4.01},{"text":"As the complaint was later clarified, we are not challenging in the complaint any rules adopted by the NASD.","start":880.804,"stop":890.843,"duration":10.04},{"text":"It is asserted that those rules deal only with the primary distribution system and the complaint here is directed at the secondary markets.","start":890.843,"stop":902.148,"duration":11.31},{"text":"And none of these restrictions that we are challenging is required by any rule of the commission or of any rule of the NASD.","start":902.148,"stop":911.315,"duration":9.17},{"text":"The defendants acknowledged that they have the burden of establishing some implied exception to the antitrust laws because there's no expressed exception.","start":911.315,"stop":923.705,"duration":12.39},{"text":"And they therefore must overcome the strong presumption against implied repeal of the antitrust laws.","start":923.705,"stop":930.144,"duration":6.44},{"text":"In this effort, they contend that 22 (d) was intended by Congress to eradicate secondary markets that had existed prior to 1940 and to

including secondary market transactions is covered by an implied immunity because of the exclusive jurisdiction they say of the Securities and Exchange Commission.","start":970.126,"stop":991.559,"duration":21.43},{"text":"The District Court agreed and granted their motion to dismiss.","start":991.559,"stop":996.741,"duration":5.18},{"text":"We
