Dower","textObjs":[{"text":"Please Your Honors, this matter appeared before the Court having granted a petition for writ of certiorari on the petition of David Serfass to review the record of the Third Circuit which had reversed a decision of the United States District Court for the middle district of Pennsylvania.","start":36.146,"stop":54.908,"duration":18.76},{"text":"Chief Judge Michael Sheridan had granted and ordered dismissing the indictment on motion having been filed on behalf of Mr. Serfass.","start":54.908,"stop":63.293,"duration":8.38},{"text":"He had been indicted for refusing to submit to induction under the Selective Service Act.","start":63.293,"stop":71.465,"duration":8.17},{"text":"David Serfass was in the Peace Corp in Pohnpei, a remote island in the pacific and he had completed his two years of duty there and was requested by the Panape Transportation Authority to serve several months longer to complete the training of a native as a maintenance superintendent.","start":71.465,"stop":89.486,"duration":18.02},{"text":"There was some mix up in his notifying his draft board that his term in the Peace Corps had been concluded.","start":89.486,"stop":96.415,"duration":6.93},{"text":"He did receive a notice to report for induction -- there was again another mix-up but he did make it to Allentown his residence, 2 a.m on the day that he was to report for transportation at 5 a. m.","start":96.415,"stop":111.379,"duration":14.96},{"text":"He went to the induction center in Wilks-Barre and was found to be suffering from amoebic dysentery and was returned to report at a later date.","start":111.379,"stop":122.305,"duration":10.93},{"text":"It was at that interval for the first time that he spoke to the pastor of this church and learned and in his discussions with his pastor, he began to have very serious reservations about serving in a military service.","start":122.305,"stop":137.054,"duration":14.75},{"text":"He then upon advice applied for form 150 from the Selective Service Administration which is the form to be used for an application for classification of the conscientious objector.","start":137.054,"stop":151.091,"duration":14.04},{"text":"The draft board perfunctorily denied his application and just stated to him that there was no change in classification over which he had no control and again ordered him to report for induction.","start":151.091,"stop":165.352,"duration":14.26},{"text":"This time, he again went to the induction center and the usual procedure in case of this kind at the last minute, refused to take oath and to submit to induction.","start":165.352,"stop":175.11,"duration":9.76},{"text":"About 20 months later, he was indicted and arrested and a trial date was set for speedy trial.","start":175.11,"stop":182.316,"duration":7.21},{"text":"At that time, we filed two motions, one, a motion to dismiss the indictment and also a concurrent or simultaneous motion to postpone the trial.","start":182.316,"stop":191.247,"duration":8.93},{"text":"Judge Sheridan did grant -- ordered the postponement of the trial, set a date for oral argument of the motion to dismiss.","start":191.247,"stop":198.779,"duration":7.53},{"text":"And at that argument, the United States attorney did stipulate that the application for conscientious objector classification, which David Serfass had made did meet the prima facie requirements.","start":198.779,"stop":212.303,"duration":13.52},{"text":"Following this and with a short time after the oral argument, Judge Sheridan requested and this was agreed by both parties by David Serfass and by the United States that his entire Selective Service file be submitted to Judge Sheridan and this was done.","start":212.303,"stop":227.559,"duration":15.26},{"text":"Some months later, Judge Sheridan pursuant to a line of cases in the Third Circuit did grant the motion, did order that dismissal of indictment.","start":227.559,"stop":238.622,"duration":11.06},{"text":"The Government appealed and we moved to dismiss in the Third Circuit on the ground of lack of jurisdiction and that matter as well as the argument on the merits were briefed simultaneously.","start":238.622,"stop":251.86,"duration":13.24},{"text":"The Third Circuit at that time had adopted a procedure whereby on its own order would dispense with oral argument and that was done in this case.","start":251.86,"stop":260.409,"duration":8.55},{"text":"It of course has oral arguments within this case, there was an oral argument.","start":260.409,"stop":264.74,"duration":4.33},{"text":"Now, the time interval here was interesting, this Court in its decision in Elhert had indicated that there is a no mans land between the draft board having considered a request on the merits for conscientious objector classification after notice of induction had been received, and the same kind of rather and a consideration of this issue within the military service, that the Court may very well consider that to be as a situation different from Elhert.","start":264.74,"stop":297.593,"duration":32.85},{"text":"The Musser case which was decided last summer in a per curiam opinion, I think only one dissent, Justice Douglas dissented, in a sense clarified at least for the Third Circuit, the holding in Elhert and under Musser, it was held that the draft boards had no power to consider a request for conscientious objector classification after a notice of induction had been sent.","start":297.593,"stop":321.808,"duration":24.21},{"text":"As a consequence, the Third Circuit reversed on the merits and also denied the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.","start":321.808,"stop":330.572,"duration":8.76}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

Dower","textObjs":[{"text":"No sir, he could not have made a finding of guilty.","start":361.444,"stop":364.372,"duration":2.93},{"text":"The motion to dismiss and it was accompanied by an affidavit relating to several pages from the Selective Service file, but no jury trial has ever been waived.","start":364.372,"stop":374.435,"duration":10.06},{"text":"There was no formal motion for acquittal, it's quite correct sir that we do not argue for a moment, that he could’ve been found guilty on the motion to dismiss the indictment, not having been tried.","start":374.435,"stop":394.277,"duration":19.84},{"text":"After the denial -- after the reversal of the District Court order by the Third Circuit, we then petition for a writ of certiorari and I'm quite aware that there are several other cases that we argued this morning all of which have come up at the same time.","start":394.277,"stop":408.503,"duration":14.23},{"text":"And generally deal with the 1971 Criminal Appeals Act which was an Amendment to the Act following this Court’s decision in Sisson.","start":408.503,"stop":418.806,"duration":10.3},{"text":"I think perhaps for me at least the only thing it's clear about the 1971 Amendment is that it was a response for this Court's decision in Sisson.","start":418.806,"stop":429.118,"duration":10.31},{"text":"Now, this Act is different, and so far as I know, these are the first cases to come up under this Act, now raising that question as to what the Act means at least in particularly in reference to the Double Jeopardy provision.","start":429.118,"stop":444.082,"duration":14.96},{"text":"Now, the Act I would note and I think this is quite important.","start":444.082,"stop":447.734,"duration":3.65},{"text":"Is not the bill that was introduced into the senate.","start":447.734,"stop":453.048,"duration":5.31},{"text":"The Act now provides that in a criminal case and appeal by the United States shall lie to a Court of Appeals from an order dismissing an indictment and the important words at least as far as were concerned is except that no appeal should rely with the Double Jeopardy Clause if the constitution prohibits it.","start":453.048,"stop":471.96,"duration":18.91},{"text":"Now, there were back at the point where perhaps we were in 1907 when the Senate considering the original Criminal Appeals Act had decided or had rather debated, that they're going to depend upon this Court to tell the Senate and tell us what Double Jeopardy meant, because of all the cases that have been decided particularly in the recent years and many of them under the Selective Service Act, there really is no firm guide for anyone so far as I can see to know just what Double Jeopardy means in terms of pre-trial.","start":471.96,"stop":511.043,"duration":39.08},{"text":"In some cases post-trial dismissals of an indictment or of a charge whatever it maybe called.","start":511.043,"stop":517.855,"duration":6.81},{"text":"Sisson of course was a post-trial dismissal.","start":517.855,"stop":521.84,"duration":3.99},{"text":"Serfass is a pre-trial dismissal, the second case you have today, the Jenkins case is one of which is again a post-trial dismissal -- oh, I'm sorry, it was an acquittal in the trial by a judge and the third case that you have this morning, the Wilson case, is one in which there was a dismissal of a charge after a trial.","start":521.84,"stop":545.759,"duration":23.92},{"text":"Now, in Serfass, we argue that this Act, the 1971 Criminal Appeals Act must have some meaning in order not to be a truism.","start":545.759,"stop":558.469,"duration":12.71},{"text":"I would dispose off the latter part first by saying that I cannot conceive how Congress could enact the Criminal Appeals Act which would authorize the United States to appeal in violation of the Double Jeopardy provision.","start":558.469,"stop":571.792,"duration":13.32},{"text":"Congress does have the power to regulate the jurisdiction of the courts but I cannot understand and I'm very happy that we don't have to argue or don’t have that case that an appeal would lie, which is contrary to the Double Jeopardy provision.","start":571.792,"stop":584.641,"duration":12.85},{"text":"So, if this exception is to have any meaning, then this is what I assume what these cases are about, just what is Double Jeopardy.","start":584.641,"stop":595.756,"duration":11.12},{"text":"Now, I would also point out that as I understand the real burden, the real thrust of the Government's brief in the Serfass case and to some extent in the others too.","start":595.756,"stop":609.446,"duration":13.69},{"text":"What the government is attempting to do is to have decisions of this Court which in effect would reinstate the bill as introduced into the Senate.","start":609.446,"stop":618.279,"duration":8.83},{"text":"Under which an appeal would have been possible from any pre-trial disposition of a case, short of an acquittal or a conviction of course, everyone would be appealing a conviction.","start":618.279,"stop":631.843,"duration":13.56}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, is there difference in the language in the bills make much difference Mr. Dower, isn't it clear from the bill that was enacted that Congress meant to authorize appeals in all cases unless appeal would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause?","start":631.843,"stop":648.085,"duration":16.24}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A. Dower","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't think so Sir.","start":648.085,"stop":651.527,"duration":3.44},{"text":"When Congress said that an appeal in the criminal case lies from an order dismissing an indictment, surely it must contemplate that there are situations in which a dismissal would have a reason or would have brought about -- I'm sorry, that prior to dismissal, jeopardy would have attached.","start":651.527,"stop":672.806,"duration":21.28},{"text":"Now, I think except for the Jenkins case, which is to be argued next, everybody has always talked that an acquittal was an end to a proceeding.","start":672.806,"stop":684.257,"duration":11.45},{"text":"This was far back in 1896 in the Ball case and 1904 in the Kepner case, acquittals ended.","start":684.257,"stop":693.512,"duration":9.25},{"text":"So, that what we are really talking about is at least in Serfass is a pre-trial disposition of the case in some fashion other than an acquittal.","start":693.512,"stop":703.336,"duration":9.82},{"text":"Now, what is the -- what does this Act mean?","start":703.336,"stop":711.335,"duration":8},{"text":"If it's not a truism, does it not address itself to a situation where an indictment has been dismissed short of a trial.","start":711.335,"stop":721.15,"duration":9.81},{"text":"And if jeopardy has attached in that proceeding, then Double Jeopardy Clause of the constitution would prohibit this.","start":721.15,"stop":731.073,"duration":9.92},{"text":"I am quite aware sir, Mr. Justice White that your distinction in your dissent in the Sisson case of the distinction made between technical and constitutional jeopardy and I'm quite willing to admit that the manner and which we used the word technical jeopardy in our brief is different from the way you used it and I -- further reflection I think that perhaps your distinction if I understand that would be more appropriate.","start":731.073,"stop":757.779,"duration":26.71},{"text":"But when does jeopardy attach is to a large extent the question that is involved in this case.","start":757.779,"stop":763.578,"duration":5.8},{"text":"And in fact, what is jeopardy?","start":763.578,"stop":765.735,"duration":2.16},{"text":"The Government argues that there is no jeopardy until there has been a trial, either by a jury or trial by a judge alone.","start":765.735,"stop":774.337,"duration":8.6}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.
