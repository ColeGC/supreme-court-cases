Alyeska.","start":449.763,"stop":456.8,"duration":7.04},{"text":"The award was based on what we view as a considerably expanded concept of the private attorney general doctrine which some lower courts had embraced.","start":456.8,"stop":465.636,"duration":8.84},{"text":"And although the majority conceded that Alyeska had not violated any duty, and no duties were imposed on Alyeska by the two

Lyng the Fifth Circuit which is printed as an appendix to our brief here, certiorari was then granted by this Court.","start":479.261,"stop":492.447,"duration":13.19},{"text":"Now our principal arguments in seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals decision are these.","start":492.447,"stop":499.444,"duration":7},{"text":"First, it is our position at the Fifth Circuit held in Sierra Club versus Lyng that it is not equitable to award fees against the party who violated no duty and who could not control the acts of those upon whom the duties were imposed by law.","start":499.444,"stop":518.07,"duration":18.63},{"text":"Second, the court's unwilling to rule on that basis.","start":518.07,"stop":522.216,"duration":4.15},{"text":"We contend that the Court of Appeals applied an improper concept of the private attorney general doctrine if indeed there is to be a private attorney general doctrine.","start":522.216,"stop":531.494,"duration":9.28},{"text":"Specifically it was wrong to award fees on the Mineral Leasing Act aspects of the case because that width provision on the Mineral Leasing Act was not something which reflected peculiar or unique congressional concern.","start":531.494,"stop":546.014,"duration":14.52},{"text":"And secondly, it was wrong to award fees with respect to the NEPA issues on which respondents did not prevail in the District Court, in the Court of Appeals or in the Congress.","start":546.014,"stop":558.288,"duration":12.27},{"text":"Now it's our contention that what the Court of Appeals did here is a major extension of the private attorney general doctrine that it will stimulate a greatly increased amount of litigation on the federal courts involving both environmental laws and hundreds of other federal statutory provisions, that there will be collateral litigation concerning the scope of this expanded somewhat indefinite private attorney general exception.","start":558.288,"stop":586.335,"duration":28.05},{"text":"And that so unconstrained on exception raises serious questions of legitimate concern to this Court about the proper role of the judiciary, as distinguished from the Congress in saying which federal statutes are so important that attorney's fees ought to be awarded to support their policies.","start":586.335,"stop":604.355,"duration":18.02}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Is there any case in this Court that is held that there is a general -- private

Jordan, III","textObjs":[{"text":"There is no such case, there was a reference to the private attorney general doctrine in Newman versus Piggie Park Enterprises but that was a statutory case under Title II of the Civil Rights Act and it was more -- the Court was effectively creating a presumption in favor of attorney's fees on one of the statute there.","start":612.493,"stop":632.054,"duration":19.56},{"text":"The Court noted last term in the Rich versus United States case that hadn't passed on that private attorney general concept.","start":632.054,"stop":640.435,"duration":8.38},{"text":"The Court has noted in various footnotes that other Courts have discussed such a concept.","start":640.435,"stop":648.928,"duration":8.49},{"text":"Before, I get to this principal arguments, let me put to rest a couple of matters which were raised by respondent's brief.","start":648.928,"stop":656.098,"duration":7.17},{"text":"First, respondent seem here to be trying to suggest that Alyeska was guilty in consort with the Secretary of Interior of deliberately lawless conduct and seeking special land used permits as an adjunct to a right of way under the Mineral Leasing Act.","start":656.098,"stop":671.579,"duration":15.48},{"text":"This simply cannot be supported, even the majority of the Court of Appeals conceded at the Mineral Leasing Act argument of Alyeska and the secretary was and I quote “manifestly reasonable and assumed in good faith particularly in view of a long administrative practice supporting it.”","start":671.579,"stop":690.494,"duration":18.92},{"text":"Secondly, the respondents argue that their activities support an award of attorney's fees under a kind of common benefit theory which this Court has approved in cases such as Mills versus Electric Auto-Lite and Hall versus Cole.","start":690.494,"stop":704.733,"duration":14.24},{"text":"But the Court of Appeals examined that theory too and said in effect that if you're going to apply the common benefit exception of this case, you'd have to take that exception and I quote “stretch it totally outside its basic rationale.”","start":704.733,"stop":719.025,"duration":14.29},{"text":"The Court also noted that imposing attorney's fees on Alyeska will not operate to spread the cause of litigation proportionally among the beneficiaries, the key requirement of the common benefit theory.","start":719.025,"stop":731.462,"duration":12.44},{"text":"And on this regard, the DC circuit has an agreement with the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in Sierra Club versus Lynn.","start":731.462,"stop":739.869,"duration":8.41},{"text":"Let me turn now to really our principal argument and that is the fact that Alyeska has been held to answer attorney's fees for asserted violations of the duty of the Secretary of Interior.","start":739.869,"stop":753.884,"duration":14.01},{"text":"The argument is really quite simple.","start":753.884,"stop":756.295,"duration":2.41},{"text":"First, the respondents made two arguments in the litigation earlier that the secretary lacked authority to give permits to Alyeska in connection with the right of way and secondly that the secretary did not adequately comply with his responsibilities under NEPA which requires environmental statements and public comment and circulation among federal agencies.","start":756.295,"stop":781.95,"duration":25.66},{"text":"The suit was brought only against the secretary.","start":781.95,"stop":784.751,"duration":2.8},{"text":"No claim was ever made that Alyeska violated any duty.","start":784.751,"stop":788.468,"duration":3.72},{"text":"The Court of Appeals explicitly recognized that the duties were those of the secretary.","start":788.468,"stop":793.438,"duration":4.97},{"text":"Now despite this, the Court of Appeals went on and awarded the attorney's fees against Alyeska because of its substantial participation under litigation which I cannot deny and because of the massive nature of its interests.","start":793.438,"stop":807.691,"duration":14.25},{"text":"In our view, the participation in the litigation and the massivity of Alyeska's interest is simply not the point here.","start":807.691,"stop":815.894,"duration":8.2},{"text":"The point is as the Fifth Circuit has recognized, Alyeska was innocent of any wrong doing and yet it has been held responsible with regard to attorney's fees.","start":815.894,"stop":829.67,"duration":13.78},{"text":"Let me turn now if I can to the private attorney general doctrine.","start":829.67,"stop":835.508,"duration":5.84},{"text":"That's the doctrine on which the Court of Appeals rested its decision in this case and plainly did so.","start":835.508,"stop":841.732,"duration":6.22},{"text":"Now, we contend that if there's to be a private attorney general doctrine which Mr. Justice Stewart colloquy pointed out, this Court has never really approved.","start":841.732,"stop":854.211,"duration":12.48},{"text":"It ought to be confined in some way which makes it manageable.","start":854.211,"stop":858.035,"duration":3.82},{"text":"One way to do that would be to confine it to cases involving either constitutional rights or rights which are created by statutes which implement and intend to give substantive rights under constitutional provisions.","start":858.035,"stop":872.863,"duration":14.83},{"text":"And it all further be limited to plaintiffs who

you'll find that 26 of them involve either constitutional claims or claims under implementing statutes to constitutional provisions such as 42 U.S.C., Sections 1981, 1982, 1983.","start":897.378,"stop":914.274,"duration":16.9},{"text":"Only one case involves an environmental claim that's the La Raza Unida case in California District Court

merits.","start":928.951,"stop":937.532,"duration":8.58},{"text":"And four of the plaintiffs had achieved substantially the same thing in the form of a consent

duty.","start":956.711,"stop":962.072,"duration":5.36},{"text":"Now, with respect to the sort of the important statute argument, the Mineral Leasing Act with provision of the 1920 Act simply cannot
