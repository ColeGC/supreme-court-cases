editorial judgmental discretion in the content of advertisements.","start":534.841,"stop":568.857,"duration":34.02},{"text":"And the Pittsburgh Press majority indeed promised, and I quote “that we

here.","start":728.93,"stop":742.91,"duration":13.98},{"text":"There is the correlative First Amendment right of readers of the newspapers to receive the information about the availability of lawful

residency.","start":774.57,"stop":793.111,"duration":18.54},{"text":"And I think in fact that the last reason is virtually dispositive of this case, because it seems to me unarguable that the states

activities.","start":793.111,"stop":814.478,"duration":21.37},{"text":"Didn't I correctly understand you to concede that the State of Virginia or any state could forbid members of the medical
