1972.","start":58.755,"stop":73.875,"duration":15.12},{"text":"This Court in 1971, in the case of Lemon against Kurtzman had previously declared unconstitutional a statute providing for the purchase of secular services by nonpublic schools and the Court held at that violated the Establishment Clause.","start":73.875,"stop":94.591,"duration":20.72},{"text":"Thereafter, the District Court in the East District of Pennsylvania held unconstitutional another statute and which provided for reimbursement for tuition paid by parents for their children attending nonpublic schools.","start":94.591,"stop":116.936,"duration":22.35},{"text":"Now, it declared unconstitutional as the violation of the Establishment Clause.","start":116.936,"stop":121.066,"duration":4.13},{"text":"And while that case was pending before this Court in appeal to this Court, the Pennsylvania legislature acted a package of three statutes, Acts 194, 195 and 204.","start":121.066,"stop":137.564,"duration":16.5},{"text":"Now, Act 204 can be told very briefly.","start":137.564,"stop":142.457,"duration":4.89},{"text":"It increased the amount which had originally been appropriated for the tuition grants payment although the law had already been declared unconstitutional by this District Court.","start":142.457,"stop":156.415,"duration":13.96},{"text":"However, that case is now moot, that part of our complaint is now moot because this Court affirmed the District Court, so that part of

195.","start":168.462,"stop":177.362,"duration":8.9},{"text":"Briefly, Act 194 provides for financing our tax rates funds are what are called auxiliary services in nonpublic

four of our brief.","start":189.654,"stop":206.565,"duration":16.91},{"text":"Act 195 has three separate provisions, all providing for tax support of services in nonpublic

place.","start":236.265,"stop":260.017,"duration":23.75},{"text":"The District Court, in a vote of two to one upheld the constitutionality of the auxiliary services provision.","start":260.017,"stop":274.592,"duration":14.57},{"text":"Unanimously, although Judge Higginbotham was quite reluctant, obviously reluctant to go along, but he did, for reasons which I

compromise.","start":297.029,"stop":301.809,"duration":4.78},{"text":"Part of the statute was declared unconstitutional unanimously, and part of it was declared constitutional in respect to and this Court read this into the statute to such instructional equipment which from its nature cannot be readily diverted to religious purposes and is particularly designed or designated for secular educational purposes preferred for under statute and is duly promulgated guides for the administration of such statute.","start":301.809,"stop":336.921,"duration":35.11},{"text":"Now, as far as the

them.","start":357.792,"stop":370.817,"duration":13.03},{"text":"We challenge the right to obtain these services as part of the overall program of religious education in religious school.","start":370.817,"stop":380.838,"duration":10.02},{"text":"Now we concede, we recognize that it is more convenient to bring the service to the children than to have the children come to the public schools.","start":380.838,"stop":391.172,"duration":10.33},{"text":"We are not talking about, requiring children to enroll in public schools a complete program, but to come to the public

way.","start":401.887,"stop":405.056,"duration":3.17},{"text":"But their contention that the values protected by the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment which is caught spelled out and emphasized again in Wisconsin against Yoder, and again in the Nyquist case last year that these values are so dominant in our democratic concept in hierarchy of values that the inevitable somewhat were inconvenient method of delivering these services requiring the children to come to the religious schools that they do in release time practices which this Court upheld in 1952.","start":405.056,"stop":453.44,"duration":48.38},{"text":"Now that is undoubtedly less convenient in other way, but the highest state which both the free exercise and the Establishment Clauses as the Court pointed out which is held in our heart of values requires this somewhat modest sacrifice.","start":453.44,"stop":477.497,"duration":24.06},{"text":"Now, there's another fact which we deem of vital importance and we deem maybe the heart of the case.","start":477.497,"stop":487.169,"duration":9.67},{"text":"Now this case does not come to this Court as tabula rasa which faces the nature of the educational system at Pennsylvania and the relationship of the nonpublic -- public schools and the religious schools, among the nonpublic schools with before this Court in Lemon against Kurtzman and then again in the Sloan against Lemon.","start":487.169,"stop":508.462,"duration":21.29},{"text":"It is uncontested, this was uncontested that in administering the law, we have the appendix citation page A47 or 48 the commissioner of who is -- had the obligation and force will agree that in administering the law there are certain eligibility requirements, requiring the curriculum of the school and so on.","start":508.462,"stop":535.053,"duration":26.59},{"text":"But not included in these eligibility requirements and not deemed to be disabling is the fact for example that the schools restrict admissions on the basis of religion or that the schools require all students to participate in religious instruction as condition for their continuance in the school, or that the schools serve a major religious purpose in their functions.","start":535.053,"stop":568.733,"duration":33.68},{"text":"Now, the State of Pennsylvania takes a position that these are not the stabling factors, that notwithstanding these facts, the schools and the students attending those schools are entitled to the food benefits of the act.","start":568.733,"stop":592.693,"duration":23.96},{"text":"Now, there's one constitutional provision as one which to me is as close to a categorical imperative in constitutional as we can get to.","start":592.693,"stop":609.25,"duration":16.56},{"text":"I submit that whether you look at it from the First Amendment, the Fifth, the Ninth or the Fourteenth, it is simply not within the concept of our constitutional concepts of our constitutional dictations that a service which is financed with funds raised through compulsory taxation of all citizens from such service and these citizens can be bared because of his religion and because of his race.","start":609.25,"stop":643.635,"duration":34.38},{"text":"This is as close to a categorical imperative, I can see, and only second to that is that such a school can condition participation in the benefits universally financed upon the students participating in religious services or religious sectarian instructions.","start":643.635,"stop":672.31,"duration":28.67},{"text":"This is if Your Honors please to me the heart of this case, and as I say it is close as I can see to it categorical imperative.","start":672.31,"stop":684.044,"duration":11.73},{"text":"The Court pointed that out in Norwood against Harrison in which it held that textbooks to one of the provisions of our law and one

Harrison, the Court pointed out to the dissenting or partly dissenting partly concurrent opinion of Mr. Justice White in the Lemon against Kurtzman case that if a school discriminates or restricts admissions either on race or religion or requires participation of sectarian instruction students that the services such as textbooks or other services, and the Norwood case dealt with textbooks, could not be made available in that school.","start":712.692,"stop":756.567,"duration":43.88},{"text":"So that it is our opinion, it is our view that on the basis of that alone, of that principle, the
