Strachan.","start":178.174,"stop":184.356,"duration":6.18},{"text":"In any event, that case considering the identical issue came to the conclusion that by statutory setup and these regulations implementing it, Congress had events an intention that that compensation payments were to be made voluntarily by the carrier and once payments had stopped, it is incumbent upon the claimant to file a further claim if he sought additional benefits.","start":184.356,"stop":212.479,"duration":28.12},{"text":"Now, it might seem at first forced that the filing of additional claims would be an owner's burden, however, there are numerous cases which have held that simple things such as a telephone call to a Deputy Commissioner or a claims examiner or a claimant complained that the carrier had stopped benefits and a memorandum was then placed in the file were sufficient to constitute a claim.","start":212.479,"stop":239.575,"duration":27.1},{"text":"There are cases from the benefit's review board for example which have even held that the filing of an attending physician's report is sufficient to constitute the filing of a claim so that we do not believe that the its unreasonable to require a claimant to pursue his claim with some degree of due diligence.","start":239.575,"stop":258.225,"duration":18.65},{"text":"We have cited in our petitioner for certiorari at least three other

issued, the claim is barred.","start":278.548,"stop":300.946,"duration":22.4},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed and rejected the holding and struck them.","start":300.946,"stop":307.941,"duration":6.99},{"text":"They came to the conclusion first of all that Section 22 was ambiguous and then they said it was necessary to look at the legislative history behind Section and that interpretation suggested that Section 22 was only suppose to apply when the Deputy Commissioner had issued an actual compensation order rather than a situation where a claim had been filed, had never been acted on and the time had merely run subsequent there too.","start":307.941,"stop":338.149,"duration":30.21},{"text":"We believe that the legislative history is capable of more than one interpretation and we suggest that the Court of Appeals respectfully was in error.","start":338.149,"stop":354.884,"duration":16.74},{"text":"I believe that is useful to go to the legislative history as it existed in 1927.","start":354.884,"stop":370.475,"duration":15.59},{"text":"This is found at page 16 and 17 of the Government's brief.","start":370.475,"stop":379.146,"duration":8.67},{"text":"After the Act was initially enacted, the U.S. Employees Compensation Commission which was charged with overseeing the Act complained

it.","start":379.146,"stop":402.423,"duration":23.28},{"text":"The man would get his money and the Deputy Commissioner couldn't change it even if there were some reason why he should change it and therefore, they suggested that there should be some amendments.","start":402.423,"stop":412.233,"duration":9.81},{"text":"Now, in appendix reference 33, we find and this is taken from the Court of Appeal's opinion.","start":412.233,"stop":417.712,"duration":5.48},{"text":"We find the proposed recommendations of the U.S. Employees Commission.","start":417.712,"stop":429.112,"duration":11.4},{"text":"Now, you will note that they are limiting this situation strictly to a situation where a Deputy Commissioner is reviewing a compensation order.","start":429.112,"stop":441.147,"duration":12.03},{"text":"They are not limiting it with any time framework at all so that what they have proposed in effect is the Deputy Commissioner without regard to any time limitation may review a compensation order and he may issue a new compensation order or may make a change by virtue of a compensation order.","start":441.147,"stop":462.471,"duration":21.32},{"text":"All of these of course requiring an action by the Deputy Commissioner with respect to a formal adjudicatory compensation

then go to Section 22 as it was actually enacted which would be found at page 21 of the Government's brief and I think if we compare what was done with what was proposed, we see that there are significant differences.","start":478.74,"stop":501.57,"duration":22.83},{"text":"First of all, they indicate that the Deputy Commissioner may at any time prior to one year after the date of last payment of compensation that was not in the proposal from the U.S. Compensation Commission.","start":501.57,"stop":517.198,"duration":15.63},{"text":"It also indicates that he may review a compensation case as oppose to review a compensation order.","start":517.198,"stop":525.745,"duration":8.55},{"text":"So, we feel it is very significant that what was enacted was not what was proposed and as a matter of fact, the House and the Senate reports for the 1934 amendments indicate that the eventual enactments of 1934 were as a results of meetings and compromises between the employee's Unions and the employer's ship building organizations.","start":525.745,"stop":551.649,"duration":25.9},{"text":"So that we do not have a situation where the U.S. Employees Commission makes

similar to what was proposed by the U.S. Employees Commission.","start":564.488,"stop":571.352,"duration":6.86},{"text":"Now, I also think that it is helpful to look at some of the testimony and some of the legislative history after 1934 because in 1938, we had another amendment to Section 22.","start":571.352,"stop":586.082,"duration":14.73},{"text":"Now, the problem that arose after the 34th amendment was simply this.","start":586.082,"stop":590.254,"duration":4.17},{"text":"There was no provision with regard to a situation where a Deputy Commissioner had rejected a claim for him to review it again and so amendments were proposed which were eventually enacted in 1938, which would allow a Deputy Commissioner even after he had rejected a claim within one year to review the situation to see if he had made a mistake of fact or if there had been a changed in condition.","start":590.254,"stop":613.712,"duration":23.46},{"text":"Now, on July 31st 1935 and this is House
