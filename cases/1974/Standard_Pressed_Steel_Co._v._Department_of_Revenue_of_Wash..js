final decision of the Washington Court of Appeals sustaining the assessment of the Washington Business and Occupations Acts on appellant for the privilege of engaging in wholesaling activity within the State of Washington.","start":59.928,"stop":76.363,"duration":16.44},{"text":"The Washington State Supreme Court declined review in this case.","start":76.363,"stop":81.173,"duration":4.81},{"text":"The tax is measured by unapportioned gross receipts resulting from sales or products manufactured outside of the state and sold to Washington customers.","start":81.173,"stop":93.109,"duration":11.94},{"text":"The basic questions in this cause are very simply stated to, are appellant’s activities within the State of Washington sufficient to justify the imposition of the subject tax?","start":93.109,"stop":102.096,"duration":8.99},{"text":"And two, is the tax constitutionally defective as applied to appellant and that it is measured by gross receipts derived largely from activities occurring outside of the State of Washington?","start":102.096,"stop":116.684,"duration":14.59},{"text":"Appellant is a Pennsylvania corporation with facilities located in Pennsylvania and California.","start":116.684,"stop":123.422,"duration":6.74},{"text":"The in-state activity conducted in Washington was conducted solely by appellant’s resident employee in the State of Washington who received a salary for his services, a flat fee and worked out of a portion of one room of his home and I think since the general principles in this tax scenario are rather easy to state but I believe rather difficult to apply to particular fact situations.","start":123.422,"stop":151.633,"duration":28.21},{"text":"It might be well to review the facts briefly.","start":151.633,"stop":156.021,"duration":4.39},{"text":"Mr. Martinson’s activity in the State of Washington as far as the customer is concerned brought him into context solely with Boeing qualification engineers.","start":156.021,"stop":165.809,"duration":9.79},{"text":"His primary function, was to, through this contact become aware of Boeing’s possible needs for appellant’s products and to forward this information together with Boeing specifications on that product to the out-of-state offices where if the decision were made to attempt to qualify as an approved Boeing source in this product, sample pieces would be manufactured and submitted to the Boeing qualification engineers who would conduct tests and evaluate the product and if it met Boeing’s minimum specifications, appellant would be approved as a qualified source for the product and sales negotiations and sales promotion would then ensue which could possibly lead to a sale.","start":165.809,"stop":210.712,"duration":44.9},{"text":"As reflected by the record, competing companies would also have qualified in many cases on particular parts and they would also be attempting to negotiate sales as well.","start":210.712,"stop":222.877,"duration":12.17},{"text":"Appellant’s resident employee is not involved in the sales negotiation or sales promotion at any time, rather he’s bypassed completely.","start":222.877,"stop":233.177,"duration":10.3},{"text":"All of these activities take place and occur with appellant’s employees located outside of the state in Pennsylvania and California.","start":233.177,"stop":244.287,"duration":11.11},{"text":"Mr. Martinson’s activities also and this is approximately 10% of his time, the duties I just mentioned consumed approximately 90% of his time.","start":244.287,"stop":254.759,"duration":10.47},{"text":"The remaining portion of his time was spent in what the state has characterized as a problem-solving process.","start":254.759,"stop":261.115,"duration":6.36},{"text":"In this regard, if Boeing experienced a problem in the use of one of appellant’s products, Mr. Martinson would be contacted and he in turn would forward this information to the out-of-state employees of appellant who would resolve the problem and Martinson would present the solution to the Boeing engineers.","start":261.115,"stop":282.736,"duration":21.62},{"text":"Two cases, I believe which are probably the most closely in point on this issue involve General Motors Corporation versus Washington where this Court considered the same text in Washington on different facts and Norton Company versus Department of Revenue.","start":282.736,"stop":302.078,"duration":19.34},{"text":"The decision below, the court below and the state have placed heavy reliance on the General Motors decision and I believe it represents the furthest extension of the ability of a state to tax which has been sustained by this Court as regards to an unapportioned gross receipts tax and the state has characterized the basic issue before this Court as whether or not the General Motors decision can be factually distinguished on a constitutional basis from the present case.","start":302.078,"stop":334.153,"duration":32.08},{"text":"In this regard, the General Motors decision can be distinguished in several significant respects.","start":334.153,"stop":341.881,"duration":7.73},{"text":"First and I think the most critical distinguishing factor was that General Motors maintained in Washington a very large and substantial intrastate business making sales to Washington customers on which he had voluntarily paid the Washington business and occupation tax.","start":341.881,"stop":360.631,"duration":18.75},{"text":"Additionally, General Motors made sales on interstate commerce which the Court indicated would not be subject to the tax were it not for the presence of this intrastate business.","start":360.631,"stop":372.806,"duration":12.18},{"text":"When the court held that because of the existence of the intrastate business, and because the General Motors had mingled its interstate sales with the intrastate business that the burden was on the taxpayer to show that the activities of the intrastate business were not associated with the sales on interstate commerce.","start":372.806,"stop":394.981,"duration":22.18},{"text":"And further to show that such activities were not decisive factors in establishing and maintaining the market for the interstate sales.","start":394.981,"stop":403.096,"duration":8.12},{"text":"On the case at bar, it’s an undisputed fact and it’s clear from the record that there’s no question, there is no intrastate business per se in the same terms as General Motors making sales to Washington customers in the case at bar.","start":403.096,"stop":420.993,"duration":17.9},{"text":"The General Motors decision is further distinguishable in that General Motors in channeling its interstate sales through the local outlet gained the advantages of a local business and the court held that interstate sales cannot be channeled through a local business so that the advantages of local commerce are obtained and still maintained immunity as to the sales on interstate commerce.","start":420.993,"stop":449,"duration":28.01},{"text":"In this regard, I think it should be apparent that there would be delivery in communication problems for example which a Washington customer would face in dealing with appellant that would not be present were a local business present within the State of Washington.","start":449,"stop":465.129,"duration":16.13}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Cornell, incidentally, did either California or Pennsylvania tax these gross

Cornell","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, I think that’s correct, I believe in the General Motors District of Columbia case, however, that all of the income they’re being taxed was resulted from sales to individuals within the District of Columbia and the Court urged apportionment in that case as well and that was the basis of the Court’s decision striking down the tax.","start":660.785,"stop":689.962,"duration":29.18},{"text":"I believe that the General Motors decision is further distinguishable in arriving at whether or not appellant’s activities in Washington are sufficient local incident in which they justify the tax and that the General Motors personnel, without going into detail engaged in substantial sales promotion and other kinds of activity in the State of Washington which are in sharp contrast to the activities of appellant in Washington and I believe it strains the imagination to equate the activities of our one employee with a bundle of corporate activities and maze of local connections which the Court felt were present in the General Motors decision.","start":689.962,"stop":731.896,"duration":41.93}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"This employee worked out of his own home, did he?","start":731.896,"stop":734.789,"duration":2.89}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth L.
