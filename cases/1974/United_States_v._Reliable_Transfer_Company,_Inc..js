Whalen, left Constable Hook, New Jersey in heavy winds and high seas bound for Island Park, New York with a load of fuel oil.","start":70.553,"stop":87.806,"duration":17.25},{"text":"During the course of the passage, the vessel became stranded to the west of an inoperative breakwater light, on promontory known as Rockaway Point.","start":87.806,"stop":101.689,"duration":13.88},{"text":"After a trial that lasted for several days, the District Court held that although the Coast Guard had been at fault in failing to complete repairs on the breakwater light earlier, the fault of the captain and crew of the Mary. A. Whalen, respondent's vessel, had been far more egregious.","start":101.689,"stop":120.093,"duration":18.4},{"text":"Specifically the Court found that the stranding was due 25% to the negligence of the Coast Guard, the fault of the Coast Guard, and 75%, to the negligence of the Captain and crew of the Whalen.","start":120.093,"stop":135.565,"duration":15.47},{"text":"Despite the fact that the Court found the respective faults of the parties to have been disparate, and after having observed that while a Division of Damages in proportionate to fault might be more equitable in this case, the Court nevertheless applied the divided damages rule or ordered that the damage hearing beheld in which a divided damages rule would be applied.","start":135.565,"stop":155.1,"duration":19.53},{"text":"The Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that so far as negligence was concerned, the vessel's claim that it was not at fault borders on the frivolous and with respect to remedy, that it was powerless to divide the damages other than equally, even though it recognized the force of the argument that in a case of this sort, an unequal proportional division of damages would be more equitable.","start":155.1,"stop":182.332,"duration":27.23},{"text":"Although respondent chose not to file a cross petition in this case, it nonetheless sought in its opposition to the government's petition for certiorari, and in its brief on the merits to raise an issue entirely separate from the issue of divided damages, with respect to which the government petitioned.","start":182.332,"stop":201.483,"duration":19.15},{"text":"That issue is whether the courts below correctly apportioned fault between the parties.","start":201.483,"stop":207.877,"duration":6.39},{"text":"In its brief in opposition, the thrust of the arguments made by respondent were that -- were to the effect that this case is an inappropriate vehicle for reconsideration by this Court of the divided damages rule.","start":207.877,"stop":221.697,"duration":13.82},{"text":"In its brief on the merits, the argument appears to be that the courts below, the factual findings of the courts below found by the District Court, and affirmed by the Court of Appeals were incorrect, they are seeking a de novo reweighing of those findings by this Court ultimately for a vacating of the judgment below, and a remand to the court with instructions to direct an increase in the judgment in its favor.","start":221.697,"stop":247.975,"duration":26.28},{"text":"The contention that respondent need not cross petition on an issue, such as this I think the cases of this Court relatively clearly answer.","start":247.975,"stop":260.938,"duration":12.96},{"text":"The general rule was perhaps most clearly stated I think in Lang versus Green, and the holding in that case has been approved and extended to some extent in a number of recent cases, including this Court's recent decision in ITT versus Continental Baking.","start":260.938,"stop":277.831,"duration":16.89},{"text":"I should note additionally, since there appears to be a misapprehension on this point, on the part of respondent, that the present case is very much unlike Union Oil Company versus the San Jacinto, the case which this Court took a couple of years ago, to consider the continuing vitality of the divided damages rule.","start":277.831,"stop":299.74,"duration":21.91},{"text":"In that case, petitioner both petitioned, presented the question of whether the finding a fault below was proper, and secondly, so far as the respective negligence of the parties was concerned, the dispute there involved the dispute over a question of law, and not an issue of fact which is involved in this case.","start":299.74,"stop":326.462,"duration":26.72},{"text":"Unlike the situation with which this Court was presented in the San Jacinto then, this case presents in clear and uncomplicated form, the continuing vitality of the divided damages rule.","start":326.462,"stop":338.884,"duration":12.42},{"text":"In our briefs on the merits we attempted to set out in some detail the historical antecedence of the divided damages rule.","start":338.884,"stop":345.532,"duration":6.65},{"text":"As noted there, the rule can be traced with some assurance to rules of admiralty which once prevailed in England and France, and in most other major maritime nations.","start":345.532,"stop":354.4,"duration":8.87},{"text":"Originally the rule was primarily or rather exclusively a risk sharing device.","start":354.4,"stop":362.994,"duration":8.59},{"text":"In the middle of the 16th Century however, with the development of negligence concepts, particularly in English Jurisprudence, the rationale of the rule began to undergo a continuing process of erosion, a process which I would suggest has continued to this day.","start":362.994,"stop":377.962,"duration":14.97},{"text":"By the first quarter of the 19th Century, application of the rule was restricted to cases in England, to cases of sole fault, and was expressly inapplicable, pursuant to the decision of the House of Lords in Hay versus Le Neve, inapplicable to cases of sole fault to cases of inevitable accident, and the cases of inscrutable fault.","start":377.962,"stop":401.761,"duration":23.8},{"text":"Inevitable accident, that is those cases of collisions resulting from such things as acts of God, an inscrutable fault, where fault cannot be -- precise locus of fault could not be determined.","start":401.761,"stop":415.853,"duration":14.09},{"text":"The first case decided by this Court applying the divided damages rule, that is the first case in which the issue was squarely presented for decision, was The Schooner Catharine which was decided by this Court in 1854.","start":415.853,"stop":428.621,"duration":12.77},{"text":"From the opinion in that case and subsequent cases, it's relatively clear that the rule was adapted by this Court for at least three relatively distinct reasons.","start":428.621,"stop":440.095,"duration":11.47},{"text":"First, because of the assumed difficulty of courts in apportioning damages other than equally in mutual fault collision cases.","start":440.095,"stop":447.794,"duration":7.7},{"text":"Secondly, because it was hoped that the rule would induce a greater degree of care and navigation, and finally because of this Court's [Inaudible] in applying a doctrine of bar of contributory negligence in cases of this sort.","start":447.794,"stop":463.672,"duration":15.88},{"text":"We submit that none of these considerations carries much weight today, but that the later rational is particularly instructive, that is that the divided damages rule represents an improvement over the common law bar of contributory negligence.","start":463.672,"stop":480.012,"duration":16.34},{"text":"This Court's refusal to import into admiralty law, the common law principle of contributory negligence, is a reflection of this court's inherent power often affirmed to give and withhold damages in admiralty cases upon the large principles of equity.","start":480.012,"stop":495.344,"duration":15.33},{"text":"Perhaps no where in the admiralty law has this principle been more uniformly followed than in cases involving personal injury or death.","start":495.344,"stop":505.589,"duration":10.25},{"text":"Even before this Court's decision in the Max Morris in 1890, lower courts were apportioning damages in collisions -- in accidents, subject to admiralty law, accidents involving personal injury, proportionally.","start":505.589,"stop":521.986,"duration":16.4},{"text":"The Court in The Max Morris did not specifically address that issue, or did not decide that issue, although its decision in that case speeded that development.","start":521.986,"stop":530.617,"duration":8.63},{"text":"Over time the remedy of proportional damages has become coterminous with the substantive rights of people to maintain causes of action in admiralty for personal injury and death.","start":530.617,"stop":543.155,"duration":12.54},{"text":"That development has been specifically approved by Congress of course in the Jones Act, and implemented by Congress in the Jones Act, in the Death on the High Seas Act as well as others.","start":543.155,"stop":551.529,"duration":8.37},{"text":"So, as far as property damage is concerned however, a number of commentators, notably among them, Gilmore and Black, have suggested that it is far from clear that replacing a bar of contributory negligence in mutual fault collision cases, represents an improvement over the bar of contributory negligence.","start":551.529,"stop":570.262,"duration":18.73},{"text":"The capacity of the rule to produce inequitable results is I think amply demonstrated by the facts of the present case.","start":570.262,"stop":578.185,"duration":7.92},{"text":"The Government in this case was found to have been 25% at fault, because of its failure to repair the Rockaway Point breakwater light more speedily.","start":578.185,"stop":588.385,"duration":10.2},{"text":"Yet, under the divided damages rule, it's liable for 50% of the total damages suffered in the stranding of the Whalen.","start":588.385,"stop":596.923,"duration":8.54},{"text":"Under the doctrine of contributory negligence, the Government would be immune from any liability in this case, even though it was found it would have been 25% at fault.","start":596.923,"stop":606.145,"duration":9.22},{"text":"In the first case, under the divided damages rule, the windfall is in the favor of the respondent.","start":606.145,"stop":613.163,"duration":7.02}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

the International rules, the Great Lakes rules, the Inland rules and a Western River rules, as well as three sets of pilot rules and regulations issued by the Coast Guards in state and local statutes and regulations.","start":708.148,"stop":725.88,"duration":17.73},{"text":"At pages 17 and18 of our brief, we sketch the procedures generally applicable to admiralty cases involving collisions, procedures which I think, put in some perspective the scope and the intensity of the criticism that over time has been directed at application of the divided damages rule and mutual fault collisions.","start":725.88,"stop":747.131,"duration":21.25},{"text":"As we indicated there, while the inequity of the divided damages rule is often shielded to some extent from public scrutiny, there has been an increasing and substantial amount of public criticism, particularly in recent years, concerning application of the rule.","start":747.131,"stop":763.14,"duration":16.01},{"text":"Indeed our research in this case has not turned up a single commentator, it was a proof continue application of the divided damages rule and I hasten to add that that does not mean that there are none, I simply haven't found one.","start":763.14,"stop":776.273,"duration":13.13},{"text":"Perhaps the most telling criticism of the rule, and the principle reason that the government is here today, requesting that it be abrogated in favor of the proportional fault rule, is that the United States today stands alone among the major maritime nations of the world, in applying a divided damages rule in mutual fault collision cases.","start":776.273,"stop":796.932,"duration":20.66},{"text":"This fact I think is significant for several reasons.","start":796.932,"stop":800.565,"duration":3.63},{"text":"First, it provides rather conclusive support from the view, for the view rather, that there is a readily available and workable alternative to the rule of divided damages, namely, the proportional fault rule.","start":800.565,"stop":813.598,"duration":13.03},{"text":"Second, the isolated maintenance, the divided damage rule in this country, has the inevitable affect of encouraging transoceanic forum shopping, a point which is made, I think most clearly in Gilmore and Black [Inaudible].","start":813.598,"stop":828.218,"duration":14.62},{"text":"Third, the fact that the United States alone applies a rule of divided damages, introduces in the International Maritime Commerce, a good deal of unpredictability, and I think in a necessary amount of unpredictability.","start":828.218,"stop":841.193,"duration":12.98},{"text":"This Court, we submit, has already recognized the, implicitly recognized the unfairness of the divided damages rule, at least in the most extreme case of disparate fault, by creation of a so called major-minor fault exception.","start":841.193,"stop":856.167,"duration":14.97},{"text":"The major-minor fault rule stems from this court's decision in the City of New York and the Umbria.","start":856.167,"stop":862.231,"duration":6.06},{"text":"The rule we stated in the City of New York is as follows: where fault on the part of one vessel is of itself, sufficient to account for the disaster.","start":862.231,"stop":869.9,"duration":7.67},{"text":"Any reasonable doubt with regards to the propriety of the conduct of such other vessel, should be resolved in the other vessel's favor.","start":869.9,"stop":878.517,"duration":8.62},{"text":"As noted at pages 24 and 25 of our brief, the major-minor fault rule has proven extremely difficult to apply in practice.","start":878.517,"stop":891.057,"duration":12.54},{"text":"One of the problems of the rule is that, it encourages courts to avoid a full and fair consideration of cases on its merits, in cases where the fault is obviously disparate.","start":891.057,"stop":907.882,"duration":16.82},{"text":"More importantly, I think however, is the fact that the major-minor fault rule itself involves inequity, that is, it absolves parties from fault even though, excuse me, it absolves parties from liability, from paying damages, even though found to have been at fault.","start":907.882,"stop":924.841,"duration":16.96},{"text":"The rule is I think then to that extent, but a variation of the contributorily negligence doctrine.","start":924.841,"stop":932.372,"duration":7.53}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
