subject.","start":161.986,"stop":166.006,"duration":4.02},{"text":"The defense explanation was that respondent's estranged wife had received her welfare check that morning, cashed it and given $150.00

also devoted significant attention to the question of the money.","start":201.409,"stop":208.483,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Now, the particular questioning that led to the reversal of respondent's conviction came during cross-examination of him by the prosecutor.","start":208.483,"stop":217.486,"duration":9},{"text":"The prosecutor asked him and this is at page 4 of the appendix, “Did they find some money on you?”","start":217.486,"stop":223.404,"duration":5.92},{"text":"“Yes, they did.”","start":223.404,"stop":224.831,"duration":1.43},{"text":"“Did you in anyway indicate where that money

the conviction because of it.","start":269.481,"stop":278.19,"duration":8.71},{"text":"Now on analyzing this case, there are two distinct questions which I think it's important to keep separate.","start":278.19,"stop":284.156,"duration":5.97},{"text":"The first is whether respondent's silence at the time he was arrested was so lacking in probative value, that its disclosure to the
