the whole purpose of which is to achieve emission reductions in the most cost-effective manner possible.","start":5268.101,"stop":5282.008,"duration":13.91},{"text":"And I think it's worth noting in this regard that, although we talk about the transport rule as regulating the emission of -- emissions of States, what we're really regulating is emissions of power plants within the States, and the good neighbor provision itself talks about preventing significant contribution from emissions sources or emissions activity within the States.","start":5282.008,"stop":5302.857,"duration":20.85},{"text":"And one of the things that the EPA said in the proposed rulemaking was that in some circumstances the cumulative downwind impact of

State.","start":5302.857,"stop":5323.251,"duration":20.39},{"text":"And one consequence of forbidding the EPA to consider costs is that a particular power plant in an upwind State might be required to

plants.","start":5323.251,"stop":5341.899,"duration":18.65},{"text":"And the last thing I would say is this is -- the statute, as I've said before, has prospective
