cover only a special spacing of the electrodes to achieve the desired result.","start":180.901,"stop":190.439,"duration":9.54},{"text":"And why that matters is if you think of the inventor in 1994 who

infringement.","start":214.722,"stop":234.618,"duration":19.9},{"text":"But if spaced relationship meant any spacing, then there would be infringement.","start":234.618,"stop":239.522,"duration":4.9},{"text":"So that is the exact type of zone of uncertainty that United Carbon warned against and which deters the

each interpretation it makes sense that the electrodes have to be touchable by a single hand, and they can't be touching each other or there'd simply be a single electrode.","start":298.311,"stop":309.7,"duration":11.39}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"What would be the purpose of the invention if it were only covering spacing without

it.","start":356.247,"stop":359.799,"duration":3.55},{"text":"They very well could have drafted the claim intentionally the way they did to have a broader coverage so that they cover all possible ways
