outside of a payroll period.","start":1837.92,"stop":1861.036,"duration":23.12},{"text":"And these are payments that could well have been made outside a normal payroll period, but this directs that they be treated as payments within a payroll period.","start":1861.036,"stop":1868.128,"duration":7.09},{"text":"I would again point the Court back to the historical reason why 3402(o) exists.","start":1868.128,"stop":1873.781,"duration":5.65},{"text":"It was enacted, as I discussed earlier, following a suggestion by the Treasury Department that there was a particular problem with withholding that needed to be solved.","start":1873.781,"stop":1883.966,"duration":10.18},{"text":"Now, Justice Scalia, I suppose Congress might have solved that problem in different ways, but I think what Congress did here is it simply tried to solve the problem once and for all.","start":1883.966,"stop":1894.194,"duration":10.23},{"text":"It just declared that these payments should be treated as if they were wages so that withholding would occur, thereby solving the problem that the IRS identified.","start":1894.194,"stop":1902.941,"duration":8.75},{"text":"And it enacted a definition of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits that everyone agrees is broader than the set of payments that the revenue rulings up to that point had accepted.","start":1902.941,"stop":1914.671,"duration":11.73},{"text":"And there are a couple of very good reasons Congress would have done it that way.","start":1914.671,"stop":1917.592,"duration":2.92},{"text":"One is that, because of the IRS's case-specific approach to each of its revenue rulings, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for Congress to craft statutory language that precisely captured the contours of the payments that the IRS either was treating or might later treat as non-wages.","start":1917.592,"stop":1935.052,"duration":17.46},{"text":"Second, again, the supplemental unemployment benefit plans that are evolved in the 1950s continued to evolve and take different forms.","start":1935.052,"stop":1943.051,"duration":8},{"text":"And I think the IRS just wanted to hedge against the possibility -- excuse me.","start":1943.051,"stop":1947.408,"duration":4.36},{"text":"Congress wanted to hedge against the possibility that the IRS might later decide that a plan structured slightly differently from any plan that it had considered before should also be considered nonwages.","start":1947.408,"stop":1958.747,"duration":11.34},{"text":"And there was absolutely no downside to Congress writing the definition in 3402(o)(ii)(a) more broadly than the IRS rulings had thus far had an opportunity to construe.","start":1958.747,"stop":1976.176,"duration":17.43},{"text":"That's because, again as the Federal Circuit pointed out, there is no practical harm done if you treat -- if you are instructed to treat a particular payment as wages and that payment already is wages.","start":1976.176,"stop":1991.342,"duration":15.17},{"text":"Now, Your Honor, to your point about surplusage, first of all, I don't think the canon against surplusage would help you construe FICA here because I think FICA is unambiguous.","start":1991.342,"stop":2000.543,"duration":9.2},{"text":"I do not think there is any way to read the definition, 3402(o)(2)(a).","start":2000.543,"stop":2017.146,"duration":16.6},{"text":"In any event, the only way this would be superfluous is if some court were to hold, on an issue that is not presented to the Court in this case, that the IRS has absolutely no administrative authority to craft administrative exceptions to the definition of wages for policy reasons, as it did in the revenue rulings that underlie the enactment of Section 3402(o) here.","start":2017.146,"stop":2041.307,"duration":24.16},{"text":"If a court were to reach that conclusion, then Section 3402(o) might not have any operative effect.","start":2041.307,"stop":2047.742,"duration":6.43},{"text":"But Congress in 1969 clearly could not have believed that the revenue rulings were ineffective or it never would have enacted Section 3402(o) in the first place.","start":2047.742,"stop":2057.88,"duration":10.14},{"text":"There's no other reason Congress could have thought that certain types of supplemental unemployment benefits were excepted from the definition of \"wages\".","start":2057.88,"stop":2064.954,"duration":7.07},{"text":"My friend on the other side mentioned these 1968 regulations.","start":2064.954,"stop":2069.124,"duration":4.17},{"text":"Those regulations only applied to payments from trusts.","start":2069.124,"stop":2072.779,"duration":3.66},{"text":"They didn't apply to payments, like the payments at issue in this case, that come directly from the employer.","start":2072.779,"stop":2078.012,"duration":5.23},{"text":"Those regulations did not purport to construe the definition of FICA or the income tax withholding statutes.","start":2078.012,"stop":2085.119,"duration":7.11},{"text":"And in fact, since 1957 there has been an income tax withholding regulation that specifically says that any payment on account of an employee's involuntary separation does constitute wages for withholding purposes.","start":2085.119,"stop":2097.706,"duration":12.59},{"text":"And Congress was presumably aware of that regulation.","start":2097.706,"stop":2100.674,"duration":2.97},{"text":"And again, I would just like to address one final point.","start":2100.674,"stop":2108.546,"duration":7.87},{"text":"I think opposing counsel's argument about this 1986 reenactment doesn't make a great deal of sense.","start":2108.546,"stop":2116.153,"duration":7.61},{"text":"I think the argument is that when Congress reenacted the statute in 1986 it was somehow adopting the then-current interpretation of the IRS in a 1977 revenue ruling.","start":2116.153,"stop":2126.976,"duration":10.82},{"text":"I don't think that the enactment of Section 3402(o) originally in 1969 can be taken to have left the IRS with sufficient flexibility to change its practices during the 1970s, but that the reenactment of that very same language in 1986 would be taken to freeze for all time and -- the current IRS practices and foreclose the IRS from ever modifying those practices in the future.","start":2126.976,"stop":2153.793,"duration":26.82},{"text":"Finally, Respondents point to the legislative history of 3402(o), which does contain some statements that supplemental unemployment compensation benefits aren't wages.","start":2153.793,"stop":2164.148,"duration":10.36},{"text":"I think some of the reason for that legislative history is confusion about the nomenclature.","start":2164.148,"stop":2169.007,"duration":4.86},{"text":"There were IRS used.","start":2169.007,"stop":2176.877,"duration":7.87},{"text":"I think it is clear that Congress must have been looking at the IRS revenue rulings, again because there is simply nothing else that could have possibly given the IRS the impression that any of these types of payments weren't wages to begin with.","start":2176.877,"stop":2189.513,"duration":12.64},{"text":"And I think it's very important that the Court not just look at the legislative history piecemeal, but look at the entire historical backdrop if it decides to get into any of that at all.","start":2189.513,"stop":2198.4,"duration":8.89},{"text":"But we think this case is very easily resolved on the plain text of FICA, which clearly includes these payments.","start":2198.4,"stop":2203.055,"duration":4.65},{"text":"We don't even think there is a need to look at Section 3402(o), which is limited in effect to the income tax withholding provisions and was enacted to solve a specific income tax withholding-related problem and not to affect FICA's basic definition of wages.","start":2203.055,"stop":2218.329,"duration":15.27}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"How about that we should just ignore their revenue rulings, including the current
