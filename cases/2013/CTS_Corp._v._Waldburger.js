it.","start":95.128,"stop":106.516,"duration":11.39},{"text":"The result of that would be to totally defeat what Congress meant to do, and say the trigger is when you know the cause of the

think Congress's purpose here was slightly narrower than saving all long-latent injury claims.","start":132.151,"stop":138.055,"duration":5.9},{"text":"I think what Congress was worried about was expedition and making sure that it didn't force people to come to court before -- under a statute of limitations before they would be expected to.","start":138.055,"stop":148.01,"duration":9.95},{"text":"And that's set out -- the statute itself accomplishes only one thing, Section (a)(1), and I'm reading from page 1 of our opening brief to the Court.","start":148.01,"stop":155.266,"duration":7.26},{"text":"\"It does one thing only, which is if the applicable limitations period for one of these actions as specified in a State law statute

injury.","start":222.744,"stop":230.247,"duration":7.5},{"text":"And if here, the statute of repose is preventing that, why would Congress have wanted to modify a statute of limitations but not get

willing to go as far as the one study group recommendation and change statutes of limitations, a procedural mechanism, it wasn't willing to go right into the heart of the elements of the cause of

out.","start":277.378,"stop":280.597,"duration":3.22},{"text":"And so Congress was very careful to tread lightly here and preserve the prerogatives of the States to keep in place the statute

of limitations, of course, as this statute reflects, are designed -- they're about diligence.","start":347.058,"stop":352.295,"duration":5.24},{"text":"They're about making sure that people don't sleep on their rights.","start":352.295,"stop":354.828,"duration":2.53},{"text":"And so what Congress did here was it left in place State law as it found it, including the limitations period, the time

date.","start":354.828,"stop":372.357,"duration":17.53}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Suppose -- suppose a State has -- most of these statutes of repose are piggybacked on top
