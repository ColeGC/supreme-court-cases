Lee","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:","start":12.991,"stop":17.959,"duration":4.97},{"text":"This lawsuit was brought as a class action by parents of black students attending desegregating public publics in seven states and seeking to represent a nationwide class of several million parents similarly situated.","start":17.959,"stop":33.386,"duration":15.43},{"text":"The relief that they seek is not desegregation of a public school nor admission of any child to any school, public or private.","start":33.386,"stop":42.408,"duration":9.02},{"text":"Rather, they seek an order that the Internal Revenue Service change its standards for determining the tax exempt status of private schools which their children neither attend nor seek to attend located in or serving desegregating public school districts.","start":42.408,"stop":60.12,"duration":17.71},{"text":"The Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action.","start":60.12,"stop":63.924,"duration":3.8},{"text":"They lack standing for two separate reasons, each of which is independently dispositive and each of which is squarely based on a holding by this Court.","start":63.924,"stop":76.064,"duration":12.14},{"text":"I will discuss each of those two holdings separately, and the first is Valley Forge Christian College versus Americans United for Separation of Church and State.","start":76.064,"stop":85.103,"duration":9.04},{"text":"Valley Forge makes clear that without exception, even in establishment clause cases, there is no standing to sue for the purpose of assuring that the Federal Government faithfully observe a particular plaintiff's view of the requirements of a particular provision of the Constitution.","start":85.103,"stop":109.286,"duration":24.18},{"text":"The constitutionally irreduceable minimum requirement of injury in fact must be an injury that is more narrow in scope than breach of the interest shared by all citizens in assuring that Government steer clear of any particular kind of governmental conduct, such as giving financial aid to a church or to a discriminating school or violates the ineligibility clause or the accounts clause or the incompatibility clause.","start":109.286,"stop":142.19,"duration":32.9},{"text":"If any exception to that general principle, which reaches all the way back for 60 years to Frothingham versus Mellon, were to be acknowledged, the strongest possible case for an exception existed in Valley Forge itself, because, as stressed by the dissents in that case, one of the central functions of the establishment clause is to prevent precisely what the plaintiffs were alleging in Valley Forge, namely direct governmental aid to religion.","start":142.19,"stop":172.395,"duration":30.21},{"text":"The Court very correctly ruled that there is no exception, even for establishment clause cases, and thereby established that Article III has independent constitutional significance of its own and the standing issue is to be considered prior to and independent of any other constitutional issue whose substance the plaintiffs seek to vindicate.","start":172.395,"stop":197.193,"duration":24.8},{"text":"The other case whose holding also squarely controls, though for quite different reasons, is Simon versus Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, whose facts are remarkably similar to the facts of this case.","start":197.193,"stop":210.853,"duration":13.66},{"text":"Simon held that indigent persons and organizations lack standing to challenge the tax exempt status of hospitals which refused fully to service the indigent, and the reason that they lacked standing was because one could only speculate whether the relief that they sought, namely the revocation of the exemptions, would in fact cure the injury on which their standing was based, namely the unavailability of hospital services.","start":210.853,"stop":241.955,"duration":31.1},{"text":"The identical defect exists in this case, as even the Court of Appeals recognized.","start":241.955,"stop":248.459,"duration":6.5},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, however, distinguished Simon from this case on the ground that school desegregation cases in that court's view call for a different, more relaxed set of standing requirements.","start":248.459,"stop":264.321,"duration":15.86},{"text":"The court concluded that three of this Court's desegregation decisions, Norwood, Gilmore and Green, were in tension with Simon and that the court was therefore forced to select from two divergent lines of Supreme Court decisions.","start":264.321,"stop":277.629,"duration":13.31},{"text":"In fact, I submit there is no divergence at all and Simon squarely governs for two reasons.","start":277.629,"stop":284.651,"duration":7.02},{"text":"The first is that the notion that for purposes of determining standing there is any difference between school desegregation cases on the one hand and hospital discrimination cases on the other, that the weight of the Article III burden somehow shifts, diminishes or increases according to the nature or importance of the substantive claim was squarely rejected by this Court and expressly rejected by this Court in Valley Forge, which came down after the Court of Appeals' decision in this case.","start":284.651,"stop":317.456,"duration":32.81},{"text":"Second, even considered in isolation, the decisions in Norwood, Gilmore and Green do not establish any doctrinal enclave for standing a desegregation cases.","start":317.456,"stop":327.578,"duration":10.12},{"text":"Indeed, in our view they establish very few standing principles at all because, as Judge Tamm pointed out in dissent, they were not standing cases.","start":327.578,"stop":337.334,"duration":9.76},{"text":"The defendants in Norwood and Gilmore were the State of Mississippi and the City of Montgomery, the precise governmental bodies that had discriminated against these claimants in prior precise desegregation suits because of the race of those plaintiffs, Norwood, Gilmore, and their colleagues.","start":337.334,"stop":360.699,"duration":23.37},{"text":"Having in both cases been parties to specific desegregation decrees, the plaintiffs in Norwood and Gilmore brought suit directly against those who had discriminated against them and, as the Court observed in Gilmore, the relief that they sought was directly related to the concrete injury they suffered.","start":360.699,"stop":380.196,"duration":19.5},{"text":"Here, by contrast, the suit is against the revenue collector and not against the discriminator.","start":380.196,"stop":386.934,"duration":6.74},{"text":"With regard to the summary affirmance in Green, the standing issue was not squarely presented.","start":386.934,"stop":392.671,"duration":5.74},{"text":"This Court's ruling was only a summary affirmance, and this Court later observed that because the Government and the plaintiffs in that case were in agreement, the Court's affirmance in Green lacks the precedential weight of a case involving a truly adversary controversy.","start":392.671,"stop":408.649,"duration":15.98}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I suppose, however, the Court had to assume standing existed to have entered the order it did.","start":408.649,"stop":415.453,"duration":6.8},{"text":"So it's much harder to explain, I think.","start":415.453,"stop":418.655,"duration":3.2}]},{"speakerName":"Rex E. Lee","textObjs":[{"text":"It is correct, Justice O'Connor, that any court necessarily holds that there is standing in any decision where it renders a substantive decision on the merits.","start":418.655,"stop":431.046,"duration":12.39},{"text":"However, even if you get over the Valley Forge hurdle, which I submit you can't in this instance, which came down after the Court of Appeals' decision, so that you have to weigh the persuasive merits of a Green decision on the one hand and a Simon on the other, which came down after Green, certainly for reasons set forth in this Court's first Bob Jones decision the Green decision is of less persuasive merit.","start":431.046,"stop":456.113,"duration":25.07}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"As long as you're interrupted, may I ask you another question.","start":456.113,"stop":459.815,"duration":3.7},{"text":"The plaintiffs below alleged that the Internal Revenue Service had violated with the tax exemption practice several specific sections or at least one section of the Revenue Code, and a violation of Title VI was alleged, and a violation of Section 1981 and I guess the Fifth Amendment itself.","start":459.815,"stop":486.132,"duration":26.32},{"text":"Now, in your view is it unlawful for the Internal Revenue Service under any of those sections or provisions to follow the policy it did on the tax exemption if the Internal Revenue Service does not know that the school is discriminating racially?","start":486.132,"stop":513.783,"duration":27.65},{"text":"Is knowledge an element?","start":513.783,"stop":516.669,"duration":2.89}]},{"speakerName":"Rex E. Lee","textObjs":[{"text":"Under the present procedure that is followed by the Internal Revenue Service, and a perfectly acceptable procedure, knowledge is gained by the devices that are available to the Internal Revenue Service, and certainly they cannot revoke the tax exemptions of any entity whom they do not know to be discriminating.","start":516.669,"stop":541.1,"duration":24.43},{"text":"But they do the best job that they can of finding out who those discriminators are and then revoking their tax exemptions.","start":541.1,"stop":547.706,"duration":6.61},{"text":"If there are 1981 violations, then there should be 1981 suits brought against the discriminators.","start":547.706,"stop":555.794,"duration":8.09},{"text":"If there are Title VI violations, then Title VI suits should be brought against the discriminators.","start":555.794,"stop":562.049,"duration":6.25},{"text":"But it is an entirely different issue for the competitors or the adversaries in 1981 suit on a Title VI suit to go beyond bringing the direct suit to cure the particular injury in fact that they had and seek to employ the machinery of the Internal Revenue Service to impose a heavier burden on their adversary or their competitor.","start":562.049,"stop":593.234,"duration":31.19}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Solicitor General...
