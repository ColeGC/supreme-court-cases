Court:","start":13.574,"stop":18.181,"duration":4.61},{"text":"On the 7th day of November of 1981, Denver Detective Sergeant Don DeNovellis obtained information from a confidential informant.","start":18.181,"stop":28.989,"duration":10.81},{"text":"The informant told Detective DeNovellis that a person known as Antonio Guadalupe Nunez had been seen by the informant within the last 24 hours preparing heroin for sale.","start":28.989,"stop":44.295,"duration":15.31},{"text":"He was diluting the heroin and putting it into balloons, a common mode of packaging for sale.","start":44.295,"stop":50.761,"duration":6.47},{"text":"The informant told Detective DeNovellis that Mr. Nunez said that he had recently been to Mexico and in Mexico he had purchased five ounces of heroin.","start":50.761,"stop":61.586,"duration":10.82},{"text":"Detective DeNovellis then obtained a search warrant based upon this information and, along with Adams County Sheriff's officers, went to Mr. Nunez's home in Adams County, Colorado.","start":61.586,"stop":74.658,"duration":13.07},{"text":"They entered the home and searched Mr. Nunez and from his pocket they took 15 balloons which contained heroin.","start":74.658,"stop":82.562,"duration":7.9},{"text":"Mr. Nunez was charged with possession of a Schedule One Controlled Substance in Colorado and his counsel filed a motion to suppress the fruits of that search, alleging in part there was no probable cause for that search.","start":82.562,"stop":98.18,"duration":15.62},{"text":"He also filed a motion for the disclosure of this particular confidential informant who provided this information.","start":98.18,"stop":104.692,"duration":6.51},{"text":"A hearing was held in September of 1982 upon that motion for disclosure.","start":104.692,"stop":111.034,"duration":6.34},{"text":"At that time, Mr. Nunez himself testified.","start":111.034,"stop":115.922,"duration":4.89},{"text":"He stated among other things that he was off in the mountains hunting in his motor home, that he had to been to Mexico, and that the only people who had been at his home within 24 hours of the 7th day of November of 1981 were members of his immediate and extended family.","start":115.922,"stop":133.759,"duration":17.84},{"text":"He also said at one point during cross examination that he did not know what heroin was.","start":133.759,"stop":140.226,"duration":6.47},{"text":"The court, based upon this information, ordered the prosecution to disclose the name of the

reasons:","start":155.828,"stop":159.343,"duration":3.51},{"text":"The court in the case of Colorado versus Nunez relied upon three prior Colorado decisions.","start":159.343,"stop":166.293,"duration":6.95},{"text":"The first decision was People versus Dailey which had been decided approximately one and a half years before.","start":166.293,"stop":174.072,"duration":7.78},{"text":"In People versus Dailey, the Colorado Supreme Court referred at one point to the Colorado Constitution, but at that time it was only for the amount of information necessary to begin a veracity hearing.","start":174.072,"stop":187.44,"duration":13.37}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, on that point, I think Dailey states that in Colorado the rule is that a defendant is entitled to a veracity hearing once he shows a good faith basis for believing the material in the affidavit was inaccurate.","start":187.44,"stop":201.887,"duration":14.45},{"text":"Now, do you think that that holding is based on federal law?","start":201.887,"stop":205.886,"duration":4}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Leon Bernard","textObjs":[{"text":"Your Honor, I would like to say so, but I don't believe that I can, because there is an

not.","start":211.088,"stop":212.853,"duration":1.77}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Leon Bernard","textObjs":[{"text":"--There is an indication clearly that it was based upon the Colorado Constitution.","start":212.853,"stop":215.648,"duration":2.79},{"text":"But, the issue in this case concerns the disclosure of the informant.","start":215.648,"stop":219.975,"duration":4.33},{"text":"The Colorado court in Dailey--","start":219.975,"stop":221.24,"duration":1.27}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day

Bernard","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":234.219,"stop":234.734,"duration":0.52},{"text":"Justice Lohr said exactly that.","start":234.734,"stop":236.905,"duration":2.17},{"text":"They have adopted the same test of Roviaro versus McCray.","start":236.905,"stop":240.294,"duration":3.39},{"text":"If I may elaborate on my answer a little bit, in the Dailey opinion, the Colorado Supreme Court said specifically that while the Colorado Constitution may support a lesser amount of evidence shown, when it talked about what consequences, and disclosure is one of the consequences, that must flow from the decision the court must make after that showing, it referred specifically to both the United States Constitution and to the Colorado Constitution.","start":240.294,"stop":272.843,"duration":32.55},{"text":"At that hearing... After that hearing and after the order of disclosure, the prosecution took an interlocutory appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Colorado in which that issue was addressed.","start":272.843,"stop":288.071,"duration":15.23},{"text":"The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision and we petitioned for certiorari.","start":288.071,"stop":294.648,"duration":6.58},{"text":"This Court granted review.","start":294.648,"stop":296.382,"duration":1.73},{"text":"The issue in this case is essentially twofold.","start":296.382,"stop":302.192,"duration":5.81}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"Excuse me.","start":302.192,"stop":303.268,"duration":1.08},{"text":"In Colorado is

Justice Marshall.","start":308.922,"stop":310.297,"duration":1.38}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"And, you didn't ask for it?","start":310.297,"stop":311.437,"duration":1.14}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Leon Bernard","textObjs":[{"text":"No, we did not.","start":311.437,"stop":312.468,"duration":1.03}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"Why?","start":312.468,"stop":313.281,"duration":0.81}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Leon

first issue in this case is an issue that was reserved in Franks versus Delaware.","start":319.294,"stop":330.243,"duration":10.95},{"text":"In that opinion at page 170, Justice Blackmun reserved the issue, a difficult issue, of whether an informant should be disclosed after a satisfactory showing at a veracity hearing.","start":330.243,"stop":342.425,"duration":12.18},{"text":"The issue in this case also concerns where, as in the case at bar, if the counsel for the accused and the court both concede that the credibility of the police officer of Frank is not at issue, therefore, should there be disclosure at all?","start":342.425,"stop":362.198,"duration":19.77},{"text":"Before we get--","start":362.198,"stop":363.151,"duration":0.95}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day

point?","start":363.151,"stop":373.162,"duration":10.01}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Leon Bernard","textObjs":[{"text":"--Your Honor, I believe that this goes to a question of Fourth Amendment interpretation and the exclusionary rule.","start":373.162,"stop":379.957,"duration":6.8},{"text":"First of all, beginning with Aguilar and Spinelli and with this Court's recent decision in Illinois versus Gates, there is clearly an issue of whether a confidential informant can be used in a search warrant.","start":379.957,"stop":393.515,"duration":13.56},{"text":"When that happens, that becomes a Fourth Amendment issue.","start":393.515,"stop":396.905,"duration":3.39},{"text":"This is not merely a question of evidentiary law, but this is a question of the application of the Fourth Amendment.","start":396.905,"stop":404.353,"duration":7.45},{"text":"The question is, therefore, does the Fourth Amendment require disclosure if, after a veracity hearing, there is a certain showing.","start":404.353,"stop":413.693,"duration":9.34}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you think the Fourth Amendment forbids the disclosure of an informant's name?","start":413.693,"stop":419.645,"duration":5.95}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Leon Bernard","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":419.645,"stop":420.035,"duration":0.39},{"text":"We submit that the Fourth Amendment does that.","start":420.035,"stop":422.768,"duration":2.73},{"text":"And, we submit, even assuming in certain situations that the Fourth Amendment does permit disclosure of an informant's name after an appropriate showing at a veracity hearing in our case, that should not be because the whole purpose of a veracity hearing is to question whether the state itself has erred in any way, whether there has been police misconduct, if the affiant's credibility is not at issue.","start":422.768,"stop":450.195,"duration":27.43},{"text":"In other words, if the affiant in good faith relied upon what he was told by his informant, then there is no purpose, no application, no deterrant result for the exclusionary rule.","start":450.195,"stop":461.002,"duration":10.81}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"How will you get to the veracity if you don't admit who the person is, if you don't

truth.","start":487.18,"stop":494.661,"duration":7.48},{"text":"I think this Court has recognized what their use is in the past.","start":494.661,"stop":498.096,"duration":3.44},{"text":"The issue at

Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"What else can you do?","start":536.691,"stop":537.535,"duration":0.84}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Leon Bernard","textObjs":[{"text":"--There are alternative forms of information.","start":537.535,"stop":540.69,"duration":3.16},{"text":"For example, as in this case, information from the accused himself, information from other people whom the accused may bring into the court who have information to give to the court on this issue.","start":540.69,"stop":550.842,"duration":10.15},{"text":"Hypothetically, if the assertion had been that I had not been at my home when that person said I was there, and the defendant could bring in people who could say, yes, he was not at his home, he was with me.","start":550.842,"stop":558.902,"duration":8.06},{"text":"That would be an alternative form of establishing that information.","start":558.902,"stop":559.152,"duration":0.25},{"text":"So, I submit there are at least two alternatives.","start":559.152,"stop":560.011,"duration":0.86},{"text":"One is questioning the affiant and one is permitting the defense himself to bring in information to attack the credibility of the affiant.","start":560.011,"stop":565.291,"duration":5.28}]},{"speakerName":"Thurgood Marshall","textObjs":[{"text":"But, why can't you have the in camera

hearing?","start":578.175,"stop":581.876,"duration":3.7}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Leon Bernard","textObjs":[{"text":"Because an in camera hearing, we feel, has certain threats.","start":581.876,"stop":585.048,"duration":3.17},{"text":"One threat is this.","start":585.048,"stop":586.984,"duration":1.94},{"text":"If an informant knows that he is going to be brought

officer may lie.","start":619.986,"stop":623.297,"duration":3.31},{"text":"But, I don't think that the presumption is either that police officers or informants lie.","start":623.297,"stop":627.687,"duration":4.39},{"text":"I think that the privilege itself was established to permit a flow of information.","start":627.687,"stop":633.623,"duration":5.94},{"text":"And, I think in McCray versus Illinois Justice Weintraub foresaw exactly the problem that we see in this case.","start":633.623,"stop":643.118,"duration":9.5},{"text":"In the quote that I have cited in my brief, Justice Weintraub says that if a defendant knows that he can submit to the court any evidence at all, the court itself is going to order disclosure because they have no ability to impeach.","start":643.118,"stop":661.954,"duration":18.84},{"text":"At that point, the informant will always be disclosed and the whole chain of information will be broken, the flow of information will be dried up.","start":661.954,"stop":672.075,"duration":10.12},{"text":"If at a veracity hearing the purpose is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused has committed a crime and probable cause to believe that at his residence are the fruits of that crime, then in this case the disclosure of the informant is an ancillary part of that.","start":672.075,"stop":699.47,"duration":27.39},{"text":"It is part of the probable cause determination.","start":699.47,"stop":701.859,"duration":2.39},{"text":"Since Aguilar and Spinelli and Gates made rules under our Constitution to govern the use of confidential informants and warrants the decision whether to disclose them becomes a Fourth Amendment consideration here.","start":701.859,"stop":716.603,"duration":14.74},{"text":"As I said to Justice O'Connor earlier, it is not a question of evidentiary law, state evidentiary law, it is part and parcel of the Franks versus Delaware analysis and it is part and parcel of the issue that this Court reserved in that case.","start":716.603,"stop":731.973,"duration":15.37},{"text":"There is an issue as to whether there was an independent and adequate state grounds for this decision which Justice O'Connor raised.","start":731.973,"stop":743.202,"duration":11.23},{"text":"The tests that this Court has established in a series of cases, Delaware versus Prouse, South Dakota versus Neville, culminating with Michigan versus Long, which was decided in July of 1983, I believe, indicates that this Court presumes that there is not an independent and adequate state grounds if there is not a clear and express showing on the face of the opinion.","start":743.202,"stop":771.691,"duration":28.49},{"text":"In this case, as far as the issue of disclosure is concerned, there was no clear and independent showing

law.","start":782.061,"stop":792.635,"duration":10.57},{"text":"Based upon that presumption, I submit that this Court does and should take jurisdiction.","start":792.635,"stop":798.82,"duration":6.19},{"text":"In the Colorado Supreme Court's decision in the Nunez case...
