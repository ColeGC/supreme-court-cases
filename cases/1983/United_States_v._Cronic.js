cases.","start":1373.693,"stop":1392.122,"duration":18.43},{"text":"Secondly, the nature of the inquiry is in some respects as perversion of the adversary process.","start":1392.122,"stop":1398.73,"duration":6.61},{"text":"A hearing such as that required to determine why the lawyer did what when has the effect of putting the lawyer in the awkward

the position of defending his former adversary's actions, to say that they were reasonable and effective.","start":1413.099,"stop":1423.204,"duration":10.11},{"text":"Third, it's often a highly subjective inquiry, because it requires predictions about the state of the law, what the attorney perceived in the case at the time.","start":1423.204,"stop":1436.558,"duration":13.35},{"text":"Fourth, it undermines the independence of defense counsel, independence that this Court held just two terms ago in Polk County is constitutionally mandated; that once the lawyer is freed of the external restraints that Justice O'Connor referred to, that is effectively the assistance of counsel to which the Sixth Amendment refers.","start":1436.558,"stop":1458.988,"duration":22.43},{"text":"But under a rule that did not require a substantial showing, the result could be to have courts and prosecutors oversee defense counsel's actions at trial in order to prevent the conviction from later being set aside.","start":1458.988,"stop":1474.792,"duration":15.8},{"text":"And also, under our adversary system, the heart of it, the premise of it, is that the attorney, either retained or appointed, who assumes responsibility in a criminal case, is, as the Court said in Polk County, performing an essentially private function, and the integrity of the adversary process depends on the presumption that the attorney will perceive his duties and will conscientiously perform them according to his ethical responsibilities.","start":1474.792,"stop":1503.905,"duration":29.11},{"text":"So the Court should give effect to that presumption.","start":1503.905,"stop":1508.075,"duration":4.17},{"text":"And last, to have too quick an inquiry into counsel's actual performance would detract from the trial itself, because our adversary system attaches finality to a judgment of conviction and it presupposes that a trial of the Defendant himself will not automatically be followed by a trial of the attorney, as Justice Brennan observed in his dissenting opinion in Wainright versus Sykes.","start":1508.075,"stop":1534.581,"duration":26.51},{"text":"Therefore, we believe a substantial showing should be made before these sorts of inquiries are made, and in our view the appropriate objective criterion for this is whether there is a substantial defect in the proceedings that resulted from counsel's action.","start":1534.581,"stop":1553.042,"duration":18.46},{"text":"This is an

Court.","start":1553.042,"stop":1563.772,"duration":10.73},{"text":"It must be remembered that a party in litigation cannot ordinarily get a valid judgment set aside by saying his attorney made a mistake.","start":1563.772,"stop":1572.128,"duration":8.36},{"text":"The usual relief that a client has in those circumstances is against his attorney for malpractice, not to set aside a conviction and impose the burdens on his opponent.","start":1572.128,"stop":1584.654,"duration":12.53},{"text":"And we suggest... and in that malpractice action, the client would have to show more than that the lawyer didn't perform reasonably; he'd have to show that there was some prejudice as a result and in fact, under malpractice law, that the client would have prevailed.","start":1584.654,"stop":1600.039,"duration":15.38},{"text":"We suggest that a similar showing of prejudice is appropriate where what the lawyer seeks is to... or what the Defendant seeks is to have his conviction set aside.","start":1600.039,"stop":1614.064,"duration":14.03},{"text":"This follows also from the text of the Sixth Amendment and the decision in Gideon.","start":1614.064,"stop":1620.515,"duration":6.45},{"text":"The text of the Sixth Amendment refers to the assistance of counsel.","start":1620.515,"stop":1623.905,"duration":3.39},{"text":"If counsel is denied or effectively denied, as in Powell, then a conviction is set aside.","start":1623.905,"stop":1631.557,"duration":7.65},{"text":"But where the claim is that the lawyer committed specific errors, it's our submission that those errors must be of comparable severity, comparable seriousness or gravity to an outright denial of counsel in order for relief to be granted.","start":1631.557,"stop":1648.27,"duration":16.71},{"text":"And because the purpose of the Sixth Amendment, as stated in Gideon and other cases, is to guarantee the fairness of the

proceedings.","start":1648.27,"stop":1668.261,"duration":19.99},{"text":"This is reflected in this Court's decision in McMann versus Richardson 13 years ago, which addresses this area, in which the

unfair.","start":1688.159,"stop":1694.345,"duration":6.19},{"text":"It also directly corresponds to this Court's decision in Agurs, where the Court said that the purpose of the inquiry is not to find
