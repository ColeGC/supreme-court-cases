Court:","start":7.57,"stop":11.974,"duration":4.4},{"text":"This case raises the question of what elements the government must prove in order to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001, the federal false statements statute.","start":11.974,"stop":25.281,"duration":13.31},{"text":"Respondent in this case filled out a form in connection with a security clearance process required by the Department of Defense.","start":25.281,"stop":33.637,"duration":8.36},{"text":"Respondent had been hired as an engineer by a company that was a defense contractor.","start":33.637,"stop":39.375,"duration":5.74},{"text":"In order to work on certain projects, it was necessary that he be investigated and that he receive a government security clearance.","start":39.375,"stop":47.564,"duration":8.19},{"text":"For that purpose, Respondent's employer gave him a work sheet to fill out.","start":47.564,"stop":52.866,"duration":5.3},{"text":"On that work sheet, Respondent indicated that he had never been convicted of a crime and he listed the employers for whom he had worked in the past.","start":52.866,"stop":61.99,"duration":9.12},{"text":"Respondent's employer transcribed that information onto another form entitled","start":61.99,"stop":68.31,"duration":6.32},{"text":"\"Department of Defense personnel security questionnaire. \"","start":68.31,"stop":71.779,"duration":3.47},{"text":"Respondent signed that form and it was mailed to the Department of Defense.","start":71.779,"stop":77,"duration":5.22},{"text":"Subsequently, the FBI discovered that in fact Respondent had been convicted of mail fraud and that two of the employers that he had listed on his form in fact had never employed Respondent.","start":77,"stop":91.158,"duration":14.16},{"text":"On the basis of those false statements, Respondent was indicted and convicted for violations of Section 1001.","start":91.158,"stop":99.764,"duration":8.61},{"text":"At trial Respondent's sole defense was that he had not realized that the false information he provided would be forwarded to the federal government.","start":99.764,"stop":110.221,"duration":10.46},{"text":"Both sides in this case agree that the government must establish certain elements in order to make out a violation of Section 1001.","start":110.221,"stop":119.993,"duration":9.77},{"text":"The government must prove that the defendant's statements were false and that he knew it at the time.","start":119.993,"stop":127.433,"duration":7.44},{"text":"Respondent acknowledges here that his statements were false and that he knew that when he filled out and signed the form.","start":127.433,"stop":135.889,"duration":8.46},{"text":"Both sides also agree that the government must establish that a defendant made his statement in a matter within federal agency jurisdiction.","start":135.889,"stop":144.894,"duration":9},{"text":"Respondent agrees with us that his false statements were made in such a matter, since the government security clearance process is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.","start":144.894,"stop":157.535,"duration":12.64}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"May I ask right there, what about the work sheet?","start":157.535,"stop":160.57,"duration":3.03},{"text":"Was that a matter within the jurisdiction?","start":160.57,"stop":163.272,"duration":2.7}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn

Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think that depends on whether the security clearance process worked its way through.","start":180.068,"stop":187.971,"duration":7.9},{"text":"I suppose if the work sheet had been filled out and it had been decided never to proceed with the process that it wouldn't have been in a matter.","start":187.971,"stop":193.875,"duration":5.9}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, suppose the employer had just forwarded the work sheet without having the supplemental document which had on its face the evidence about the security clearance?","start":193.875,"stop":202.647,"duration":8.77}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I would note preliminarily that the work sheet did have some

none.","start":208.135,"stop":208.901,"duration":0.77}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"--was a government document on

hypothetical.","start":209.501,"stop":211.253,"duration":1.75}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, if it hadn't had anything on it, I think it would... and it were

was.","start":222.793,"stop":223.145,"duration":0.35},{"text":"That's precisely the information the government wanted, and they just didn't disclose to the employee that they were making a security clearance.","start":223.145,"stop":229.881,"duration":6.74}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think if the employer had requested the information and requested that the work sheet be filled out for the purpose of forwarding it to the Department of Defense, it would be--","start":229.881,"stop":239.67,"duration":9.79}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Without telling the employee?","start":239.67,"stop":240.606,"duration":0.94}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"--That's correct.","start":240.606,"stop":241.972,"duration":1.37},{"text":"It would be in a matter within federal jurisdiction, regardless of what was said.","start":241.972,"stop":246.593,"duration":4.62}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"So that the employee could be liable under the statute without having any knowledge of federal involvement?","start":246.593,"stop":251.295,"duration":4.7}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, that is our position, that Congress did not intend that the government prove knowledge of federal involvement in a case like this.","start":251.295,"stop":258.901,"duration":7.61},{"text":"That is precisely the point on which the parties disagree in this case, whether the government must prove that the defendant knew that there was federal involvement when he makes a false statement.","start":258.901,"stop":270.875,"duration":11.97},{"text":"Three Court of Appeals, the Fifth, the Sixth, and the Seventh Circuits, have held that such proof is not an element of a Section 1001 offense.","start":270.875,"stop":279.731,"duration":8.86},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit here held that the government is required to prove knowledge of federal involvement.","start":279.731,"stop":286.735,"duration":7},{"text":"Now, this question is similar to one that many federal courts have confronted in the context of a number of different federal statutes.","start":286.735,"stop":294.741,"duration":8.01},{"text":"This Court considered just a question in United States versus Feola.","start":294.741,"stop":300.293,"duration":5.55},{"text":"That case involved a federal statute and the question raised was whether it was necessary for the government to prove that an assailant knew that his victim was a federal officer in order to make out a violation of the federal assault statute.","start":300.293,"stop":316.087,"duration":15.79},{"text":"The Court analyzed Congress' purposes in enacting the statute and it considered whether the element of knowledge was necessary as a matter of fairness, in order to prevent unfairness, and on the basis of that analysis it concluded that Congress in enacting the federal assault statute had intended... had not intended to require the government to prove knowledge of federal involvement on top of all the other elements it was required to prove.","start":316.087,"stop":346.507,"duration":30.42},{"text":"We suggest that in this case the Feola analysis and conclusions apply a fortiori in the case of Section 1001.","start":346.507,"stop":358.064,"duration":11.56},{"text":"We begin with the language, and here I think we have a stronger case than the Court was confronted with in Feola.","start":358.064,"stop":365.92,"duration":7.86},{"text":"There the federal assault statute on its face simply didn't say anything about the required intent.","start":365.92,"stop":373.007,"duration":7.09},{"text":"Here we have a statute that talks about knowingly and willfully making a false statement, so we have words of intent.","start":373.007,"stop":382.513,"duration":9.51},{"text":"But I think it's quite clear from the face of the statute that those words apply to the making of a false statement and not to the separate phrase,","start":382.513,"stop":392.587,"duration":10.07},{"text":"\"in any matter within federal agency jurisdiction. \"","start":392.587,"stop":395.772,"duration":3.19}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Ms. Corwin, does the government agree that the shifting of the language in the 1948 revision was not intended to achieve any substantive result?","start":395.772,"stop":407.247,"duration":11.48}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, and indeed this Court has suggested it wasn't intended.","start":407.247,"stop":411.382,"duration":4.13},{"text":"In Bramblett the Court signified that it had not intended a substantive change.","start":411.382,"stop":415.936,"duration":4.55}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Before '48 the language wasn't quite as favorable to this particular part of your argument as it is now.","start":415.936,"stop":423.69,"duration":7.75}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I'm not sure that that is quite so, although I would not preliminarily that we ought to give some credit to the fact that in 1948 Congress thought it was clarifying an ambiguity; and to the extent that it was attempting to do that I think we ought to read today's statute rather than the older one.","start":423.69,"stop":443.003,"duration":19.31},{"text":"But even if the language had never been shifted, I don't think that changes the fact that that \"in any matter\" phrase has always been somewhat set apart from the rest of the statute and has been phrased in terms that don't sound at all in any sort of intent or purpose.","start":443.003,"stop":461.632,"duration":18.63},{"text":"I think that's significant on the face of the statute, whether you look at the old statute or the recodified version, and I think it's even more significant when you look at the language that had existed prior to the amendment in 1934.","start":461.632,"stop":478.593,"duration":16.96},{"text":"There you had a phrase that, in addition to the knowingly and willfully language, said:","start":478.593,"stop":485.164,"duration":6.57},{"text":"\"Whoever, with the purpose or the intent of cheating or swindling or defrauding the United States, knowingly and willfully makes a false statement. \"","start":485.164,"stop":494.453,"duration":9.29},{"text":"In 1934 Congress replaced that language with this","start":494.453,"stop":499.94,"duration":5.49},{"text":"\"in any matter within federal agency jurisdiction. \"","start":499.94,"stop":502.542,"duration":2.6},{"text":"phrase, a phrase that doesn't sound at all in any sort of intent or purpose.","start":502.542,"stop":507.946,"duration":5.4},{"text":"Now, the Court in Feola looked primarily to the legislative purpose and the legislative history to determine whether Congress would have intended that knowledge of federal involvement be an element of the crime.","start":507.946,"stop":522.722,"duration":14.78},{"text":"Under Section 1001, these factors appear to point at least as clearly as in Feola to the conclusion that knowledge of federal involvement is not something that Congress would have required the government to prove.","start":522.722,"stop":537.648,"duration":14.93},{"text":"This Court has construed Section 1001 on several occasions... in the Gilliland case, in the Bramblett case, and in the Bryson case... and on each occasion the Court has noted the breadth of the statute and the Congressional purpose to afford protection to all sorts of federal functions.","start":537.648,"stop":559.228,"duration":21.58},{"text":"The Court has concluded that it's inappropriate to read the statute restrictively in light of that very broad Congressional purpose in amending the statute in 1934.","start":559.228,"stop":570.303,"duration":11.08},{"text":"Now, the interest in protecting federal functions is one that exists regardless of the individual's knowledge of whether he is involved in a government matter.","start":570.303,"stop":584.011,"duration":13.71},{"text":"In this case, Respondent's false statement concerning his prior conviction and his prior employers had just as much potential to interfere with federal functions, whether or not he knew about whether there was this government security clearance process going on.","start":584.011,"stop":605.376,"duration":21.37}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Do we have any cases in which a defendant has been held criminally liable without having any knowledge that what he was doing might be a crime?","start":605.376,"stop":612.963,"duration":7.59},{"text":"I'm thinking of a case, Mike Royko had a column in the Chicago Tribune about lying to people when they come out in the exit polls.","start":612.963,"stop":622.736,"duration":9.77},{"text":"Supposing an FBI agent were investigating election frauds and didn't tell the people he questioned coming out of the polls that he was doing that, and somebody lied to him.","start":622.736,"stop":632.959,"duration":10.22},{"text":"Under your view it would violate the statute?","start":632.959,"stop":635.395,"duration":2.44}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that something such as the hypothetical you're suggesting may well not violate the statute, although I don't want to take a position on that particular Mike Royko incident.","start":635.395,"stop":647.369,"duration":11.97},{"text":"But I think it's important to recall that the government has to prove a number of things in order to make out a violation of Section 1001 quite apart from the issue we have here.","start":647.369,"stop":658.309,"duration":10.94},{"text":"One of those things it has to prove is that a statement was made willfully.","start":658.309,"stop":664.296,"duration":5.99},{"text":"I think that in such a case as you posit--","start":664.296,"stop":667.616,"duration":3.32}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"It's a deliberate lie, I'm assuming, a deliberate misstatement of how a person voted.","start":667.616,"stop":672.001,"duration":4.38},{"text":"Or maybe an FBI agent comes up to somebody at the bar without telling him he's an FBI agent, he engages him in a conversation, the man lies to him.","start":672.001,"stop":679.59,"duration":7.59}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"--Well, I would suggest that the element of willfulness which is on the face of the statute requires some sort of conscious wrongdoing, and I think the individual who engages in the sort of private conversation or perhaps a conversation in

Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"--Well, I think not.","start":705.223,"stop":709.193,"duration":3.97},{"text":"I mean, in order to make out the violation you have to know that you've made a false

government.","start":714.93,"stop":725.803,"duration":10.87}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Correct.","start":725.803,"stop":726.405,"duration":0.6}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"And I suggest that maybe some of those elements are going to exclude the sort of hypotheticals that you've suggested, and particularly the sort of hypotheticals that Respondent has posed.","start":726.405,"stop":736.277,"duration":9.87}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I assume FBI agents frequently interrogate people without disclosing their identity, and they're engaged in very important federal work.","start":736.277,"stop":745.117,"duration":8.84}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, that's indeed true, and I suggest that perhaps in a different setting, if the FBI agent were working undercover in a business perhaps, you might have a situation in which you would have something you could call willful conduct, something that would very likely violate the state criminal statute of, say, false pretenses, and there you might have coverage because the conduct was willful.","start":745.117,"stop":770.415,"duration":25.3},{"text":"But I don't think, for example in the hypotheticals that Respondent has put forward, which are quite far from his own case--","start":770.415,"stop":777.854,"duration":7.44}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"I agree with those hypotheticals, with your view on those hypotheticals.","start":777.854,"stop":781.04,"duration":3.19},{"text":"But if the neighbor were actually an FBI agent in each of those cases, then you'd be committing a crime without having any

true.","start":789.645,"stop":792.013,"duration":2.37},{"text":"If I were a federal prosecutor who knew I had to make out the elements of knowing falsity and willfulness, I think I would hesitate before I would indict somebody like that.","start":792.013,"stop":802.703,"duration":10.69}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, what is willfulness other than knowing

is.","start":804.405,"stop":808.623,"duration":4.22}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, of course, the statute says \"knowingly and willfully\", and I think that the

criminal offense?","start":863.777,"stop":871.132,"duration":7.35},{"text":"And I suppose not everyone knows that lying about his age, for instance, might be a federal offense.","start":871.132,"stop":878.136,"duration":7}]},{"speakerName":"Carolyn Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, that may be, but I think that in many cases people who make false statements, particularly in a context such as that of Respondent, they are certainly going to know that their conduct is wrongful.","start":878.136,"stop":892.729,"duration":14.59},{"text":"And I suppose it depends on the context, when you suggest the lying about age; and I remind you again that there are things the government has to prove in terms of, for example, materiality, and it may be that a statement like that wouldn't be material.","start":892.729,"stop":909.323,"duration":16.59},{"text":"But I think that a false statement, particularly in the sort of context you have here, in the employment context, is not only going to be something someone knows is wrongful, but is either going to come quite close or arguably falls within the state false pretenses statute, in which you may intend to deceive your employer, and that is something that falls within the state criminal statute.","start":909.323,"stop":937.473,"duration":28.15},{"text":"I think when you consider the sort of broad purposes, the protection of federal functions, that Congress had in mind when it enacted the statute in 1934, you are... it's very difficult to conceive that Congress would have intended to somehow carve out the particular sort of conduct in which Respondent acts in this case.","start":937.473,"stop":961.921,"duration":24.45},{"text":"And I think it's unlikely that Congress would have intended to impose, in addition to all the other elements that the government has to prove, that additional burden of proving that an individual actually knew that he was acting in a matter within

time this comes up, and I think it may well be that...

Respondent's with the sort of simply evidence of knowledge that's circumstantial that you suggest.","start":1027.4,"stop":1055.383,"duration":27.98},{"text":"Now, I think in terms of the legislative
