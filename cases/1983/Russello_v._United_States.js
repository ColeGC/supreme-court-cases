enterprise\".","start":443.164,"stop":468.483,"duration":25.32},{"text":"I would submit that the reason that it is included in (a)(2) and not in (2)(1) is what is missing, what those dots

contractual right of any kind affording the source of influence over is modified by the term \"any enterprise\", since those terms are not used elsewhere in the statute with the said modification.","start":477.307,"stop":518.056,"duration":40.75},{"text":"A lot of the courts and some of the Law Review articles condemn the courts for this, then go into a question of legislative

the references that the government has made to support their concept of legislative history, they are statements, speeches, and parts of the record, Congressional Record, that reflect the opinions of
