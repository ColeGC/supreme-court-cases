turning to not the question of time so much as the extent to which the first judgment insulates he who prevailed in that first litigation, we say that the prevailing party ought to be secure for the time contemplated by the controlling law or contract against an attempt to redetermine the distinct right or title or status that was adjudicated in his favor, even though that right, title or status depends entirely on an overriding question of law, but that he has no vested right in the underlying rule of law.","start":871.762,"stop":928.467,"duration":56.71},{"text":"He has a vested right in the resulting title or entitlement or right or status which came to him personally as a result of applying that rule of law, and no challenge to that resulting title or right can properly be brought

year.","start":956.801,"stop":960.419,"duration":3.62},{"text":"One cannot relitigate whether or not a taxpayer is or is not owing certain taxes or is entirely exempt within the given tax

citizenship.","start":973.496,"stop":988.089,"duration":14.59},{"text":"That is... becomes a vested right in the judgment.","start":988.089,"stop":994.659,"duration":6.57},{"text":"But the underlying rule of law that led to that result is fully open to relitigation, even as against the same party if occasion should arise.","start":994.659,"stop":1007.567,"duration":12.91},{"text":"Now, this is saying something more than merely giving res judicata effect to the first judgment, because that entitlement to citizenship, for instance, in the case of the 68 veterans, works not only to prevent the Government from bringing another lawsuit to immediately challenge the citizenship, but it prevents the Government from denying on a wholly separate lawsuit the benefits that may flow from citizenship, even though it's a quite distinct context.","start":1007.567,"stop":1046.461,"duration":38.89},{"text":"That is, it seems to us, the same rule that was applied in the Moser
