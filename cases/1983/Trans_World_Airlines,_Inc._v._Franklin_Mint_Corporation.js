adhere to this treaty, the laws of many countries require limitations of liability which are much lower than the Warsaw Convention, and the Warsaw Convention says that the limit will be no higher than $20 per kilo, but it also says any agreement entered into prior to the loss which would result in a limit lower than $20 a kilo is void, so, the convention establishes both a floor and a ceiling.","start":381.114,"stop":418.788,"duration":37.67},{"text":"The Court of Appeals based its opinion on the fact that one section of the Par Value Modification Act had been repealed, and that is
