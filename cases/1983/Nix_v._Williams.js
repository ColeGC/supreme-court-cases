that the evidence he wants can be obtained lawfully, the less incentive there is for him to commit a deliberate constitutional violation, because if he does so he knows that he's risking the

be obtained through lawful means.","start":1421.152,"stop":1452.073,"duration":30.92},{"text":"Now, on the other hand, if he's not certain that the evidence he wants can be obtained lawfully, then
