this case is about, because many items in the brief deal with issues that are not really here.","start":31.119,"stop":40.708,"duration":9.59},{"text":"I think Judge Ferguson, in the Court of Appeals in the dissent, very distinctly put it in the beginning of that, that this is, in effect, a case dealing with the subject of a male person who has been judicially determined to be mentally unable to engage in the practice of law in the State of Arizona, may still maintain a $2,200,000 damage action under the Federal antitrust laws against the Committee on Examination and Admission of the Arizona Supreme Court for failing to give him a passing grade on the state bar examination.","start":40.708,"stop":73.262,"duration":32.55},{"text":"Looking at what the case is about, we are here contending that on at least four principal bases we should prevail, that is the committee members should not be subject to this kind of action.","start":73.262,"stop":86.272,"duration":13.01},{"text":"Three of those are state action items.","start":86.272,"stop":88.788,"duration":2.52},{"text":"The first is that we contend that we are involved in state action as the state, as the sovereign.","start":88.788,"stop":95.128,"duration":6.34},{"text":"Secondly, failing that particular test in your view, that we are involved in state action as a subdivision of the state.","start":95.128,"stop":104.4,"duration":9.27},{"text":"Thirdly, failing that, that we would be involved in state actions as a private party, although we do concur with the amicus position of

tests.","start":104.4,"stop":120.159,"duration":15.76},{"text":"Fourthly, that if there is no state action involved at all, then the Noerr-Pennington doctrine would apply insofar as antitrust matters are concerned.","start":120.159,"stop":129.099,"duration":8.94},{"text":"The principal basis of the state action doctrine, as an exemption from the antitrust laws, is federalism.","start":129.099,"stop":139.288,"duration":10.19},{"text":"I think something again ought to be kept in mind that taking the case as it is, as a pleadings case, and assuming that the members of the committee did all of the wrongful things that either the complaint alleges or that the briefs infer, the federal antitrust laws are not the basis upon which to redress this matter.","start":139.288,"stop":163.372,"duration":24.08},{"text":"There are plenty of remedies available to Mr. Ronwin, to anyone in Mr. Ronwin's position, to in effect have his day in court, to have

these facts were presented to them, and they have been brought to this Court, not once, but he has gone to the State of Arizona on three different occasions and been turned down, and to this Court,
