Cuba.","start":37.467,"stop":39.545,"duration":2.08},{"text":"The embargo that is involved here is very much like the Iranian assets control program that was before the Court in Dames & Moore, and the

Cuban goods and services only if the travel involves Government business or involves journalism or involves scholarly research or a visit to close relatives, or if it is authorized by a specific

Cuba unless you fall within one of the licensed categories.","start":123.369,"stop":130.384,"duration":7.01},{"text":"The 1982 regulations here modified a general license which had been issued by President Carter in March of 1977... that's an important date... which gave permission to Americans to spend American dollars when they went to Cuba.","start":130.384,"stop":149.905,"duration":19.52},{"text":"Now, that general license itself was, however, subject to important qualifications on the flow of American travel dollars to Cuba.","start":149.905,"stop":159.697,"duration":9.79},{"text":"For instance, American credit card companies were not allowed to make credit card arrangements in Cuba, and that made it harder for Americans to travel on credit.","start":159.697,"stop":169.209,"duration":9.51},{"text":"Perhaps more significant, travelers who wanted to go to Cuba under that general license pretty much had to arrange for charter travel, because financial transactions in connection with any scheduled voyages to Cuba were not permitted by that license.","start":169.209,"stop":185.921,"duration":16.71},{"text":"Both the '77 license and the '82 modifications were part of the overall Cuban assets control regulations, regulations that

licensure.","start":185.921,"stop":208.426,"duration":22.5},{"text":"Section 201(b) of the Cuban assets control regulations has since '63 provided that no economic transaction in which Cuba has any interest may go forward without a license from the Treasury, so that by the terms of regulation 201(b) it has been unlawful since 1963 to spend American dollars in connection with travel to Cuba unless you had a Treasury license.","start":208.426,"stop":236.728,"duration":28.3},{"text":"Now, from '63 to '77 these licenses were issued on an individual basis to particular

1982.","start":244.601,"stop":252.142,"duration":7.54},{"text":"The legal issue before the Court is whether there is a valid legal authority for the 1982 modifications.","start":252.142,"stop":260.671,"duration":8.53},{"text":"The Cuban assets control regulations were themselves issued under Section 5(b) of the TWEA, Trading With the Enemy Act, which

which Cuba... in which a foreign country or a foreign national has any interest.","start":260.671,"stop":291.236,"duration":30.57},{"text":"Now, as explained in our briefs, the question in the case

the President pretty much the same substantive authority as he had under the TWEA.","start":319.475,"stop":325.271,"duration":5.8},{"text":"In fact, IEEPA replicates the Section 5(b) TWEA language relevant to this case.","start":325.271,"stop":331.83,"duration":6.56},{"text":"But IEEPA lays down new procedures and new predicates for the exercise of those peacetime

specific examples in the legislative history where it was indicated that what would be grandfathered was an embargo system, not simply a kind of frozen list of specific prohibitions, because there was no reference, certainly no reference to anything involving the fact that travel was not to be regulated.","start":760.928,"stop":794.854,"duration":33.93},{"text":"There is no specific indication of that in the history of the grandfather clause.","start":794.854,"stop":799.4,"duration":4.55},{"text":"Congress must have been aware, Your Honor, that assets controls programs generally have been ongoing and rather flexible systems, subject to adjustment from time to time.","start":799.4,"stop":813.704,"duration":14.3},{"text":"There is another point here, which is that travel in fact was

transactions.","start":813.704,"stop":831.01,"duration":17.31},{"text":"Now, that fact, of course, must be a major embarrassment to the Respondents' theory of this

important question.","start":840.837,"stop":843.754,"duration":2.92},{"text":"On July 1, '77, President Carter was in fact prohibiting certain financial transactions incident to personal travel, including all transactions incident to scheduled travel.","start":843.754,"stop":857.483,"duration":13.73},{"text":"Now, how, in light of that, can it be said that the authority to regulate travel-related financial expenditures was not being exercised?","start":857.483,"stop":865.48,"duration":8},{"text":"I remind the Court, too, that the '77 general license, which is so critical to the Court of Appeals' theory of this case, was explicitly by regulation subject to revocation and modification, and in that respect we think this case is governed and controlled by Dames & Moore, because in Dames & Moore the Court explicitly held that a general license subject to revocation is a contingent instrument, subordinate to the President's continuing underlying regulatory authority, and that reasoning seems to us compelling here.","start":865.48,"stop":901.591,"duration":36.11},{"text":"I want to go back to Justice O'Connor's question, which I think is really the heart of the case.","start":901.591,"stop":908.087,"duration":6.5},{"text":"What could Congress have had in mind when they grandfathered this?","start":908.087,"stop":912.696,"duration":4.61},{"text":"We think that it is simply an incoherent account of what Congress could have meant to suppose that they were simply freezing an existing laundry list of specific prohibitions.","start":912.696,"stop":928.455,"duration":15.76},{"text":"We don't think this is a sensible or a credible reading.","start":928.455,"stop":931.812,"duration":3.36},{"text":"I don't think Congress could have wished to freeze the North Korean and the Vietnamese and the Cuban embargoes so that the President couldn't fill in loopholes or gaps, that he couldn't clarify coverage, that he couldn't add a restriction, for instance, in connection with a negotiation to create an incentive for settlement.","start":931.812,"stop":955.365,"duration":23.55},{"text":"The ironic thing actually is that under the Court of Appeals' reading the executive may even be disabled from amending an embargo to implement a negotiated settlement with another country, because that settlement might call for the addition of new 5(b) measures, as indeed happened in the Iranian settlement.","start":955.365,"stop":974.906,"duration":19.54},{"text":"Again perhaps for example to look at the general license, it's an interesting example, because when it was first issued in March of '77 it did not include the restriction on financial transactions incident to scheduled travel.","start":974.906,"stop":991.571,"duration":16.67},{"text":"That was added in May of '77.","start":991.571,"stop":994.13,"duration":2.56},{"text":"Now, suppose it had been added in August

it?","start":997.85,"stop":1002.472,"duration":4.62},{"text":"That was obviously an afterthought or, if you will, the filling in of something that was just overlooked.","start":1002.472,"stop":1008.172,"duration":5.7},{"text":"But that kind of adjustment could not be made, we don't think that it creates a coherent system.","start":1008.172,"stop":1014.918,"duration":6.75},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals' answer to this was, use IEEPA.","start":1014.918,"stop":1019.056,"duration":4.14},{"text":"But to use IEPPA requires the President to issue a new national emergency declaration, and a declaration that Cuba or Vietnam represents an unusual or extraordinary threat to the United States.","start":1019.056,"stop":1035.16,"duration":16.1},{"text":"And Justice O'Connor, if there's anything clear from the legislative history, it is that the Congress was persuaded by the

extraordinary embargoes.","start":1035.16,"stop":1057.337,"duration":22.18},{"text":"The purpose of Congress to allow the President to maintain these four extraordinary embargoes without declaring a new national emergency would simply be frustrated if what we say is that the only thing that can be preserved is a frozen list of restrictions, that is, that a new declaration has to be made every
