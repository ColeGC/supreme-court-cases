protected.","start":863.024,"stop":865.96,"duration":2.94},{"text":"On the other side of the line, there is one group of women who are not eligible for benefits under pre-Goldfarb law but are now eligible for such benefits.","start":865.96,"stop":874.649,"duration":8.69},{"text":"That is the group of divorced wives and surviving divorced wives who were married more than ten but less than twenty years.","start":874.649,"stop":881.837,"duration":7.19},{"text":"Because they were not eligible under pre-Goldfarb law, they do not come within the exception, and, therefore, are subject to the offset.","start":881.837,"stop":890.793,"duration":8.96},{"text":"In addition, non-dependent men after Goldfarb who make no claim of reliance on that decision, who were unaware of it or admit that it

protected.","start":905.87,"stop":908.589,"duration":2.72},{"text":"So, there are men and women on both sides of the line of the offset and the distinguishing characteristic between them is the reliance interests of the category in which they fall.","start":908.589,"stop":918.428,"duration":9.84},{"text":"The protection of reliance interests as those lines suggest was the very purpose that Congress had in mind in enacting the exception provision.","start":918.428,"stop":930.068,"duration":11.64},{"text":"Congress was concerned in particular about the reliance interests of retirees who had planned their retirements in accordance with the long-standing provisions of the Social Security Act that Congress had passed and that had been on the books since 1939.","start":930.068,"stop":948.03,"duration":17.96},{"text":"The legislative record makes clear that this is the purpose that Congress actually had in its collective mind in enacting the

here.","start":957.42,"stop":965.158,"duration":7.74},{"text":"Congress did not indulge in archaic or sterotypical assumptions about the role of women in our society and did not adopt the exception

was.","start":1005.735,"stop":1010.37,"duration":4.63},{"text":"But, we think, if anything, the five-year period was on the short rather than the long side of the permissible spectrum given the nature of retirement earnings.","start":1010.37,"stop":1019.31,"duration":8.94},{"text":"Someone who is six years from retirement might well be hard pressed in that relatively short period of time to make up the reliance that has been bashed as a result of the offset.","start":1019.31,"stop":1029.601,"duration":10.29},{"text":"But, Congress felt that five years was appropriate and there is certainly nothing to suggest that that determination was impermissible in any way.","start":1029.601,"stop":1037.088,"duration":7.49},{"text":"It is a line-drawn problem inherent in the

reliance interests that motivated Congress, we submit, is a legitimate and important governmental interest.","start":1042.741,"stop":1052.716,"duration":9.97},{"text":"We think that proposition is sound and self-evident on its face, especially given the nature of the Social Security system and the nature of the retirement planning process.","start":1052.716,"stop":1067.041,"duration":14.33},{"text":"I also think that this Court's decisions in a wide range of areas have recognized reliance interests of much the same sort.","start":1067.041,"stop":1075.713,"duration":8.67},{"text":"It was not improper for Congress to be concerned about the hardship and disruption that would have been caused if the new offset

law.","start":1075.713,"stop":1094.876,"duration":19.16},{"text":"In addition to that purpose being important and legitimate, we also submit that the exception clause is substantially related to the achievement of that purpose and it rests on a reasoned analysis of the statutory classification.","start":1094.876,"stop":1112.319,"duration":17.44},{"text":"Indeed, by incorporating the pre-Goldfarb law in the exception provision, the exception is precisely suited to the protection of that reliance interest.","start":1112.319,"stop":1125.311,"duration":12.99},{"text":"In addition, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, the exception is limited to a transitional five-year period which Congress determined was a reasonable time to protect people against the disruption of their retirement plans.","start":1125.311,"stop":1143.357,"duration":18.05},{"text":"We also would point out that when the exception clause expired by its own terms in December of 1982, and, thus, the pre-Goldfarb reliance interests had then been satisfied, Congress twice reconsidered the offset provision and on both occasions it enacted an gender-neutral provision.","start":1143.357,"stop":1164.02,"duration":20.66},{"text":"We think that confirms what was evident in the initial Act, that Congress limited the gender-based classification to what was necessary to protect the pre-Goldfarb reliance interest.","start":1164.02,"stop":1177.53,"duration":13.51},{"text":"Finally, in enacting the exception and offset in 1977, Congress considered other alternatives, but it rejected them as less desirable.","start":1177.53,"stop":1191.171,"duration":13.64},{"text":"The legislative record makes it clear that Congress adopted the offset and exception provisions as a deliberate policy choice in preference to other approaches they might have taken.","start":1191.171,"stop":1205.863,"duration":14.69},{"text":"Now, Appellee seeks to upset Congress' policy choice and makes two arguments that the exception is unconstitutional.","start":1205.863,"stop":1215.119,"duration":9.26},{"text":"First, he argues that the protection of the pre-Goldfarb reliance interest was not a legitimate and important governmental objective.","start":1215.119,"stop":1225.927,"duration":10.81},{"text":"As Congress recognized though, and we think it quite plain, we don't... The reliance interests of people under the prior law, in accordance with the provisions passed by Congress and in effect since 1939, cannot be so easily dismissed.","start":1225.927,"stop":1243.306,"duration":17.38},{"text":"Such reliance is not discredited in any way by the fact that this Court in Goldfarb ultimately held the statute to violate equal protection.","start":1243.306,"stop":1253.928,"duration":10.62},{"text":"As in cases such as Lemon versus Kurtzman and the Manhart and the Norris decisions, reliance on a prior state of the law, even

under prior law.","start":1253.928,"stop":1280.229,"duration":26.3},{"text":"Appellee also makes a second argument that the statutory classification here is underinclusive because it doesn't protect the asserted reliance interests of non-dependent men who claim to have relied on Goldfarb between the time it was announced in March of 1977, and the enactment of the offset provisions in December 1977, and who did not file a valid application for spousal benefits prior to the effective date of the offset, December 1, 1977.","start":1280.229,"stop":1315.55,"duration":35.32},{"text":"We don't

Goldfarb.","start":1315.55,"stop":1330.494,"duration":14.94},{"text":"Congress could conclude, in the context of the pressing need for the offset itself... and it is important to remember that the offset is the principal provision here to which the exception is a specific exemption... in that context Congress could concluded that the reliance interest advanced by Appellee was less substantial and less deserving of protection than the long-standing reliance interest under the statute passed by Congress prior to Goldfarb.","start":1330.494,"stop":1359.062,"duration":28.57},{"text":"As Justice Stevens and I discussed before, there are men and women on both sides of the line.","start":1359.062,"stop":1367.251,"duration":8.19},{"text":"The interest that Appellee asserts was based on the Goldfarb decision.","start":1367.251,"stop":1375.69,"duration":8.44},{"text":"Let me come at it this way.","start":1375.69,"stop":1376.856,"duration":1.17},{"text":"That was a very recent decision at the time and Congress could reasonably have concluded that it was unlikely to have lead to widespread and significant reliance.","start":1376.856,"stop":1387.264,"duration":10.41},{"text":"In addition, it was possible, as in fact turned out to be the case, that Congress would pass a statute in response to the Goldfarb decision and that statute would affect the newly recognized claims of non-dependent men such as Appellee.","start":1387.264,"stop":1406.31,"duration":19.05},{"text":"Neither of those considerations applies to the reliance interests of the pre-Goldfarb retirees.","start":1406.31,"stop":1413.065,"duration":6.76},{"text":"And, for that reason, we think the statute is perfectly constitutional to distinguish between those groups and does not raise any constitutional difficulties because it is limited to the interest that Congress found to be more substantial and more worthy of
