case would fall within the Court's general parameters of a case capable of repetition yet evading review because of the short time limitation and the time it takes to get a case up to this Court.","start":723.253,"stop":736.265,"duration":13.01},{"text":"Another statutory goal that cannot be accomplished under Title I is that of specifying that the statute only specifies minimal government intervention in union affairs and leaves it to the unions to establish rules in its bylaws as to how the election will be conducted.","start":736.265,"stop":759.457,"duration":23.19},{"text":"The union has been found to be free to conduct its elections in accordance with its own procedures so long as the procedures comply with the statute.","start":759.457,"stop":769.173,"duration":9.72},{"text":"Here in contrast the District Court issued an injunction which provided for detailed rules, took the entire administration of the election procedures out of the hands of the union and placed them into the hands of arbitrators that it happened to find willing to conduct this type of an election.","start":769.173,"stop":786.167,"duration":16.99},{"text":"Most importantly, congressional history indicates an intent to reserve challenges to the conduct of the election until after the election has been completed and to prevent any faction in the union from delaying the election, and even once that election was completed if a member sought to challenge its outcome, court intervention was to be delayed until after the union was given an opportunity to review the problem and attempt to redress the grievance.","start":786.167,"stop":820.324,"duration":34.16},{"text":"Then if a member was dissatisfied with the union's action until the Secretary of Labor, the agent of government most familiar with

election.","start":820.324,"stop":838.474,"duration":18.15},{"text":"Elections were not to be set aside merely for technical violations, and they were only to be set aside after a hearing on the merits of a case.","start":838.474,"stop":847.486,"duration":9.01},{"text":"Here the relief that was granted was granted after a hearing on a preliminary injunction.","start":847.486,"stop":854.265,"duration":6.78},{"text":"There never was a hearing on the merits.","start":854.265,"stop":856.67,"duration":2.4},{"text":"The Respondents were not required to exhaust the internal union procedures, and the union was not given full advantage of those procedures to remedy this matter itself.","start":856.67,"stop":867.977,"duration":11.31},{"text":"There was no compliance with the time limitations which severely restrict the amount of time that the Secretary of Labor has to investigate a complaint and file a suit.","start":867.977,"stop":878.551,"duration":10.57},{"text":"Most importantly the procedures entirely ignored the Secretary of Labor, precluding him from investigating the complaint, precluding him from being able to attempt to settle a complaint before it was actually filed in court, precluding him from serving as a screening agent to prevent the court from spending time on frivolous issues, and preventing him from consolidating all of the potential litigation concerning the outcome of the election in one proceeding before one court.","start":878.551,"stop":913.693,"duration":35.14},{"text":"In fact, by deciding some of the issues here under Title I but deferring other issues for a Title IV proceeding, the District Court in essence insured that there will be two elections, two suits to challenge the outcome of this election.","start":913.693,"stop":930.405,"duration":16.71},{"text":"Indeed, by not resolving the 24 consecutive month continuous good standing eligibility requirement the court did not even guarantee that his own election was to be protected from a challenge after that election had been challenged.","start":930.405,"stop":946.696,"duration":16.29},{"text":"Thus, we do not believe that the statutory goals can be accomplished in a proceeding under Title I.","start":946.696,"stop":957.66,"duration":10.96},{"text":"For that reason we do not believe that it can ever be appropriate within the meaning of Section 102 for a court acting under Title I to
