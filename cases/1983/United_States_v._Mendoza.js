though this Court had just decided in Hibi that Attorney General Clarke's actions in withdrawing this naturalization examiner for nine months did not constitute affirmative Government misconduct, the district court in 68 Filipinos held that this very same conduct constituted a violation of the due process clause, and the court therefore ordered the Government to grant citizenship to the Filipino plaintiffs in that case as a remedy for the due process violation.","start":414.392,"stop":450.666,"duration":36.27},{"text":"It's important to mention at this point that 68 Filipinos was not a class

Commissioner of Immigration took a look at the case and recommended that the appeal in 68 Filipinos be withdrawn.","start":467.407,"stop":475.805,"duration":8.4},{"text":"The Commissioner did not suggest in his memos to the Justice Department that the case had been correctly decided, but he suggested that it would be in keeping with the immigration policies of the new Administration to withdraw the appeal in that case and let those 68 Filipinos become citizens pursuant to the district court's order.","start":475.805,"stop":495.115,"duration":19.31},{"text":"There was substantial disagreement within the Justice Department as to this recommendation, but ultimately the appeal in 68 Filipinos was withdrawn in November 1977.","start":495.115,"stop":507.043,"duration":11.93},{"text":"Now, almost immediately after the decision was made to withdraw the appeal the Justice Department began to reassess whether it had acted wisely.","start":507.043,"stop":517.272,"duration":10.23},{"text":"In part, this was due to the fact that the Commissioner of Immigration had been summoned to Capitol Hill to explain the reasons why the Government had decided to drop the appeal in the 68 Filipinos case, even though the district court's decision seemed to be inconsistent with Hibi.","start":517.272,"stop":532.349,"duration":15.08},{"text":"The upshot of the Government's reassessment was that in April 1978 the Justice Department decided that henceforth it would continue to oppose the naturalization of Filipino veterans who, A, were not eligible for citizenship under current law, and who, B, had made no attempt to apply for citizenship under Section 701 and 702 during the period of time that those laws were in effect back in 1945 and 1946.","start":532.349,"stop":563.001,"duration":30.65},{"text":"Now, Respondent Mendoza is one of that category of Filipinos.","start":563.001,"stop":567.595,"duration":4.59},{"text":"He is not eligible for citizenship under current law and he made no effort to apply for citizenship under Sections 701 and 702

assessment.","start":603.506,"stop":606.32,"duration":2.81},{"text":"At the time the memos were written as to whether the appeal should be withdrawn, there was an estimate that there might be as many

concern--","start":617.436,"stop":632.795,"duration":15.36}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"But then the Commissioner Castillo testified that there were only about 100

the number who had applied for relief under Sections 701 and 702, but with the fact that if these people became citizens then all of their relatives would be entitled to a number of preferences under the immigration laws.","start":638.431,"stop":657.432,"duration":19},{"text":"We have argued, we argued in the lower courts, that in part the decision to reinstate the Government's position in April '78 was due to a reassessment of the number of Filipino veterans who would be subject to these laws.","start":657.432,"stop":671.52,"duration":14.09},{"text":"But in part I think it's fair to say that the reassessment was based on the conclusion that it had been unwise as a matter of law to drop the appeal.","start":671.52,"stop":679.177,"duration":7.66}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul

people.","start":690.984,"stop":696.097,"duration":5.11},{"text":"Now, as I said, the Respondent Mendoza is a member of this group, category two in Judge Renfrew's terminology.","start":696.097,"stop":706.115,"duration":10.02},{"text":"When he applied for citizenship in 1978, the Government opposed because he is not eligible for citizenship under the current law

district court treated this case as simply a routine application of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel.","start":723.426,"stop":730.379,"duration":6.95},{"text":"The court held that, since the

levels.","start":747.582,"stop":753.126,"duration":5.54},{"text":"If we approach the case simply as a technical legal matter, it seems clear that the Ninth Circuit simply misapplied black-letter principles of estoppel law.","start":753.126,"stop":763.301,"duration":10.18},{"text":"The Court of Appeals simply relied on this Court's decision in Parklane Hosiery, without realizing that Parklane

is that estoppel on a pure or unmixed question of law is never appropriate unless, at a minimum, there are the same parties to the two lawsuits and the two lawsuits involve the same so-called \"demand\", to use the Moser and Montana terminology.","start":780.391,"stop":808.862,"duration":28.47},{"text":"Now, those requirements were plainly not met here because Mendoza was not a party to
