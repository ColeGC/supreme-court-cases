Court.","start":79.416,"stop":82.535,"duration":3.12},{"text":"Recently in South Dakota versus Neville this Court again decried the carnage caused by drunken drivers on our highways.","start":82.535,"stop":91.724,"duration":9.19},{"text":"Spurred on by increasing public awareness, and encouraged by the federal government, the states are stepping up law enforcement efforts to combat this national problem, and one of the most effective tools in law enforcement's arsenal is the breath alcohol test.","start":91.724,"stop":108.4,"duration":16.68},{"text":"Such tests are used in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.","start":108.4,"stop":114.22,"duration":5.82},{"text":"In California, which I am sure is typical, breath alcohol tests are used in two-thirds of all drunk driving arrests.","start":114.22,"stop":123.445,"duration":9.22},{"text":"Evidential breath test instruments provide a rapid, economical, and accurate means of immediately determining the suspect's blood alcohol content.","start":123.445,"stop":135.586,"duration":12.14},{"text":"Because they are self-contained, automatic units, they can be easily and accurately operated by a field officer with minimal training.","start":135.586,"stop":145.541,"duration":9.95},{"text":"The ease and rapidity of operation allows the officer to complete the test quickly and return to the highway to do his job.","start":145.541,"stop":154.797,"duration":9.26},{"text":"Immediate results also permit additional sample collection where an unexpectedly low result suggests intoxication by combination of alcohol and drugs.","start":154.797,"stop":167.641,"duration":12.84},{"text":"Breath testing is also the least intrusive of the options from the suspect's point of view.","start":167.641,"stop":174.628,"duration":6.99},{"text":"It does not involve bodily intrusion or invasion of privacy, and assures the shortest period of detention.","start":174.628,"stop":182.199,"duration":7.57},{"text":"Breath testing is broadly accepted as valid.","start":182.199,"stop":185.935,"duration":3.74},{"text":"Self-contained devices avoid the possibility of human error or manipulation and allow subsequent checks upon the accuracy of the test system.","start":185.935,"stop":196.891,"duration":10.96},{"text":"Now, this case is here on certiorari.","start":196.891,"stop":200.528,"duration":3.64},{"text":"After a California Court of Appeals held unconstitutional as a violation of federal due process use of an evidential breath test instrument unless that device preserves the breath sample actually tested for possible retesting by the defendant or alternatively a procedure is followed which collects an equivalent sample for the defendant's use.","start":200.528,"stop":227.262,"duration":26.73},{"text":"In the context of this particular case, the instrument at issue is an Intoxolizer, widely used on a national basis, and constituting 82 percent of the evidential breath test devices in California.","start":227.262,"stop":241.605,"duration":14.34},{"text":"Now, I will first focus on the machine itself, and then I am going to outline why its use does not offend due process.","start":241.605,"stop":250.628,"duration":9.02},{"text":"The Intoxolizer does not save any sample for possible retesting.","start":250.628,"stop":256.365,"duration":5.74},{"text":"In use, the suspect blows through a tube leading into a chamber within the machine.","start":256.365,"stop":263.619,"duration":7.25},{"text":"When the device determines that the air deep in the lungs has been reached, the sample is momentarily held for analysis using infrared light, and the blood alcohol content is measured.","start":263.619,"stop":275.493,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Then the test sample is automatically pumped out of the machine, and the chamber is purged with clear air.","start":275.493,"stop":282.147,"duration":6.65},{"text":"The purge cycle promotes test integrity by ensuring that no residual alcohol remains as a contaminant, that the instrument is starting from zero, and that no capricious event occurs to interfere with test accuracy.","start":282.147,"stop":297.157,"duration":15.01},{"text":"It is actually a diagnostic step which protects the defendant.","start":297.157,"stop":302.061,"duration":4.9},{"text":"The machine must be purged to prepare it for another test on that same person or another individual.","start":302.061,"stop":309.583,"duration":7.52},{"text":"Thus the test sample purged to clear the machine is automatically destroyed as an integral part of the analytical process, and it is never collected or reduced to a form which permits practical retention.","start":309.583,"stop":325.093,"duration":15.51},{"text":"The decision of the Court of Appeal by its terms extends not only to the Intoxolizer but to all evidential breath test machines.","start":325.093,"stop":335.615,"duration":10.52},{"text":"The others approved for use in California also destroy the sample during the testing process.","start":335.615,"stop":341.519,"duration":5.9},{"text":"Hence the decision condemns as unconstitutional all California breath testing, and should such a rule be extended to the other states, will greatly impair the effort to control the drinking driver.","start":341.519,"stop":354.778,"duration":13.26},{"text":"The great national concern over this disquieting prospect is reflected

absolute certainty.","start":527.657,"stop":537.012,"duration":9.35},{"text":"The Hitch-Trombetta preservation requirement is predicated upon a claimed need to provide the defendant with any evidence

true.","start":753.888,"stop":755.088,"duration":1.2},{"text":"Nor would a preserved or separately collected sample yield material evidence, since reanalysis is itself subject to error and cannot be verified.","start":755.088,"stop":765.346,"duration":10.26},{"text":"Thus a discrepancy between the evidential breath test results and the results of referee analysis creates a conflict in the evidence which can be resolved but only by going back to the evidential breath test and rechecking its accuracy.","start":765.346,"stop":781.122,"duration":15.78},{"text":"This can already be done without a preserved sample.","start":781.122,"stop":783.974,"duration":2.85},{"text":"Trombetta thus imposes a duty of preservation yielding at most inconclusive results, creating the circular route
