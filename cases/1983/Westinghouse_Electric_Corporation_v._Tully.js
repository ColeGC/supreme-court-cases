question.","start":124.976,"stop":131.431,"duration":6.46},{"text":"Under the Internal Revenue Code as it was in effect during the relevant period, a taxpayer was essentially permitted to defer federal taxes on 50 percent of income allocated to the DISC until that income is distributed to the parent.","start":131.431,"stop":146.52,"duration":15.09},{"text":"Turning to Westinghouse, Westinghouse and its affiliates are engaged in a variety of businesses, some of which exports products, a portion of the income from which during the relevant period was allocated by Westinghouse to the DISC.","start":146.52,"stop":162.249,"duration":15.73},{"text":"During the years here in question, 1972 and 1973, approximately 75 to 80 percent of the Westinghouse DISC income was derived from Westinghouse exports, approximately 20 to 25 percent from affiliates of Westinghouse.","start":162.249,"stop":179.831,"duration":17.58},{"text":"The record in this case establishes that the affiliates of Westinghouse did no business in New York.","start":179.831,"stop":186.165,"duration":6.33},{"text":"It further establishes that the affiliates are autonomous, independently managed, and deal with Westinghouse on an arm's length basis.","start":186.165,"stop":194.139,"duration":7.97},{"text":"The State of New York does not treat these affiliates as unitary with Westinghouse and has not attempted to tax their income in recognition of the fact that they do not do business in the State of New York.","start":194.139,"stop":205.879,"duration":11.74},{"text":"The tax practices here at

the amount of income which the State of New York taxes, it first attempts to determine the taxpayer's total income.","start":224.84,"stop":234.647,"duration":9.81},{"text":"It then multiplies it by a fraction which is determined by the relationship of the taxpayer's New York property, payroll and revenue to the total payroll, property and revenue of the taxpayer.","start":234.647,"stop":246.946,"duration":12.3},{"text":"In determining the amount of a taxpayer's income to be apportioned to New York, the state in this case added to the income of Westinghouse the total income of its DISC, including the amount on which federal taxes were deferred, and including the amount derived by reason of exports by Westinghouse non-New York affiliates.","start":246.946,"stop":272.041,"duration":25.1},{"text":"Having determined the income apportioned to New York, the state then applied a tax rate of 9 percent to that income as allocated to the State of New York.","start":272.041,"stop":284.61,"duration":12.57},{"text":"In computing the tax actually due, however, the court took another step, and that is, it permitted a credit with respect to 70 percent of the tax due on accumulated DISC income.","start":284.61,"stop":298.729,"duration":14.12},{"text":"And it is that credit which is at issue in this case, because the State of New York, although it permits that credit, it permits it only with respect to exports which are shipped from a regular place of business in the State of New York.","start":298.729,"stop":313.639,"duration":14.91},{"text":"More specifically, in calculating the credit, the New York statute requires the taxpayer to multiply its accumulated DISC income by a fraction of which the numerator is gross receipts shipped from New York, and the denominator gross receipts from exports shipped from all sources.","start":313.639,"stop":334.422,"duration":20.78},{"text":"In this case the result was to limit the credit permitted Westinghouse to approximately 5 percent of the accumulated DISC income which New York taxed.","start":334.422,"stop":347.282,"duration":12.86},{"text":"Of course, with respect to other corporations which have their base of operations in New York, such as General Electric, the credit is much greater.","start":347.282,"stop":355.846,"duration":8.56},{"text":"The basic result of New York's limitation on the availability of the credit is that if a firm ships exports from New York, it will pay a tax of 2.7 percent on accumulated DISC income attributed to that shipment, but if it ships that export from New Jersey or any state other than New York, it will pay a tax of 9 percent.","start":355.846,"stop":381.874,"duration":26.03},{"text":"But in terms of dollars, if you assume a corporation with $100 million of accumulated DISC income, 50 percent of which is apportioned to the State of New York, that taxpayer will pay to the State of New York a tax in the amount $4,500,000 if it ships from non-New York facilities, but if it ships from New York
