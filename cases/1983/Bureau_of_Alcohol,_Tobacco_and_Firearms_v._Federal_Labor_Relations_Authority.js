reading into the statute a requirement that has the effect of imposing a monetary liability on the federal government, and you have that reading in the absence of any expression of congressional

this agency or what our standard of review is.","start":698.57,"stop":707.161,"duration":8.59},{"text":"Do we just approach it as a brand new question of statutory construction, or do we attach some

Frances Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think the general principle that you have set out is one with which we agree that an administrative agency normally does deserve deference.","start":719.611,"stop":728.37,"duration":8.76},{"text":"I think there are several points to consider here.","start":728.37,"stop":731.7,"duration":3.33},{"text":"First, I think even if one

Corwin","textObjs":[{"text":"No, I think that is not the case because Congress clearly had in mind that the remedies ordered by the Authority would involve things like back pay, and it did include

basis.","start":783.782,"stop":804.917,"duration":21.13},{"text":"It referred to the Section 5596.","start":804.917,"stop":808.586,"duration":3.67},{"text":"The Back Pay Act, which is outside of Title VII.","start":808.586,"stop":811.086,"duration":2.5},{"text":"Here you do not have any reference to the particular Chapter 57 that relates to travel expenses and per diem so you do not have Congress making the same sort of cross-reference indicating that it acknowledged that there would be some sort of monetary liability, and I think that is another point that the Authority here felt it necessary to go outside of the limitations of its own statute, outside of Title VII and to refer to Chapter 57 which is not within its responsibility for construction.","start":811.086,"stop":844.213,"duration":33.13},{"text":"Rather it is within the General Service Administration's realm of authority.","start":844.213,"stop":848.725,"duration":4.51},{"text":"I think another point to consider when you determining the deference that is due here is that the particular statutory scheme is one in which Congress did not leave much in the way of gaps or interstices for authority to fill.","start":848.725,"stop":867.419,"duration":18.69},{"text":"You have quite a detailed blueprint here

the old executive order program and simply to codify that.","start":878.463,"stop":883.751,"duration":5.29},{"text":"On the other hand, it was urged to go much further in the direction the employee

Authority ought to receive any deference because of the principle that in the case of imposition of monetary liability on the federal government the presumption of this Court has always been that one does not read that into the statute absent some expression of congressional intent, but I think even if the Court did determine that there ought to be some deference it is not enough to overcome the indications of that principle and other indications that suggest that Congress did not--","start":911.254,"stop":948.861,"duration":37.61}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Put
