employee's cause of action.","start":628.547,"stop":654.301,"duration":25.75},{"text":"The bottom line is when we read 8131 is that anything you recover is then subject to this federal right of reimbursement.","start":654.301,"stop":663.47,"duration":9.17},{"text":"Now, Respondent has suggested that 8132 is merely an adjunct to Section 8131 which provides that the Secretary may require the employee to assign his right of action to the Secretary to the United States.","start":663.47,"stop":679.712,"duration":16.24},{"text":"In fact, we think the two sections create somewhat different kinds of rights.","start":679.712,"stop":684.975,"duration":5.26},{"text":"But even if you do look to Section 8131 for guidance, we think our interpretation ought to prevail.","start":684.975,"stop":692.504,"duration":7.53},{"text":"The Secretary may require an assignment of the right of action, not just the employee's right to recover for medical expenses and lost wages.","start":692.504,"stop":703.031,"duration":10.53},{"text":"The way assignment would work is that the Secretary, if he received an assignment, would recover any available damages, and that would include not only medical expenses and lost wages, but pain and suffering or punitive damages or anything else the employee himself might recover.","start":703.031,"stop":723.242,"duration":20.21},{"text":"Then at that point the Secretary would take away from the recovery the amount that was necessary to compensate the... the fund for all the FICA benefits that had been paid out.","start":723.242,"stop":734.612,"duration":11.37},{"text":"And only after that if there were some excess left over would that amount be paid to the

really the... the reimbursement of the compensation fund comes first under either 8131 or 8132.","start":741.359,"stop":757.525,"duration":16.17},{"text":"Now, the court skipped over the language of the statute and moved directly to the legislative purposes.","start":757.525,"stop":766.271,"duration":8.75},{"text":"We don't think the court should have dismissed the language so summarily, but

question that the primary purpose of the provisions for third party actions and for reimbursement under FICA are to shift a part of the cost of the program to negligent third party tort feasors; that

particular compensation benefits as opposed to the taxpayers.","start":776.908,"stop":811.269,"duration":34.36},{"text":"Now, various members of Congress expressed concern about the expense of the
