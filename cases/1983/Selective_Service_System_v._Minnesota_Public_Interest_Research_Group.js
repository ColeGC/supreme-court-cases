Lee","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on July 2nd, 1980, President Carter, pursuant to statutory authority, reactivated a draft registration requirement for men between the ages of 18 and 26.","start":12.808,"stop":29.769,"duration":16.96},{"text":"After about two years, almost 7 percent of those eligible still had not complied with the registration requirement, in some cases deliberately, and in some through inadvertence.","start":29.769,"stop":40.641,"duration":10.87},{"text":"In 1982, sponsors in both Houses of Congress introduced as a floor amendment to the 1983 Defense Authorization Act Section 1113, which would condition eligibility for Title 4 college student aid on compliance with the applicant's draft registration obligation.","start":40.641,"stop":61.055,"duration":20.41},{"text":"Much of the language of the amendment, which is sometimes called the Solomon Amendment, was supplied by Secretary Bell, who worked closely with the sponsors in both Houses.","start":61.055,"stop":71.362,"duration":10.31},{"text":"After vigorous debate, it passed both Houses by overwhelming bipartisan majorities.","start":71.362,"stop":77.333,"duration":5.97},{"text":"This case is an appeal from a District Court holding that that 1982 Solomon Amendment violated two constitutional guarantees, the prohibition against bills of attainder contained in Article 1, Section 8, Section 9, and the privilege against compelled self-incrimination.","start":77.333,"stop":96.728,"duration":19.39},{"text":"There are two separate and independently sufficient reasons why the District Court's bill of attainder holding must be reversed.","start":96.728,"stop":105.667,"duration":8.94},{"text":"The first is... this is spelled out more completely in our reply brief... that each of the appellants' contentions rests squarely on their premise that the law does not permit aid to late registrants.","start":105.667,"stop":119.093,"duration":13.43},{"text":"That is, those who register more than 30 days after their 18th birthday.","start":119.093,"stop":122.795,"duration":3.7},{"text":"And the second reason is that even if the Appellees were correct on the late registration issue, this statute still is not a bill of attainder.","start":122.795,"stop":133.584,"duration":10.79},{"text":"I will deal first with the late registration issue.","start":133.584,"stop":135.519,"duration":1.94},{"text":"It is beyond dispute that the Secretary of Education's regulations do provide that those who register late are eligible for aid regardless of when they register.","start":135.519,"stop":147.01,"duration":11.49},{"text":"There is accordingly no question that if the individual appellees in this case comply with their obligation to register, the government will give them the aid that they say they must have.","start":147.01,"stop":160.151,"duration":13.14},{"text":"That is what the regulations provide, and that has been the consistent practice.","start":160.151,"stop":165.372,"duration":5.22},{"text":"In providing that those who register late are eligible, the regulatory scheme in this as is in other respects is faithful to the statutory purpose.","start":165.372,"stop":174.994,"duration":9.62},{"text":"Congress's objective in passing this statute was not to catch wrongdoers and punish them.","start":174.994,"stop":181.917,"duration":6.92},{"text":"It was rather to increase the number of people who are on the draft registration roles by providing both a reminder, because in many cases the reason for non-registration was simple inadvertence, and also an economic incentive.","start":181.917,"stop":195.991,"duration":14.07},{"text":"We turn then to the language of the statute, and there is nothing in that language that prohibits this result which the regulations provide.","start":195.991,"stop":205.449,"duration":9.46},{"text":"The statute requires registration in accordance with any proclamation, rule, or regulation, and the President's proclamation does require registration within 30 days of the registrant's 18th birthday.","start":205.449,"stop":219.757,"duration":14.31},{"text":"The apparent reason for the statutory reference in the Solomon Amendment to rules, regulations, and proclamations is that Section 3 of the Civil Service Act which requires registration is not self-executing and does not come into play until there is some proclamation, rule, or regulation.","start":219.757,"stop":237.051,"duration":17.29},{"text":"But in any event it is far from clear that in accordance with means within the time fixed by.","start":237.051,"stop":245.84,"duration":8.79},{"text":"And another part of the statute, Subsection F(4), which is really the fourth subdivision of the Solomon Amendment, supports the view that in accordance with means in the manner required by rather than within the time fixed by.","start":245.84,"stop":259.934,"duration":14.09},{"text":"In any event, either explanation is plausible.","start":259.934,"stop":263.636,"duration":3.7},{"text":"Certainly neither is implausible, and under those circumstances it is appropriate to consult the statutory purpose, the statutory history in determining the validity of these regulations.","start":263.636,"stop":276.878,"duration":13.24}]},{"speakerName":"William J.

Lee","textObjs":[{"text":"That decision, of course, was made at an earlier point in time, and I guess it was made in 1980, and actually was reflected in President Carter's proclamation, but I would assume that it is simply a readiness statute.","start":491.334,"stop":507.046,"duration":15.71},{"text":"The policymakers of our nation concluded that we are not yet at the stage that we need to move to the draft itself, but just to a readiness position in the event that the draft is necessary.","start":507.046,"stop":517.734,"duration":10.69},{"text":"Even if this statute could be construed to prohibit aid to late registrants, it is still not a bill of attainder.","start":517.734,"stop":528.209,"duration":10.47},{"text":"This Court clarified in Nixon versus the Administrator that to qualify as a bill of attainder a statute must meet each of three tests.","start":528.209,"stop":536.731,"duration":8.52},{"text":"Namely, it must apply only to a specific individual or group.","start":536.731,"stop":541.2,"duration":4.47},{"text":"Second, it must inflict punishment.","start":541.2,"stop":544.485,"duration":3.28},{"text":"And third, it must deny judicial process.","start":544.485,"stop":547.254,"duration":2.77},{"text":"This statute does not one of those three things.","start":547.254,"stop":550.99,"duration":3.74},{"text":"First, the Solomon Amendment simply is not punitive within the bill of attainder sense of that word.","start":550.99,"stop":560.946,"duration":9.96},{"text":"At common law, bills of attainder were legislative death sentences, usually for treason, but it is clear that Article 1, Section 9, also includes common law bills of pains and penalties, which included such penalties as imprisonment, banishment, and confiscation of property, and as the Court pointed out in Nixon versus Administrator, our own American experience has added one other category, and that is disqualification from certain kinds of employment because of a legislative determination of past wrongdoing by particular individuals or groups.","start":560.946,"stop":598.055,"duration":37.11},{"text":"But punishment for bill of attainder purposes clearly does not extend to any circumstance of non-realization of an economic benefit which any individual would like to have, and the square holding of Fleming versus Nestor is that the mere denial, in Fleming's words, the mere denial of a non-contractual governmental benefit does not amount to punishment for bill of attainder purposes, and that is all we have here, the mere denial of a non-contractual governmental benefit.","start":598.055,"stop":632.776,"duration":34.72},{"text":"If it was not punishment to deprive Mr. Nestor of his Social Security benefits after he had paid into the fund for 19 years, then a fortiori it is not punishment to condition student aid to registration with the draft.","start":632.776,"stop":655.475,"duration":22.7}]},{"speakerName":"William J. Brennan, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Do we know, Mr. Solicitor General, how many of that 350 to 380,000 who have not registered are receiving financial aid?","start":655.475,"stop":664.664,"duration":9.19}]},{"speakerName":"Rex E.

information.","start":667.75,"stop":671.585,"duration":3.84},{"text":"I turn now to the other two elements of bill of attainder.","start":671.585,"stop":675.805,"duration":4.22},{"text":"With regard to specificity, this law applies to non-registrants.","start":675.805,"stop":682.892,"duration":7.09},{"text":"It is the complete antithesis, the complete opposite end of the spectrum from the specific identification that we experienced at common law or any other instance in which any statute has ever been held unconstitutional as a bill of attainder.","start":682.892,"stop":703.373,"duration":20.48},{"text":"It is an open-ended group whose fluctuating membership will be determined by events which are yet to occur in the future, and that argument does not depend on our position with regard to late registration, because even if we are wrong on late registration, the class affected is nonetheless one that changes every day and whose composition is constantly subject to future contingencies as more young men turn 18 and either register or neglect or decline to register.","start":703.373,"stop":736.879,"duration":33.51},{"text":"And as I stated a moment ago, never in the history of our Republic has any statute ever been held unconstitutional as a bill of attainder where its membership depended upon events which might yet occur in the future.","start":736.879,"stop":751.972,"duration":15.09},{"text":"With regard to denial of judicial process, the only relevant issue or determination through the judicial type process, whether the individual does or does not fall within the legislative target area, is whether the individual has registered.","start":751.972,"stop":770.35,"duration":18.38},{"text":"It is therefore completely unlike the circumstance in United States versus Brown, in which the issue was whether communism was an adequate proxy for... to engage in political strikes.","start":770.35,"stop":784.693,"duration":14.34},{"text":"And since this statute and these regulations do provide for the individual who wants to show that in fact he has registered, this characteristic, this factor also has been satisfied.","start":784.693,"stop":799.452,"duration":14.76},{"text":"I turn finally to the appellees' privilege against self-incrimination argument.","start":799.452,"stop":805.273,"duration":5.82},{"text":"There are three short reasons why this is not a violation of the Fifth Amendment.","start":805.273,"stop":812.944,"duration":7.67},{"text":"The first is that there is no compulsion.","start":812.944,"stop":815.296,"duration":2.35},{"text":"There is no compulsion in prescribing standards of eligibility for student aid.","start":815.296,"stop":820.616,"duration":5.32},{"text":"Indeed, non-registrants are not only not compelled to apply for student aid.","start":820.616,"stop":826.52,"duration":5.9},{"text":"It would be useless for them to do so because they are ineligible, and it is not a crime not to apply for student aid.","start":826.52,"stop":834.975,"duration":8.46},{"text":"Moreover, the privilege against self-incrimination does not assure that there will be no adverse economic consequences from remaining silent.","start":834.975,"stop":842.963,"duration":7.99},{"text":"The Garrity, Spevack, Gardner, Lefkowitz line of cases on which the appellees rely stand for the proposition that government may not compel self-incrimination, may not compel self-incriminating testimony without a grant of immunity.","start":842.963,"stop":859.241,"duration":16.28},{"text":"They do not stand for the proposition, as this Court made very clear in the Gardner case, that nothing that the person says or doesn't say can ever be used to his economic advantage, or disadvantage.","start":859.241,"stop":872.751,"duration":13.51},{"text":"Surely, for example, the Drug Enforcement Administration is entitled to ask a job applicant whether he uses drugs.","start":872.751,"stop":879.571,"duration":6.82},{"text":"Surely in employing lawyers from my office we are entitled to ask whether the applicant has ever stolen money from a client.","start":879.571,"stop":888.094,"duration":8.52},{"text":"Surely the Department of Agriculture is entitled to ask an applicant for federal crop insurance whether he is growing marijuana on his farm.","start":888.094,"stop":896.366,"duration":8.27},{"text":"And in the administration of Title 4 itself, surely the Department of Education can ask whether the applicant is legally in this country, because that is one of the qualifications for student aid.","start":896.366,"stop":909.091,"duration":12.73},{"text":"Third, there is an element of unreality about the appellees' Fifth Amendment argument.","start":909.091,"stop":916.863,"duration":7.77},{"text":"The purpose of this statute after all is to get people registered.","start":916.863,"stop":921.231,"duration":4.37},{"text":"A major objective, a major theme in the legislative history is that those people who had not registered on time should register late, and that was a major purpose of this statute, to get those who had not registered on time to register late.","start":921.231,"stop":934.825,"duration":13.59},{"text":"It would be a perversion of that purpose to prosecute late registrants, to prosecute for doing the very thing that the statute was passed to encourage, and it has never been done.","start":934.825,"stop":946.383,"duration":11.56},{"text":"This Court said in Marketti that the central standard for the privileges application has been whether the claimant is confronted by substantial and real as opposed to mere trifling or imaginary hazards of incrimination.","start":946.383,"stop":958.856,"duration":12.47},{"text":"I cannot imagine any hazards of incrimination that more appropriately fit that definition, trifling and imaginary.","start":958.856,"stop":967.046,"duration":8.19},{"text":"One person of the presumably tens of thousands, probably even hundreds of thousands, who have registered late thus far has been prosecuted, and that is firmly opposed to government policy.","start":967.046,"stop":977.585,"duration":10.54},{"text":"One final note, and on this I will close.","start":977.585,"stop":981.806,"duration":4.22},{"text":"It probably is not... it may not be independently dispositive, but at the very least there is an additional consideration

Amendment.","start":981.806,"stop":1003.552,"duration":21.75},{"text":"Last term, in Regan versus Taxation With Representation, this Court held that Congress is entitled to great deference in making
