cases, the fraud consisted of diverting business receivables into the secret bank accounts maintained on behalf of the company's employees.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Now, the

merely because that data happens to be contained in the vehicle of an amended return.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In short, our view is that the Commissioner's need for an unlimited period of assessment in fraud cases is not materially diminished by the filing of an amended return.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And, we think there is no reason to hold that amended returns of all the manifold documents and data that might bear on tax fraud has the unique effect, the singular effect, of shortening to three years the unlimited period that governs fraud cases generally.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"We think there is a second and discreet reason for holding on grounds of tax policy, that the three-year rule should not come into play in tax fraud cases.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This has to do with the Commissioner's duty to pursue criminal tax enforcement.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"As this Court has noted in the past, Congress has charged the Commissioner with pursuing both criminal and civil aspects in tax fraud.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Limitations period for prosecuting criminal tax fraud is not three but six years.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"As a result, it will often be impossible on a practical ground and unwise as a matter of efficient and sound tax administration for the Commissioner to close down his civil audit within three years of getting an amended return on the taxpayer.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The practical problems here we think are fairly evident.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Once the Commissioner makes a referral to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, he loses his primary audit tool; that is his power to summons the books, records, and testimony of the taxpayers and third parties.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This result is required by LaSalle Bank, from this Court, and by Congress' later amendment of Code Section 7602.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But, that means, having lost the summons power, the Commissioner must in effect close down or suspend the civil audit because he has no way of getting information from the taxpayer.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"But, apart from these practical problems, the Commissioner has long had a policy of suspending civil audit pending the completion of criminal proceedings.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"This policy is set forth in the Internal Revenue Manual and it stems from the difficulty of conducting at the same time a civil tax fraud litigation while a criminal tax fraud investigation is continuing.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And, the most obvious problem, of course, is the risk of killing the criminal case by making a premature disclosure of evidence to the potential defendant.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"If the three-year rule is held to apply here, the Commissioner, right in the middle of his criminal tax fraud investigation, is going to have to send a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer asserting civil tax fraud.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"The taxpayer will then go into Tax Court or the District Court and the Commissioner will be required by the rules of those Courts to allege fraud affirmatively in the answer and then be subject to discovery, interrogatories and depositions, about his fraud theory.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"I think it is pretty clear that if the Commissioner is required to open up his files right in the middle of the on-going criminal investigation, laying out his theory of fraud and the fact he expects to rely on in proving fraud, that criminal case could probably be killed.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Beyond that, we think there are other problems in maintaining an on-going criminal investigation and a parallel civil tax fraud litigation.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"In the civil case, the taxpayer, for example, will probably assert the Fifth Amendment privilege barring any introduction of evidence on the issue of fraud.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"There could be problems with witnesses because of the premature disclosure of their names through potential defendant and finally there can be problems where the taxpayer puts up a defense as a beleaguered defendant in a criminal action asserting the Commissioner is trying to dun him on five different fronts at once, grab his money, and juries occasionally have been persuaded by that kind of evidence.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"So, for all these reasons, we think that the Commissioner's policy of suspending civil tax audit until the completion of criminal proceedings is salutary both on grounds of fairness to the taxpayer and on grounds of sensible administration of the tax laws.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"Petitioners' argument here would effectively kill that policy.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And, finally, we think there is one last reason for tax policy that counsels in favor of a plain reading of the Code here.","start":0,"stop":0,"duration":0},{"text":"And this has to do with the Commissioner's overall duties to enforce the
