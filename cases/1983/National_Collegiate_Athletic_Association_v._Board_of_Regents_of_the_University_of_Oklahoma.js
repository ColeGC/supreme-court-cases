case.","start":279.731,"stop":285.135,"duration":5.4},{"text":"The Solicitor General joins us in arguing that the per se rule is inapplicable here because the NCAA's arrangements are potentially pro-competitive.","start":285.135,"stop":294.657,"duration":9.52},{"text":"The Solicitor General then calls for a novel intermediate tier of scrutiny under which the Court takes a quick look at the practices in context.","start":294.657,"stop":304.465,"duration":9.81},{"text":"We are perfectly willing to agree with the Solicitor General's approach, but only if the quick look starts with a look at market power.","start":304.465,"stop":311.802,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Market power is essential in our view because otherwise the courts end up condemning whatever they do not fully understand.","start":311.802,"stop":320.908,"duration":9.11},{"text":"Here the lower courts didn't reject our justifications for this conduct so much as to say that they were not persuaded, that the NCAA's contentions were too speculative, too open-ended, too uncertain to show the necessity of this plan.","start":320.908,"stop":338.12,"duration":17.21},{"text":"Now, we think it's natural for a judge who's a novice in both economics and the football business to be hesitant about embracing a novel explanation for why the NCAA has done what it's done.","start":338.12,"stop":350.51,"duration":12.39},{"text":"But antitrust is not opposed to all complicated practices just because it's hard to understand them or hard to articulate why those practices are carried out.","start":350.51,"stop":361.818,"duration":11.31},{"text":"After all, if they're banned that kind of proof will never be available.","start":361.818,"stop":365.67,"duration":3.85},{"text":"The market power test for which we argue is we think an absolutely essential filter.","start":365.67,"stop":371.574,"duration":5.9},{"text":"If there's no market power the practices can't be anticompetitive, and indeed it's precisely the case when there is no market power that cooperative practices are likely to be most useful as instruments of competition.","start":371.574,"stop":385.251,"duration":13.68},{"text":"We think that when a court says that it doesn't really know why a business practice was undertaken, the court should be very slow to hold that business practice unlawful if there is no market power, and that it's appropriate to put the plaintiff to one of two burdens.","start":385.251,"stop":404.145,"duration":18.89},{"text":"On the one hand, the plaintiff could show that the practices are never beneficial, and in that event the per se rule applies and market power is irrelevant.","start":404.145,"stop":413.27,"duration":9.13},{"text":"But if the practices have potentially pro-competitive effects, the rule of reason should apply and market power should be the initial test before a court can hold those practices unlawful.","start":413.27,"stop":424.642,"duration":11.37},{"text":"Let me then summarize our argument on market power.","start":424.642,"stop":428.779,"duration":4.14},{"text":"It's this: Market power under this Court's cases is the ability to raise price by reducing output.","start":428.779,"stop":435.849,"duration":7.07},{"text":"That is, we want to know if the defendant has the ability to charge a monopoly price.","start":435.849,"stop":441.337,"duration":5.49},{"text":"If it can't, there's no antitrust reason to be concerned about its practices.","start":441.337,"stop":447.074,"duration":5.74},{"text":"And there is no way the NCAA can charge a monopoly price by reducing the number of different games that appear on TV.","start":447.074,"stop":455.947,"duration":8.87},{"text":"The television industry sells viewers to advertisers.","start":455.947,"stop":462.334,"duration":6.39},{"text":"That is the central commercial transaction.","start":462.334,"stop":465.286,"duration":2.95},{"text":"The only people who put money into this system are the advertisers, and the only people who can be held up for more money are therefore the advertisers.","start":465.286,"stop":475.593,"duration":10.31},{"text":"It is undisputed on this record that advertisers pay only for viewers actually delivered.","start":475.593,"stop":482.914,"duration":7.32},{"text":"They are buying audience.","start":482.914,"stop":485.116,"duration":2.2},{"text":"The TV networks pay the suppliers of programs
