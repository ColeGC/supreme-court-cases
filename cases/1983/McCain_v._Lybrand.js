first.","start":813.823,"stop":815.816,"duration":1.99},{"text":"In the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Congress was concerned not only with eliminating existing forms of voting discrimination, but also with preventing any form of discrimination local jurisdiction might devise in the future.","start":815.816,"stop":829.174,"duration":13.36},{"text":"The method Congress choose to protect against new forms of discriminations was to require each covered jurisdiction, before implementing any voting change, to submit it for scrutiny by an independent body.","start":829.174,"stop":842.163,"duration":12.99},{"text":"Congress selected the District Court for the District of Columbia and the Attorney General to conduct this independent scrutiny.","start":842.163,"stop":849.837,"duration":7.67},{"text":"This right of minority voters to be free from voting changes that have not been found to be nondiscriminatory can only be ensured if the reviewing bodies' attention is, in fact, brought to bear on the precise change in question.","start":849.837,"stop":863.818,"duration":13.98},{"text":"When preclearance is sought in the District Court, that focus is assured by the requirement that the jurisdiction file a complaint specifying the changes it wishes to have precleared.","start":863.818,"stop":874.083,"duration":10.26},{"text":"Similarly, this Court has held that when a jurisdiction seeks preclearance by the Attorney General, the statute requires the jurisdiction to state unambiguously the changes it seeks to have approved.","start":874.083,"stop":886.391,"duration":12.31},{"text":"When a jurisdiction fails to carry that burden, preclearance cannot be based on a determination that the Attorney General should have known that the change required preclearance.","start":886.391,"stop":896.867,"duration":10.48},{"text":"Such a result defeats the right afforded by Section 5 which is the right to actual scrutiny of voting changes before they are limited.","start":896.867,"stop":905.052,"duration":8.19},{"text":"Such a result also inures who the intended beneficiaries of the Voting Rights Act are.","start":905.052,"stop":910.815,"duration":5.76},{"text":"Section 5 was not intended to benefit the Attorney General or the local jurisdiction, but rather minority voters are the intended beneficiaries of Section 5.","start":910.815,"stop":920.132,"duration":9.32},{"text":"Accordingly, this is not a contest between Edgefield County and the Attorney General in which the county's failure to make an unambiguous submission can be excused by some purported contributory negligence of the Attorney General.","start":920.132,"stop":933.683,"duration":13.55},{"text":"For reasons I shall state, we dispute that the Attorney General was negligent in his preclearance of the 1971 submission.","start":933.683,"stop":940.706,"duration":7.02},{"text":"But, in any event, his role under the statute is not an adversarial one, but more of a judicial one.","start":940.706,"stop":947.772,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Hence, in the absence of statutory compliance by the jurisdiction, any alleged fault by the Attorney General cannot be attributed to the intended beneficiaries of the Act so as to defeat their rights.","start":947.772,"stop":960.45,"duration":12.68},{"text":"The requirement that a jurisdiction state unambiguously the changes it wishes to have precleared is entirely consistent with the Section 5 scheme.","start":960.45,"stop":969.866,"duration":9.42},{"text":"That provision requires the voluntary submission of voting changes by covered jurisdictions and places on them the burden of proving absence of discriminatory purpose or effect.","start":969.866,"stop":980.735,"duration":10.87},{"text":"This Court has recognized that the Attorney General simply does not have the resources to police all the states and subdivisions covered by the Act.","start":980.735,"stop":987.988,"duration":7.25},{"text":"He receives thousands of Section 5 submissions each year and the statute affords him only 60 days in which to act on them.","start":987.988,"stop":995.615,"duration":7.63},{"text":"Moreover, as this Court has also emphasized, the Attorney General cannot be charged with knowledge of all the nuances of local law.","start":995.615,"stop":1002.829,"duration":7.21},{"text":"By contrast, the submitting jurisdiction knows exactly which changes it wants to clear and it is not too much to expect that it state those changes clearly so the Attorney General will be sure to focus on them and, thus, bring to bear the scrutiny that minority voters are entitled to under the Act.","start":1002.829,"stop":1021.02,"duration":18.19},{"text":"Here, it cannot be seriously claimed that Appellees or South Carolina ever made an unambiguous request for preclearance of the change to at-large election.","start":1021.02,"stop":1030.487,"duration":9.47},{"text":"The court below found as a fact that South Carolina did not submit the change before it was implemented in 1966 and it is strange credulity to suggest that the 1971 submission was an unambiguous request for approval of the prior change.","start":1030.487,"stop":1047.788,"duration":17.3},{"text":"The only changes brought about by the '71 legislation, as Mr. McDonald said, which would redistrict Edgefield County into five

never indicated there were any other voting changes subject to the preclearance requirement, much less requested preclearance of them.","start":1061.065,"stop":1072.475,"duration":11.41},{"text":"The court below relied on the fact that the 1971 legislation contained a provision for at-large elections, but the Attorney General knew from the face of the '66 statute that the at-large provision was not new in '71.","start":1072.475,"stop":1088.525,"duration":16.05},{"text":"Appellees contend that the Attorney General also should have known from the face of the 1966 statute that the at-large provision was first enacted in that year and, thus, was a change requiring preclearance.","start":1088.525,"stop":1102.983,"duration":14.46},{"text":"But, the Attorney General did not know from the 1966 statute that its provision for at-large elections was not a mere codification of prior law as was the identical 1971 provision and, in any event, what the Attorney General perhaps should have known or should have inquired into is irrelevant.","start":1102.983,"stop":1123.978,"duration":21},{"text":"The right guaranteed minority voters under Section 5 is actual scrutiny of voting changes before they are put into effect.","start":1123.978,"stop":1131.662,"duration":7.68},{"text":"Of course, if the Attorney General, in fact, had considered a particular change, regardless of whether he had been unambiguously requested to do so, Section 5 interests would have been protected, but that is not what happened here.","start":1131.662,"stop":1145.401,"duration":13.74},{"text":"The only

the initial change from a combined appointed, elected council to a council entirely elected at large, he would have needed the pre-1966 information.","start":1154.768,"stop":1166.737,"duration":11.97},{"text":"Accordingly, if the Attorney General considered the at-large feature at all, he did so only in the context of comparing an
