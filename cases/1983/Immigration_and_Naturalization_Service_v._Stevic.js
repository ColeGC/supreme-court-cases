refugees.","start":521.626,"stop":527.018,"duration":5.39},{"text":"One was the United States' accession in 1968 to the United Nations protocol related to refugees, and the other was the passage in 1980 of the Refugee Act.","start":527.018,"stop":539.136,"duration":12.12},{"text":"It is the government's position that neither of the statutory changes was intended in any way to alter the substantive standard applied to Section 243(h) relief, so that if the standard was correct, as we take everyone to agree it was prior to 1968, it is still the correct standard today because each time Congress has revisited this area of the law, although it has changed some of the terminology, it has gone on record as saying it didn't intend to make any substantive change in the standard that the

be persecuted.","start":637.599,"stop":655.652,"duration":18.05},{"text":"We don't think that Congress intended either change when it adhered to the protocol, even though the protocol had that

substantive change in the law.","start":655.652,"stop":674.424,"duration":18.77},{"text":"Now, as I was saying, the Senate was explicitly told this by everyone who testified on the protocol in

fact, there were in fact two provisions of the protocol that could have been taken to have an adverse impact upon our domestic laws.","start":723.586,"stop":732.334,"duration":8.75},{"text":"One related to the taxation of nonresident aliens; the other related to the receipt of Social Security benefits.","start":732.334,"stop":738.306,"duration":5.97},{"text":"The Senate explicitly reserved as to those two provisions.","start":738.306,"stop":743.56,"duration":5.25},{"text":"Its accession did not cover those two provisions, so there should be no doubt that the protocol would not change our domestic laws in any way.","start":743.56,"stop":750.684,"duration":7.12},{"text":"And in fact, as we quote in footnote 28, after those reservations, Senator Proxmire assured is colleagues that with the reservations included, this removes even the slightest possible conflict between federal law and the provisions of the protocol.","start":750.684,"stop":766.805,"duration":16.12},{"text":"All of the representations made to the Senate in 1968 indicated that our immigration laws already included the human provisions of the protocol, and perhaps the best evidence of this, the fact that Congress thought it was simply making a symbolic gesture when it adhered to the protocol, was that there was absolutely no opposition to the protocol.","start":766.805,"stop":788.888,"duration":22.08},{"text":"There were virtually no hearings on the protocol, and it passed the Senate unanimously.","start":788.888,"stop":793.612,"duration":4.72},{"text":"We think it was therefore common ground in 1968 that the phrase \"well-founded fear of persecution\", which appears in the

applying.","start":793.612,"stop":815.747,"duration":22.13},{"text":"And in fact, this understanding was completely borne out, if there could have been any doubt in 1968 itself, this understanding that the phrase was exactly the same was borne out by the administrative practice over the next 12 years because no court, after accession to the protocol in 1968, held that the substantive standard
