Wainwright.","start":65.442,"stop":83.967,"duration":18.53},{"text":"In urging reversal of the Ninth Circuit, below we submit four propositions this morning.","start":83.967,"stop":90.058,"duration":6.09},{"text":"First is that public defender immunity from Section 1983 conspiracy claims is, in fact, necessary to protect against destructive suits which themselves threaten the integrity and finality of the judicial process itself.","start":90.058,"stop":103.739,"duration":13.68},{"text":"Second, that public defender immunity is necessary to protect the institution of public defender as one of the most effective methods of meeting Sixth Amendment mandates.","start":103.739,"stop":115.033,"duration":11.29},{"text":"Our third contention and proposition is that public defender immunity, in fact, best serves the interests of indigent clients.","start":115.033,"stop":122.139,"duration":7.11},{"text":"And, finally, we submit to the Court that there exist alternative remedies for those few abuses which might exist which amply justify the grant of absolute immunity.","start":122.139,"stop":130.494,"duration":8.36},{"text":"The facts giving rise to this case are simple and have been exhaustively reviewed in the briefs of counsel.","start":130.494,"stop":136.992,"duration":6.5},{"text":"We note simply that respondent Glover, a convicted burglar brought a pro se 1983 claim against his state and county public defenders.","start":136.992,"stop":146.473,"duration":9.48}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.
