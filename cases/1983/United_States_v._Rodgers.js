determinations.","start":181.177,"stop":198.233,"duration":17.06},{"text":"As both the Second and the Fifth Circuits have already recognized, there is absolutely no basis for the Eighth Circuit's restrictive construction of this statute.","start":198.233,"stop":208.151,"duration":9.92},{"text":"This Court has noted on several occasions that Congress spoke in broad language in Section 1001,

representations.","start":208.151,"stop":227.658,"duration":19.51},{"text":"And the Court has specifically counseled against narrowing this broad language by construction.","start":227.658,"stop":232.969,"duration":5.31},{"text":"In particular, there is no indication that the word \"jurisdiction\" was intended to distinguish among the nature of governmental functions.","start":232.969,"stop":241.216,"duration":8.25},{"text":"In United States against Gilliland, the Court explained that the purpose of Section 1001 is to protect the authorized

body.","start":251.914,"stop":269.063,"duration":17.15},{"text":"This construction follows naturally from the fact that the statute encompasses any department or agency of the United States, without

statutory language, the Eighth Circuit's construction would virtually leave the FBI and the Secret Service out of the protection of the

construction we urge will have a chilling effect on the citizenry's willingness to report suspected criminal activity to law enforcement authorities.","start":560.308,"stop":574.755,"duration":14.45},{"text":"But the terms of the statute themselves preclude any undue chilling effect, since only false statements that are willfully and

false.","start":584.095,"stop":591.03,"duration":6.93},{"text":"Finally, in the alternative, Respondent argues that even if the Court agrees with our construction of the statute, that decision should not be applied in his case because at the time he made the false reports his conduct was not criminal under the law prevailing in the Eighth Circuit, that is, under the Friedman decision.","start":591.03,"stop":614.177,"duration":23.15},{"text":"But there's no due process obstacles to applying a ruling in favor of the government to the Respondent in this case.","start":614.177,"stop":621.923,"duration":7.75},{"text":"In the first place, because Section 1001 contains a willfullness requirement there's no danger that Respondent would be convicted in the absence of proof that he knew that the acts he committed were wrongful.","start":621.923,"stop":634.575,"duration":12.65},{"text":"Accordingly, the question whether the existence of the Friedman precedent in the Eighth Circuit precludes Respondent's conviction is one for the finder of fact in the determination of willfulness in the first instance.","start":634.575,"stop":647.32,"duration":12.75},{"text":"But Respondent also appears to be making a larger argument based on notions of due process vagueness and notice, that the mere existence of a precedent in his circuit holding Section 1001 inapplicable to conduct analogous to his precludes his conviction as a matter of law.","start":647.32,"stop":668.234,"duration":20.91},{"text":"But Respondent's argument would convert every arguable question of statutory construction into a constitutional vagueness issue.","start":668.234,"stop":677.449,"duration":9.21},{"text":"Respondent has never argued that the words of Section 1001 themselves are so vague as to fail to give notice of the prohibited conduct, as in Connelly versus General Construction Company.","start":677.449,"stop":690.038,"duration":12.59},{"text":"Nor is this a case like Bouie versus City of Columbia, on which Respondent does rely, because there the statute on its face gave no indication that it covered the defendant's conduct, nor had it ever been construed as covering such conduct.","start":690.038,"stop":704.907,"duration":14.87},{"text":"By contrast, Respondent's retroactivity argument assumes a ruling for the government on the substantive issue, and that ruling would be based on the fact that the plain language of the statute does cover his conduct.","start":704.907,"stop":719.901,"duration":14.99},{"text":"Respondent is thus reduced to arguing that whenever courts differ over the meaning of a statute the legislation is as a matter of law unconstitutionally vague.","start":719.901,"stop":730.959,"duration":11.06},{"text":"But that cannot be.","start":730.959,"stop":732.957,"duration":2},{"text":"If it were, the government would never be able to seek this court's review of an issue of statutory construction on which the courts of appeals were divided, because we would be asking for an advisory opinion.","start":732.957,"stop":744.546,"duration":11.59},{"text":"And likewise, this Court would be precluded from affirming a conviction in the face of a conflict among the circuits concerning the interpretation of a statute.","start":744.546,"stop":752.699,"duration":8.15},{"text":"Yet the Court does so regularly.","start":752.699,"stop":755.027,"duration":2.33},{"text":"Vagueness must rest on something more than a difference of opinion among courts and judges, and Respondent has alleged nothing more and there is nothing more in this case.","start":755.027,"stop":765.913,"duration":10.89},{"text":"Finally, application of a ruling in favor of the government to Respondent here is consistent with the opinion rendered in James versus United States.","start":765.913,"stop":776.473,"duration":10.56},{"text":"In James, this Court held that embezzled funds are taxable income of the embezzler, thus overruling the prior decision in Wilcox versus United States.","start":776.473,"stop":786.529,"duration":10.06},{"text":"James' conviction for willful evasion of taxes nevertheless was reversed because three Justices believed that the new construction should not be applied to him, while three other Justices would not have overruled Wilcox.","start":786.529,"stop":800.508,"duration":13.98},{"text":"But, significantly, a total of five Justices were of the view that if a new rule were to be adopted it should be applied to James, at least absent a showing of bona fide reliance by him on the prior construction.","start":800.508,"stop":815.424,"duration":14.92},{"text":"Indeed, even the view of the plurality in James is distinguishable from the present case, since James involved the overruling of a prior decision of this Court.","start":815.424,"stop":825.654,"duration":10.23},{"text":"The willfullness requirement of Section 1001 assures that Respondent will not be convicted on the basis of conduct that he did not know was wrongful.","start":825.654,"stop":836.478,"duration":10.82},{"text":"At least in the conduct of this case, due process requires no more.","start":836.478,"stop":841.632,"duration":5.15},{"text":"The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and the case should be remanded for
