504.","start":430.473,"stop":452.069,"duration":21.6},{"text":"We believe that the legislative history of Section 601 itself, without even looking at Section 604 of the Act, supports an inference that

employment.","start":452.069,"stop":480.476,"duration":28.41},{"text":"Whatever ambiguity may have existed in the language of Section 601 as it was originally proposed was rectified when Congress passed Section 604 of the Act, which clearly prohibited or clearly limited the use of Section 601 for employment discrimination, and with respect to Section 604 and Section 601, there is some legislative history, and the legislative history supports a limiting interpretation of Section 601 and 604.","start":480.476,"stop":517.311,"duration":36.84},{"text":"Now, in the North Haven case, dealing with the third statute, that has language similar to Section 504 and Section 601, this Court considered whether or not Title 9 of the Education Act amendments apply broadly to all programs receiving federal assistance with respect to employment discrimination on the basis of handicap, or conversely, whether it applied narrowly only when the primary objective of the program for assistance was to provide employment, and they opted for the latter interpretation of the statute, and the North Haven decision was important, if not instrumental in the decision of the court of appeals in this case.","start":517.311,"stop":565.033,"duration":47.72},{"text":"We believe that Title 9 and the North Haven decision is inapposite for several reasons, the first of which is that Title 9 has its own enforcement procedures.","start":565.033,"stop":576.851,"duration":11.82},{"text":"It did not incorporate Title 6.","start":576.851,"stop":580.364,"duration":3.51},{"text":"The enforcement procedures set out in Title 9 do not include an analogue to Section 604.","start":580.364,"stop":586.856,"duration":6.49},{"text":"Secondly, during the legislative consideration of Title 9 amendments, a provision identical or similar, significantly identical to Section 604 was offered and proposed in Congress and was rejected by Congress during the conference on the legislation, so thus the court in North Haven looked to the rejection of Section 604 as an indication of a legislative intent to construe the Title 9 more broadly than Title 6 had been construed.","start":586.856,"stop":625.251,"duration":38.39},{"text":"And finally, there was positive legislative history identified in the Court's opinion in North Haven evidencing an intention to construe that statute more broadly than Title 9.","start":625.251,"stop":636.508,"duration":11.26},{"text":"In contrast, with respect to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title 6 does not... is specifically incorporated in Section 504.","start":636.508,"stop":652.51,"duration":16},{"text":"There is no evidence that Congress intended or attempted to exclude Section 604 from the rights, remedies, and procedures of Title 6 that were incorporated into Section 504 as an enforcement mechanism, and there is no legislative history that suggests that Section 604 was not intended to be applied to actions under Section 504.","start":652.51,"stop":680.168,"duration":27.66},{"text":"We believe that Section 504 was intended to focus on the intended beneficiaries of the federal assistance, and in the context of allegations of work place discrimination, the intended beneficiaries of federal assistance exist only when the primary objective of the federal assistance is to provide employment, and this is even more so the case under Section 504 than under Title 6 and Title 9.","start":680.168,"stop":719.542,"duration":39.37},{"text":"The primary objectives of Title 6 and Title 9 are to require the employer to present from considering an applicant or an employee's race, sex, national origin, or color in making employment-related decisions.","start":719.542,"stop":736.754,"duration":17.21},{"text":"If an employer acts on the basis of an employee's or an applicant's race or sex, the employer should know that he is either on shaky ground or he may be violating the Act.","start":736.754,"stop":750.965,"duration":14.21},{"text":"On the other hand, with respect to handicapped discrimination, allegations of handicapped discrimination, when an employer considers an application or a personnel action relating to a handicapped employee, he is almost always forced, or she is almost always forced to focus on the handicap, the nature of the handicap, because the statute itself requires the protections of the Act to handicapped persons who are otherwise qualified for employment.","start":750.965,"stop":788.478,"duration":37.51},{"text":"So, in practice, when an employer considers, as in the case of Mr. LeStrange, whether Mr. LeStrange is qualified to be a yard

arm.","start":788.478,"stop":814.435,"duration":25.96},{"text":"Rather, he is being asked to consider whether that handicap itself disqualifies Mr. LeStrange from employment on ConRail.","start":814.435,"stop":828.394,"duration":13.96},{"text":"And I believe that that distinction between the Acts buttresses an... a narrowing interpretation of Section 504 that would direct the statute to the program that is being considered, and in the context of employment discrimination, the program has to be related to employment.","start":828.394,"stop":853.16,"duration":24.77},{"text":"Otherwise, Section 504 assumes a range of remedial legislation, and it is our position that Congress did not intend to enact remedial legislation when it passed Section 504.","start":853.16,"stop":870.021,"duration":16.86},{"text":"If one examines the
