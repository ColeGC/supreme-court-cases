sections of the Federal Arbitration Act speak to what the United States courts should do if proceedings relating to arbitration are brought in the United States courts.","start":606.645,"stop":623.56,"duration":16.91},{"text":"However, Section 2 of the federal statute specifically says without limiting the protection of the statute to any particular courts

contract.","start":623.56,"stop":652.377,"duration":28.82},{"text":"What Congress did in this section was to broadly declare that these contracts shall be upheld and they shall be enforced except on grounds that apply to any contract such as waiver or duress in a particular case.","start":652.377,"stop":673.056,"duration":20.68},{"text":"But if a contract satisfies those general doctrines of contract formation, Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act says that that contract must be enforced.","start":673.056,"stop":686.957,"duration":13.9},{"text":"I think also that if Section 2 were read otherwise very unfortunate results would occur because the enforceability of an arbitration agreement in interstate commerce would depend on the forum in which enforcement was

facts.","start":769.159,"stop":776.297,"duration":7.14},{"text":"The common law fraud claim is clearly arbitrable and the statutory claim is indistinguishable in terms of its elements, in terms of its basic nature from the common law claim.","start":776.297,"stop":792.446,"duration":16.15},{"text":"Yet what the Appellees are arguing in this case is that if the legislature of California chooses to say that you cannot arbitrate this kind of claim then what would otherwise be valid and enforceable under the federal statute ceases to become so.","start":792.446,"stop":812.641,"duration":20.19},{"text":"The Plaintiffs' argument on this issue really boils down to stating that Congress has occasionally adopted exceptions to the Federal Arbitration Act when it has passed various types of federal legislation so why should the states not be free to do so.","start":812.641,"stop":834.912,"duration":22.27},{"text":"Well the answer to that is simply that the Supremacy Clause applies to the states and it does not control what Congress can do.","start":834.912,"stop":844.159,"duration":9.25},{"text":"What Congress gives it can take away, but the states cannot take away what Congress has made valid and enforceable in a federal statute.","start":844.159,"stop":852.765,"duration":8.61},{"text":"There are obvious policy differences as well between exceptions to a protective federal statute like this where the exceptions are created by Congress and the states.","start":852.765,"stop":867.291,"duration":14.53},{"text":"Congress when it is considering adopting an exception can carefully balance the different considerations and can keep the scope of the exceptions within very narrow limits, but when each of 50 individual states are permitted to adopt exceptions the scope of those exceptions will become virtually uncontrolled.","start":867.291,"stop":891.937,"duration":24.65},{"text":"The other important difference from a policy point of view is that any exceptions adopted by Congress will apply uniformly throughout the United States and parties that enter into arbitration agreements will be able to predict whether those agreements are going to be enforced or not with respect to particular kinds of claims.","start":891.937,"stop":915.864,"duration":23.93},{"text":"But if each state can decide for itself when these agreements are going to be enforced and when they are not that predictability would be lost.","start":915.864,"stop":926.907,"duration":11.04},{"text":"The Plaintiffs' position in this case or rather I should say the California legislation in this case as interpreted by the State Supreme Court reflects we think a basic mistrust for arbitration.","start":926.907,"stop":947.212,"duration":20.3},{"text":"The underlying notion of their argument seems to be that arbitration is somehow going to be a vehicle that is going to allow the party with the superior resources to defeat small claims.","start":947.212,"stop":961.08,"duration":13.87},{"text":"I think that that basic premise is one that has to be challenged, that arbitration is beneficial for everybody but particularly beneficial when small claims and people with limited resources are involved.","start":961.08,"stop":980.026,"duration":18.95},{"text":"The party with the superior resources can often litigate cases to death, can take full advantage of discovery rules, string out the case forever and frustrate small claims.","start":980.026,"stop":994.019,"duration":13.99},{"text":"But if a party is free to bring a case in arbitration he can get it tried promptly.","start":994.019,"stop":1001.611,"duration":7.59},{"text":"He can devote the resources to it that it deserves, and he can prevent the liberal discovery rules and the backlog of the courts
