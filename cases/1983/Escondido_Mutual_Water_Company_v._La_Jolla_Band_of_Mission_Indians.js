suffice, I think.","start":919.115,"stop":921.036,"duration":1.92},{"text":"The Pidgeon River case, which is an old administrative case in which Secretary Ickes wished that a dam not be built on an

1969.","start":976.131,"stop":982.094,"duration":5.96},{"text":"We have an open-ended condition in the license which provides that the ultimate resolution of that issue by the District Court will
