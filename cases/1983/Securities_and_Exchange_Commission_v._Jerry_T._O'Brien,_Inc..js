Powell, which simply concerned what an administrative agency must show in order to get judicial enforcement of its subpoenas.","start":196.017,"stop":207.654,"duration":11.64},{"text":"The Court then goes on to says:","start":207.654,"stop":209.605,"duration":1.95},{"text":"\"To assure that the target has the opportunity to assert this right. \"","start":209.605,"stop":214.323,"duration":4.72},{"text":"this so-called right to be investigated consistently with the Powell standards,","start":214.323,"stop":219.008,"duration":4.69},{"text":"\"notice of third party subpoenas is necessary. \"","start":219.008,"stop":221.789,"duration":2.78},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit therefore ordered the Commission to notify the targets of its investigation, a term it did not define, whenever the Commission issues a subpoena to a third party.","start":221.789,"stop":234.299,"duration":12.51},{"text":"And this is all apparently so that the target can bring some sort of legal proceedings, to assure that the subpoena to the third party complies with the Powell standards.","start":234.299,"stop":244.013,"duration":9.71},{"text":"Now, one of the problems one has in analzying the Court of Appeals' decision in this case is that it is not at all clear from the Court's short and somewhat cryptic opinion, exactly what source of legal authority the Court of Appeals thought it was relying on in imposing this unprecedented notice requirement.","start":244.013,"stop":263.381,"duration":19.37},{"text":"It seems tolerably clear that the Court of Appeals was not relying on any provision of the Constitution, and respondents seem to concede as much.","start":263.381,"stop":272.392,"duration":9.01},{"text":"I think this Court's decision in cases such as Hannah v. Larche and Fisher v. United States, United States v. Miller, leave little doubt that the Fourth and Fifth Amendments don't give anyone a protectable interest in records held by third parties, don't give anyone the right or the opportunity to challenge the validity of subpoenas for records held by third parties.","start":272.392,"stop":293.977,"duration":21.58},{"text":"It also seems fairly clear from the Court of Appeals' opinion that it wasn't relying on any expressed provisions of the securities laws, because the statutes that govern the SEC's issuance of subpoenas don't contain any requirement that the Commission notify so-called targets of its investigations each time it issues a subpoena to a third party.","start":293.977,"stop":316.312,"duration":22.34},{"text":"The fact is, I hope to discuss in a few moments, when Congress has wanted to require the Commission to give notice of its subpoenas to someone other than a subpoena recipient, it has said so expressly in carefully crafted legislation.","start":316.312,"stop":330.744,"duration":14.43},{"text":"But there is no legislation that requires that the Commission notify so-called targets when it issues subpoenas to third parties.","start":330.744,"stop":337.226,"duration":6.48},{"text":"And the Ninth Circuit's sole reason for imposing this novel third party notice requirement is apparently based on its construction of this Court's decision in United States against Powell.","start":337.226,"stop":348.065,"duration":10.84},{"text":"As I noted a moment ago, in reading from a portion of the Ninth Circuit's decision, the Ninth Circuit seems to have understood Powell as creating a right in so-called targets of an agency's investigation to be investigated consistently with the Powell standards.","start":348.065,"stop":364.043,"duration":15.98},{"text":"And to the extent that we can understand the Ninth Circuit's reasoning, it seems to have concluded that notices to third parties is essential to protect this so-called right to be investigated consistently with the Powell standards, and this is so because in the Court of Appeals' view, apparently, third party recipients of subpoenas who are not targets of an agency's investigation would not have standing to suggest that the subpoena somehow failed to satisfy the Powell standards.","start":364.043,"stop":394.546,"duration":30.5},{"text":"Now, there are a number of obvious flaws in the Court of Appeals analysis.","start":394.546,"stop":398.779,"duration":4.23},{"text":"The principal problem, of course, is that Powell has absolutely nothing at all to do with how administrative agencies go about conducting their investigations.","start":398.779,"stop":406.667,"duration":7.89},{"text":"Powell singly holds that if an agency can't get voluntary compliance with a request for information, it has to make certain showings in order to get judicial enforcement of its subpoenas.","start":406.667,"stop":416.193,"duration":9.53},{"text":"The purpose of this rule, as the Court noted in Powell, is to protect the enforcement court's own processes, not to superintend investigations conducted by agencies.","start":416.193,"stop":428.97,"duration":12.78},{"text":"And, contrary to the Court of Appeals' somewhat puzzling assumption, which I think to some extent underlies its whole notice requirement, it's quite clear that the recipient of an administrative subpoena would have standing to insist on compliance with the Powell standards, whether or not the recipient of the subpoena was a target.","start":428.97,"stop":448.087,"duration":19.12},{"text":"In fact, this Court's decision in LaSalle National Bank, a few years ago, was a case in which a recipient of a subpoena raised so-called Powell claims.","start":448.087,"stop":458.739,"duration":10.65},{"text":"The target wasn't even a party to that judicial enforcement proceeding.","start":458.739,"stop":463.518,"duration":4.78},{"text":"But Powell only concerns the rights of subpoena recipients.","start":463.518,"stop":468.391,"duration":4.87},{"text":"The decision says nothing at all about the rights of third parties, much less anything about requiring that third parties be given notice... rather, targets be given notice when subpoenas are issued to third parties.","start":468.391,"stop":482.168,"duration":13.78},{"text":"And in this respect, the Court of Appeals' reading of Powell seems quite inconsistent with this Court's subsequent decisions in Mueller and Donaldson, because Mueller and Donaldson, in fact, unlike Powell, did involve third party subpoenas and the rights of third parties, and this Court held in both cases that the target of an investigation has not legally cognizable interest in questioning whether a subpoena issued to someone else should be judicially enforced.","start":482.168,"stop":509.672,"duration":27.5}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Geller, are there any circumstances, in your view, in which the target of an

it quite clear that the standards of Rule 24b are to apply, the normal equitable standards of determining whether permissive intervention should be granted.","start":528.618,"stop":545.812,"duration":17.19},{"text":"But Donaldson makes quite clear that a target, under no circumstances, would have a right of intervention under Rule 24a of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.","start":545.812,"stop":554.419,"duration":8.61},{"text":"That was precisely, in fact, the argument that this Court rejected in Donaldson.","start":554.419,"stop":558.543,"duration":4.12},{"text":"In fact, the decision of the Ninth Circuit in this case seems flatly inconsistent with Donaldson, because in Donaldson... Donaldson, as the Court will recall, was the target of an IRS investigation, and he sought to intervene in a then-pending judicial enforcement proceeding.","start":558.543,"stop":575.114,"duration":16.57},{"text":"But the Court noted that Donaldson had no interest in the materials that were subpoenaed, other than to try to prevent the agency from getting ahold of them so that they might not be used against him.","start":575.114,"stop":584.531,"duration":9.42},{"text":"This Court held that that interest was not even strong enough to allow Donaldson to have a right of intervention in pending enforcement proceedings.","start":584.531,"stop":592.591,"duration":8.06},{"text":"So it seems quite bizarre that that same interest, which is the only interest that respondents have in this case, is strong enough to entitle them to notice simply the issuance of subpoenas.","start":592.591,"stop":603.212,"duration":10.62},{"text":"We don't know of any circumstance in which potential permissive intervenors, which is all these respondents are, have a right to be given notice of the occurrence of an event... here, the issuance of a subpoena... that might or might not ultimately lead to judicial enforcement proceedings, in which they would, at most, have the opportunity to seek permissive intervention.","start":603.212,"stop":626.187,"duration":22.98},{"text":"In fact, Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure doesn't even require that notice be given to someone who has an absolute right to intervene in a judicial proceeding, so it seems quite peculiar that only a potential permissive intervenor would have to be given... would have to be given notice.","start":626.187,"stop":644.867,"duration":18.68}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Geller, the Powell case dealt with the Internal Revenue Code, and I know the Ninth Circuit assumed...

correct.","start":685.571,"stop":686.084,"duration":0.51},{"text":"And to that extent, to the extent it is simply a construction of the statute, it would not apply to other agencies.","start":686.084,"stop":690.709,"duration":4.63},{"text":"However, as I say, some of the elements of the Powell test, such as that the subpoena be issued for a legitimate purpose and that it be relevant, seek relevant information, are, I think, simply Fourth Amendment standards.","start":690.709,"stop":701.047,"duration":10.34},{"text":"And to that extent, of course, the SEC and other

purport to identify one.","start":705.359,"stop":712.683,"duration":7.32},{"text":"There is no statutory basis for the Court of Appeals' decision, and it didn't purport to identify one.","start":712.683,"stop":717.947,"duration":5.26},{"text":"The Court of Appeals' decision seems to be based on a plain misreading of the Powell case in two respects: (1) that Powell grants rights to so-called targets of an investigation, and (2) that recipients of a subpoena who are not targets would somehow not have standing to challenge the subpoena on Powell grounds.","start":717.947,"stop":736.269,"duration":18.32},{"text":"Both of those assumptions are plainly incorrect.","start":736.269,"stop":738.767,"duration":2.5},{"text":"And, finally, the relief

judicial enforcement proceeding.","start":738.767,"stop":754.041,"duration":15.27},{"text":"That being so, it seems inconceivable that they could have a right to greater relief, which is notice, such as the Ninth Circuit ordered here.","start":754.041,"stop":762.227,"duration":8.19},{"text":"Now, I think it's important to emphasize that the issue presented in this case is of tremendous concern to the SEC and other administrative agencies, not simply because the Ninth Circuit's decision is wrong... which it is... and not simply because it would be tremendously quite burdensome administratively to try to apply this test.","start":762.227,"stop":783.67,"duration":21.44},{"text":"It's not clear what a target is; the SEC often investigates transactions rather than individuals, and it would be quite burdensome to try to figure out who has to get notice.","start":783.67,"stop":793.4,"duration":9.73},{"text":"But what really concerns the government is that the Court of Appeals' decision, the notice requirement, will severely impair the ability of the SEC and other agencies to conduct effective law enforcement investigations.","start":793.4,"stop":808.52,"duration":15.12},{"text":"And the reason for this are the reasons that this Court has consistently explained in upholding the need for secrecy in the Grand jury.","start":808.52,"stop":818.188,"duration":9.67},{"text":"If targets of a Commission's investigation had to be told at the very outset the names of the people who are being served with subpoenas by the SEC, then, of course, the target would have essentially a road map of the Commission's investigations.","start":818.188,"stop":832.072,"duration":13.88},{"text":"It would increase the target's opportunity to fabricate defenses or destroy evidence, intimidate witnesses, tailor testimony, perhaps secrete assets beyond the reach of the SEC or injured investors.","start":832.072,"stop":844.803,"duration":12.73},{"text":"And, in addition, many people, especially cooperative, confidential informants, might decline to cooperate with the SEC if they knew that their names would immediately have to be given over to the targets, to so-called targets of the investigation.","start":844.803,"stop":860.03,"duration":15.23},{"text":"And I should add that this is not a speculative or fanciful concern on the SEC's part.","start":860.03,"stop":865.388,"duration":5.36},{"text":"In the Wedbush case, which was a follow-up to this case in the Ninth Circuit, the District Court ordered the SEC to provide the targets of that investigation with the names of subpoena recipients.","start":865.388,"stop":878.975,"duration":13.59},{"text":"The SEC sought a stay from the Ninth Circuit and specifically argued... and this is on page 28a of the Appendix to the Government's Petition... specifically argued that some of the third party witnesses had requested confidentiality, and the disclosure of these witnesses to the target would impair the effectiveness of the investigation.","start":878.975,"stop":897.828,"duration":18.85},{"text":"Despite this, the Ninth Circuit summarily denied a stay in Wedbush and ordered the SEC to provide the so-called targets of that investigation, with the names of third party subpoena recipients.","start":897.828,"stop":910.525,"duration":12.7},{"text":"Finally, providing notice would tremendously increase the opportunities for delay in conducting an investigation, and would prejudice the privacy rights of people called to testify or produce evidence in the investigation.","start":910.525,"stop":924.051,"duration":13.53},{"text":"These consequences are important, we believe, because Congress could not possibly have intended them, at least without expressly saying so.","start":924.051,"stop":932.079,"duration":8.03},{"text":"And, as I pointed out earlier, there's no provision of the securities laws that requires this sort of notice, and in this regard, it's extremely significant that Congress has enacted legislation that does, in very limited circumstances, require the SEC and other agencies to give notice to certain types of people when subpoenas have been served on third parties.","start":932.079,"stop":953.976,"duration":21.9},{"text":"Section 21h of the Securities Exchange Act incorporates the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which

other agencies have to give customers of banks notice when administrative agencies serve subpoenas on banks for the private records of these customers.","start":963.629,"stop":982.34,"duration":18.71},{"text":"Now, I think the enactment of Section 21h and the Right to Financial Privacy Act is very instructive, for two reasons.","start":982.34,"stop":988.713,"duration":6.37},{"text":"First, it shows that Congress clearly knows how to provide for a notice requirement when it wants to do so.","start":988.713,"stop":993.647,"duration":4.93},{"text":"And the debates on Section 21h in the Right to Financial Privacy Act leave no doubt that Congress thought, when it was enacting those statutes, that there was no sort of requirement in the law previous to that point, such as the Ninth Circuit seems to have discovered in this case.","start":993.647,"stop":1008.36,"duration":14.71},{"text":"And secondly, I think the enactment of Section 21h is quite instructive, because when Congress did impose a notice requirement, it quickly surrounded that requirement with a number of protections designed to prevent the sort of harms that I was discussing a few moments ago.","start":1008.36,"stop":1026.198,"duration":17.84},{"text":"And, needless to say, th Ninth Circuit's ruling does not contain any of these protections, nor could it.","start":1026.198,"stop":1032.851,"duration":6.65},{"text":"We think what all of this shows is that the Ninth Circuit's ruling represents nothing more than that court's notion of what constitutes sound public policy, and even if th Court of Appeals were right in that judgment, and we doubt that it was, it was not a judgment that the Court of Appeals was entitled to make.","start":1032.851,"stop":1049.296,"duration":16.44},{"text":"There is no constitutional or statutory requirement that the SEC or other agencies give notice to the so-called targets of its

is a lesser position that this Court could take and still grant the relief which the Respondents now seek and continue to seek, and that is, that notice is not something you are entitled to in all cases, but notice is something that a target would be entitled to after having made a showing of some evidence that there are subpoenas being issued to third parties, that there are outstanding subpoenas that we're not aware of, and that in turn some showing can be made that these subpoenas do not meet or exceed Powell standards to the extent, as in this case, our argument basically is, and we believe we've made that showing below... certainly we've alleged it and those pleadings are deemed true before this Court, and that is this: that in the case of the legitimate purpose requirement
