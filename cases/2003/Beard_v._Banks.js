Ohio for the general proposition that it's beyond dispute that the sentencer, quote/unquote, may not be precluded from considering mitigation.","start":136.969,"stop":147.388,"duration":10.42},{"text":"But before Mills, the sentencer, quote/unquote, always referred to the judge or the jury, never to individual jurors.","start":147.388,"stop":154.264,"duration":6.88},{"text":"That was a leap made for the first time in Mills.","start":154.264,"stop":157.153,"duration":2.89},{"text":"That was new.","start":157.153,"stop":158.146,"duration":0.99},{"text":"Even with a unanimity charge, although there wasn't one in this case, as we'll address, a jury still considered the evidence in the manner that juries historically have considered evidence, that is collaboratively.","start":158.146,"stop":169.95,"duration":11.8},{"text":"Until Mills, the Constitution had never been read to forbid unanimity as to verdicts, whether general verdicts or special verdicts.","start":169.95,"stop":176.843,"duration":6.89},{"text":"And even since Mills, as this Court recently said in Jones v.
