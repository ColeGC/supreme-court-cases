certiorari to the Eleventh Circuit, which upheld the Florida law on the remarkable proposition that a law that prohibits banks from selling life insurance is, within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, a law that regulates the business of insurance, while a 1916 Federal law that explicitly does the contrary and authorizes national banks to sell life insurance is not, within
