presents to the Court the question whether a state statute of limitations applicable to the commencement of judicial proceedings should be disregarded in a Section 1983 suit solely on the ground that the limitation period, six months, is per se unreasonably short, and consequently inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.","start":11.46,"stop":42.498,"duration":31.04},{"text":"Respondent commenced suit on April 21st, 1981, to redress alleged discrimination on the basis of sex by her employer, the School District of Springfield Township.","start":42.498,"stop":55.238,"duration":12.74},{"text":"One of her claims sought relief under Section 1983.","start":55.238,"stop":59.059,"duration":3.82},{"text":"In the alternative, respondent sought relief under Section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.","start":59.059,"stop":66.374,"duration":7.31},{"text":"Under her theory, the last act of discrimination occurred in September of 1980, some seven or eight months earlier, when a man was

the dismissal of the 1983 claim on the ground that the six-month statute of limitations was so short as to be inherently inconsistent with the policies fostered by the Civil Rights Act.","start":94.963,"stop":112.293,"duration":17.33},{"text":"The school district defendants applied for rehearing, and the application was denied, with four judges voting to grant the rehearing.","start":112.293,"stop":120.71,"duration":8.42},{"text":"Now, there is no question in this case that the statute at issue was properly identified as the most appropriate state statute of limitations.","start":120.71,"stop":131.628,"duration":10.92},{"text":"Therefore the question left for resolution is what the Court labeled in the recent case of Burnett versus Cratton as the third step in a Section 1983 inquiry, that is, is the state statute inconsistent with federal law?","start":131.628,"stop":148.518,"duration":16.89},{"text":"I submit that this inquiry should be confined to a determination whether the state statute discriminates against federal rights or provides so short a time so as to effectively preclude litigating a civil rights

and federal claims.","start":185.092,"stop":188.285,"duration":3.19},{"text":"A more cogent reason is found in the holding of the Third Circuit which held it was the analogous statute of limitations.","start":188.285,"stop":197.491,"duration":9.21},{"text":"Implicit in this finding was that the state and federal law claims were being treated equally.","start":197.491,"stop":203.816,"duration":6.32},{"text":"Here there is no basis for rejection of the Pennsylvania statute on the ground that it discriminates against federal civil rights actions.","start":203.816,"stop":214.151,"duration":10.34},{"text":"The six-month statute of limitations at issue in this case is one expressly applicable to the commencement of judicial proceedings

injunctive relief.","start":235.125,"stop":238.898,"duration":3.77},{"text":"For these reasons, its enactment should raise a presumption that the legislature took into account the burden of the parties to the suit governed by the limitation, and the practicalities involved in litigating civil rights claims, and found the limitation period to be a reasonable one.","start":238.898,"stop":257.749,"duration":18.85},{"text":"The determination of the Pennsylvania legislature that a six-month period is a reasonable one within which to commence litigation,

Teamsters.","start":257.749,"stop":276.212,"duration":18.46},{"text":"That case impliedly recognized that a six-month limitation period was sufficient for the commencement of relatively complex federal litigation.","start":276.212,"stop":286.209,"duration":10},{"text":"That case cuts across any conclusion that the practicalities of litigation necessarily mean that a six-month period is an unreasonable time in which to bring a federal cause of action.","start":286.209,"stop":298.335,"duration":12.13},{"text":"An inquiry into the record of this case would disclose no basis for finding that the six-month limitation period was unreasonable.","start":298.335,"stop":308.211,"duration":9.88},{"text":"In this case, the type of injury alleged, its magnitude and consequence, the denial of appointment to a higher position, and the consequent loss of increased pay, benefits, and opportunities for future advancement should have been immediately recognized.","start":308.211,"stop":326.284,"duration":18.07},{"text":"In a case such as this, the degrees and certificates held by each applicant, as well as their relative experience is a matter of public record, and therefore the individual knows or should have known the merit of his credentials or her credentials relative to other applicants in the election process.","start":326.284,"stop":348.089,"duration":21.81},{"text":"Finally, arguments that the six-month period is unreasonable also fail when balanced against the state policies sought to be fostered by state statutes of limitations, policies which have long been recognized as fundamental to a well-ordered judicial system, whether state or federal.","start":348.089,"stop":368.313,"duration":20.22},{"text":"Here, because state and local governments are more likely to experience frequent changes in personnel than other employers, prompt assertion of claim is important.","start":368.313,"stop":382.482,"duration":14.17},{"text":"Because public officials' continued service is subject to the will of the electorate, or if they be appointed, to the discretion of elected officials, even a short passage of time may result in the departure of persons with knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim.","start":382.482,"stop":401.812,"duration":19.33},{"text":"This in turn would impair the accuracy of the factfinding
