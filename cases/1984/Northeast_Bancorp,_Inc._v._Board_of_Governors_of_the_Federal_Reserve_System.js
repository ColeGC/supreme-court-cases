Shapiro","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":103.608,"stop":106.563,"duration":2.95},{"text":"At issue in this case is the constitutionality of regional banking laws enacted by the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts which permit New England bank holding companies to enter those states and engage in full service commercial banking, but which withhold that same right from bank holding companies located in other sister states.","start":106.563,"stop":127.664,"duration":21.1},{"text":"The first question presented is whether the Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act immunizes the statutes from scrutiny under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.","start":127.664,"stop":138.182,"duration":10.52},{"text":"The second question is whether these laws are part of an agreement among the states which requires Congress' approval under the Compact Clause of the Constitution.","start":138.182,"stop":147.979,"duration":9.8},{"text":"And after briefly describing these statutes, I'd like to address all of these questions.","start":147.979,"stop":152.981,"duration":5},{"text":"The Massachusetts and Connecticut laws permit companies from six designated New England states to enter those states and engage in full service commercial banking if the other New England state extends reciprocity to Connecticut and Massachusetts.","start":152.981,"stop":169.354,"duration":16.37},{"text":"These regional laws operate in combination with another regional law enacted by the state of Rhode Island, and together they set up a multistate common market which permits some companies to come in and denies that same right to other companies based solely on the location or the state origin of those other companies.","start":169.354,"stop":190.706,"duration":21.35},{"text":"Thus, some companies in some states get important competitive benefits which are withheld from other companies based solely on geography or state of origin.","start":190.706,"stop":200.253,"duration":9.55},{"text":"Now, these statutes in New England were designed to permit regional expansion of bank holding companies in New England while excluding companies from the neighboring state of New York, regardless of their proximity to New England and regardless of their size.","start":200.253,"stop":215.593,"duration":15.34},{"text":"By the same token, companies that are in New England such as petitioner Northeast Bancorp, are unable to merger with banks located directly across the New York border.","start":215.593,"stop":225.138,"duration":9.55},{"text":"The practical impact of these laws can be illustrated with a simple example.","start":225.138,"stop":230.193,"duration":5.06},{"text":"Before passage of these laws, companies in Massachusetts and in New York competed on an equal basis for business in Connecticut.","start":230.193,"stop":238.267,"duration":8.07},{"text":"Each could offer full service commercial banking in its home state, but neither could offer full service commercial banking in the state of Connecticut.","start":238.267,"stop":246.782,"duration":8.52},{"text":"Now, however, Massachusetts companies can have full service banks both in their own home state and in the state of Connecticut, while their direct competitors in the state of New York are still limited to their one home state.","start":246.782,"stop":259.692,"duration":12.91},{"text":"As the Court is aware, these regionally discriminatory laws are not an isolated phenomenon.","start":259.692,"stop":264.965,"duration":5.27},{"text":"New York is flanked by the New England laws on the east, and directly to the south its neighbors are in the process of forming another exclusionary market, the Mid-Atlantic market.","start":264.965,"stop":276.222,"duration":11.26},{"text":"And there is a similar combination of states in the southeast which also excludes the state of New York.","start":276.222,"stop":281.715,"duration":5.49},{"text":"We are thus witnessing a partitioning of the entire East Coast into exclusive banking zones, and as the Court is aware, some other... some 20 other states are in the process of considering regionally exclusive banking laws which would divide the countries into other regions throughout the entire nation.","start":281.715,"stop":299.246,"duration":17.53},{"text":"Now, as the Solicitor General and the Board have acknowledged and the other respondents do not dispute, these laws would violate the Commerce Clause unless approved by Congress.","start":299.246,"stop":309.284,"duration":10.04},{"text":"As this Court stated in the Eisenberg Farm case, and I quote,","start":309.284,"stop":313.306,"duration":4.02},{"text":"\"The United States could not exist as a nation if each of them were to have the power to discriminate as against sister states with respect to admitting articles of commerce. \"","start":313.306,"stop":324.974,"duration":11.67},{"text":"\"And when combinations of states jointly impose this kind of discrimination in unison, the danger of injury and divisiveness and retaliation is even greater. \"","start":324.974,"stop":335.481,"duration":10.51},{"text":"Now, where there is this kind of a threat to the core purposes of the Commerce Clause, this Court's decisions require proof that Congress unmistakably gave its consent to otherwise invalid state legislation.","start":335.481,"stop":348.611,"duration":13.13},{"text":"And that, we say, is a burden which respondents cannot sustain in this proceeding.","start":348.611,"stop":353.132,"duration":4.52},{"text":"The Solicitor General on the one hand has made the argument that the plain language of the Douglas Amendment permits this kind of discrimination among sister states.","start":353.132,"stop":363.56,"duration":10.43},{"text":"But all that the Douglas Amendment says is that the Board may not approve an acquisition unless there is a state law in existence which permits the acquisition.","start":363.56,"stop":372.915,"duration":9.36},{"text":"It doesn't say a single word about the various kinds of laws which a state might adopt, and it certainly doesn't say that a state in lifting the federal ban is free to pick and choose among sister states or to join into a regional confederation which sets up a preferential trade zone for some states and excludes the others.","start":372.915,"stop":392.188,"duration":19.27}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"But doesn't the very paucity of language, Mr. Shapiro, suggest that the states were given very wide latitude; that all Congress was interested in was state approval?","start":392.188,"stop":400.202,"duration":8.01}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen M. Shapiro","textObjs":[{"text":"To the contrary, Your Honor.","start":400.202,"stop":401.794,"duration":1.59},{"text":"When Congress defers to the states in this manner with general language of this sort, the Court has made it quite clear that the presumption is that Congress means to defer to constitutionally valid state law; and when it refers to state law in these very general terms, the negative ingredients of the dormant Commerce Clause are part and parcel of the state law to which Congress has deferred.","start":401.794,"stop":423.818,"duration":22.02}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, Mr Shapiro, I suppose the McCarran-Ferguson Act doesn't really make it unmistakably clear that states can adopt reciprocal discriminatory taxes, and yet, the Court upheld that power in cases like Western and Southern.","start":423.818,"stop":444.802,"duration":20.98}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen M. Shapiro","textObjs":[{"text":"That's a very important question, and the distinction is between night and day; and let me explain that.","start":444.802,"stop":449.735,"duration":4.93},{"text":"In the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the statute explicitly says not only that the states may regulate, but that the silence of Congress shall not be deemed to be any barrier to regulation or taxation of insurance within the state.","start":449.735,"stop":463.416,"duration":13.68},{"text":"And the legislative history, of course, was that this was an area that traditionally had not been treated as part of commerce.","start":463.416,"stop":470.249,"duration":6.83},{"text":"And then in 1944 this Court changed the construction on that question, and all of a sudden state laws across the country were exposed to Commerce Clause challenge.","start":470.249,"stop":478.454,"duration":8.2},{"text":"Congress acted within one year to pass this law which expressly stated that it was lifting the negative implications of the dormant Commerce Clause.","start":478.454,"stop":487.621,"duration":9.17},{"text":"So you have unmistakable language, and you have unmistakable language in the legislative history.","start":487.621,"stop":492.443,"duration":4.82},{"text":"And we say there is nothing remotely resembling that in the Douglas Amendment.","start":492.443,"stop":497.356,"duration":4.91},{"text":"Now, our brothers, the private respondents, have made the somewhat different argument here on the authorization point, that Congress' division of the banking industry along state lines is such a splintering or such a balkanization that the states should be free to pick and choose among sister states and set up their own regional lines.","start":497.356,"stop":516.749,"duration":19.39},{"text":"But this also is directly in the teeth of recent decisions of this court.","start":516.749,"stop":521.372,"duration":4.62},{"text":"In the Bacchus case, decided only last term, federal law had balkanized the entire industry along state lines, had given the states plenary power to permit or not permit the importation of liquor, and yet that was not sufficient to displace the requirements of the Commerce Clause with respect to discriminatory state taxation.","start":521.372,"stop":541.495,"duration":20.12}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
