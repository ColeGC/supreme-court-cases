addressing that federal question, Justice, when it is available to the federal courts, to address it as a federal question, and address it in a way that will provide not only some guide to the lower

acknowledged that characterization is merely a means of identifying state law, have quite appropriately where there is an express state determination, an application of a particular limitation, said

is only a tool.","start":514.759,"stop":523.925,"duration":9.17},{"text":"This statute of limitations, the two-year New Mexico limitation, if there were no state court decision, would certainly be the most analogous cause of action.","start":523.925,"stop":536.104,"duration":12.18},{"text":"It is certainly the most specific applicable to the facts in this case.","start":536.104,"stop":542.446,"duration":6.34},{"text":"This is a very straightforward physical assault and battery action, though it of course raises grave constitutional actions as well as simply common law torts.","start":542.446,"stop":556.165,"duration":13.72},{"text":"But certainly in terms of the underlying facts, there is nothing exotic about it which requires difficult analysis to find the most appropriate limitation.","start":556.165,"stop":568.106,"duration":11.94},{"text":"The two-year limitation which the state has applies to state causes of actions against law enforcement officers for their assaults and batteries, but also, and we submit this is significant, it is a two-year limitation which applies to a state cause of action against law enforcement officers for bodily injury that they have caused and results in a deprivation of United States constitutional rights.","start":568.106,"stop":602.727,"duration":34.62},{"text":"I believe this is a very unique provision of state law, when you examine the New Mexico tort claims scheme.","start":602.727,"stop":613.243,"duration":10.52},{"text":"It contains this quite unusual recognition of the development of 1983 action certainly in the area of actions against law enforcement officers by stating quite specifically that under statelaw, there is a right to sue a law enforcement officer for depriving one of his constitutional rights.","start":613.243,"stop":636.798,"duration":23.55},{"text":"So, when you analyze this case in terms not only of underlying facts, who did what to whom, but what are the elements of it, there is a very clear analogy, and the lower federal courts were simply wrong in not following that analogy.","start":636.798,"stop":654.851,"duration":18.05},{"text":"This statute as well as the case before you does involve drawing a different limitation period for certain actions against public officials and private individuals.","start":654.851,"stop":671.641,"duration":16.79},{"text":"Private assaults would be allowed three years to sue under New Mexico law.","start":671.641,"stop":678.606,"duration":6.97},{"text":"This statute allows suits against government entities and public officials for these types of suits to be

itself is an inconsistency which requires that this statute be rejected.","start":687.221,"stop":695.457,"duration":8.24},{"text":"We submit that that is not an inconsistency which undercuts, is hostile to 1983 goals of compensation and deterrence.","start":695.457,"stop":708.225,"duration":12.77},{"text":"It is not enough to examine simply the difference in the period of time without, I submit, examining the entire statute in which this limitation is contained.","start":708.225,"stop":720.153,"duration":11.93},{"text":"And when that is done, Justices, there is something very important found in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.","start":720.153,"stop":727.477,"duration":7.32},{"text":"That Act makes the state in effect a liability insurance company to pay actions, both the state law for torts which can be brought against the state, and also expressly provides that the State of New Mexico will pay all settlements and judgments which are brought against state public officials, not only for state torts but again for deprivation of United States constitutional rights.","start":727.477,"stop":763.08,"duration":35.6},{"text":"This statutory scheme, which the respondents find so hostile to 1983, in fact makes 1983 recoveries more than, as they can be in some cases, only a paper judgment.","start":763.08,"stop":778.06,"duration":14.98},{"text":"It guarantees the payment, the compensation which implements 1983 goals.","start":778.06,"stop":788.328,"duration":10.27},{"text":"There is necessarily in any state's consideration of meshing its tort claim scheme to 1983 actions considerations which I believe are different than those in the private sector, and what finally must be decided is whether the balancing involved is a reasonable balancing.","start":788.328,"stop":812.574,"duration":24.25},{"text":"I would observe that Congress as well in considering the availability of private actions versus suits against the government has drawn similar distinctions.","start":812.574,"stop":826.993,"duration":14.42},{"text":"In maritime torts, United States boats are subject to suit within two years.","start":826.993,"stop":834.557,"duration":7.56},{"text":"Maritime torts against private owners, three years.","start":834.557,"stop":838.08,"duration":3.52},{"text":"So there is necessarily in any consideration of compensation such as the New Mexico legislation is addressed to a balancing of factors, and the question becomes whether that balancing has been carried on reasonably.","start":838.08,"stop":855.02,"duration":16.94},{"text":"The final test really of inconsistency here is whether any state policy, any state rule, any state interest which is exhibited in that limitation has somehow precluded this respondent from getting to the federal court, and the answer to that is quite clear.","start":855.02,"stop":878.639,"duration":23.62},{"text":"For two years the courthouse doors were open to the respondent without any possible hostility exhibited by state law in any respect.","start":878.639,"stop":893.698,"duration":15.06},{"text":"The respondent's action here is precluded quite simply because he slept on his rights for a period of two years.","start":893.698,"stop":905.323,"duration":11.63},{"text":"No reasonable argument, and it is not made in any of the briefs, is made that that period of time is too short.","start":905.323,"stop":914.84,"duration":9.52},{"text":"It is the same period of time which Congress in waiving United States immunity allows for actions against federal law enforcement officers under the Tort Claim Act.","start":914.84,"stop":928.838,"duration":14},{"text":"We submit that this provision, this limitation, which is general in its scope, does not discriminate against 1983 and civil rights actions.","start":928.838,"stop":940.606,"duration":11.77},{"text":"It is not inconsistent.","start":940.606,"stop":942.429,"duration":1.82},{"text":"And petitioners ask that the motions which they have filed nd pursued in both lower federal courts be granted here, and the case
