position is that for all purposes other than the charges mentioned in the detainer, the prisoner remains subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state; that therefore, in this case the trial court

refuses to give up the product of its earlier overreaction: the void conviction of the petitioner.","start":408.318,"stop":422.556,"duration":14.24},{"text":"We submit that this reluctance of the State of Indiana is indeed contrary to their own best interests as signatories to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.","start":422.556,"stop":434.594,"duration":12.04},{"text":"Now, we have set forth the operative facts in summary fashion on pages 2 and 3 of our brief and in more plenary fashion at pages 3 through 8.","start":434.594,"stop":444.531,"duration":9.94},{"text":"The facts involve what we in Indiana call two criminal causes.","start":444.531,"stop":449.905,"duration":5.37},{"text":"The first cause, Section 424, involves three charges of dealing with a controlled substance called Diazepam.","start":449.905,"stop":458.751,"duration":8.85},{"text":"The second cause, Cause 470, deals with delivery of marijuana.","start":458.751,"stop":466.427,"duration":7.68},{"text":"Now, the underlying events with respect to the first of those causes, the Diazepam cause... that's the cause we contend he should not have been tried upon... took place over a three-month period in early 1979.","start":466.427,"stop":481.467,"duration":15.04},{"text":"And the petitioner was arraigned on those charges in April of 1979.","start":481.467,"stop":488.26,"duration":6.79},{"text":"Now, as we've noted in some detail in our brief at page 4, he initially pleaded guilty... not guilty to those charges, and then later attempted to plead guilty pursuant to a plea agreement.","start":488.26,"stop":499.718,"duration":11.46},{"text":"But the trial judge refused to accept the plea agreement, because he considered the plea to be improvident.","start":499.718,"stop":505.691,"duration":5.97},{"text":"The trial was set eventually for March 1980 but later continued.","start":505.691,"stop":511.043,"duration":5.35},{"text":"Before trial was had on that first Diazepam cause, the one which is in question here, the petitioner was arraigned in May of 1980 on the second cause, the marijuana cause.","start":511.043,"stop":523.552,"duration":12.51},{"text":"The underlying events with respect to that cause took place in December 1979, almost 12 months after the underlying events for the first cause, and therefore, there is no question that they were not in any way related crimes, and no one has contended that.","start":523.552,"stop":540.854,"duration":17.3},{"text":"In November 1980, after he had been arraigned on both causes but not tried on either, the petitioner was incarcerated by the State of Michigan pursuant to an unrelated felony charge.","start":540.854,"stop":556.514,"duration":15.66},{"text":"In March 1981, after he had been in Michigan incarceration for several months, the prosecutor from Howard County, Indiana mailed to the warden of the prison in Jackson, Michigan a detainer which indicated that he wished to bring the petitioner to trial on two counts of dealing in marijuana.","start":556.514,"stop":580.311,"duration":23.8},{"text":"Now, if I may anticipate a question at this point, it ought to be noted that one of the follow-up documents which was sent to Michigan to obtain temporary custody of the petitioner several months after the actual detainer was filed erroneously listed the cause number for the Diazepam counts, and said the petitioner was wanted on three counts of dealing in marijuana.","start":580.311,"stop":610.611,"duration":30.3},{"text":"Now, at trial the State of Indiana contended that this in fact was an independent detainer with respect to the Diazepam counts.","start":610.611,"stop":619.688,"duration":9.08},{"text":"The court of appeals of Indiana in its opinion... and you'll note this at the Joint Appendix page 168... said that no reasonable factfinder could reach that conclusion.","start":619.688,"stop":630.175,"duration":10.49},{"text":"And I note that the State of Indiana has in fact dropped that contention at this point.","start":630.175,"stop":635.539,"duration":5.36},{"text":"So in short, having been told that he was going to return to Indiana to stand trial on two counts of delivery of marijuana, the petitioner waived his rights under Article 4 of the IAD, came across the border and... in the custody of Indiana authorities.","start":635.539,"stop":655.381,"duration":19.84},{"text":"He came across on July 21st, 1981 from Jackson prison in Indiana over to Howard County, city of Kokomo in Indiana.","start":655.381,"stop":670.922,"duration":15.54},{"text":"That's northcentral Indiana.","start":670.922,"stop":673.604,"duration":2.68},{"text":"On July 23rd he did file with the court a suggested plea bargain with respect to the Diazepam cause on the ground, but later withdrew it, and he filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that he had been brought across the border unwittingly with respect to the Diazepam charges.","start":673.604,"stop":698.989,"duration":25.38}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
