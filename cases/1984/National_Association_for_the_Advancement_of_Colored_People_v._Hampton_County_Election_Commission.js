Act.","start":101.632,"stop":117.975,"duration":16.34},{"text":"Hampton County is a small, rural county in the lower part of the state, just across the river from the State of

school districts.","start":129.015,"stop":131.884,"duration":2.87},{"text":"District 1 in the north is pretty well integrated, well financed because of a good tax base, including some industrial area, and has generally been fairly successful.","start":131.884,"stop":144.109,"duration":12.23},{"text":"District 2 in the south is mostly black, a very poor school district, suffering largely from a very poor tax base.","start":144.109,"stop":152.964,"duration":8.85},{"text":"These disparities between the two school districts have produced considerable political controversy in the county, especially controversy between supporters of a strong countywide board of education who have been mostly black, and those supporters of strong autonomous district boards who have been mostly whites, especially in the northern part of the county.","start":152.964,"stop":172.711,"duration":19.75},{"text":"In 1982 this controversy culminated in the General Assembly's passing Act 549.","start":172.711,"stop":181.131,"duration":8.42},{"text":"Act 549 abolished the county board and changed the district boards from appointed boards to elected district boards.","start":181.131,"stop":189.303,"duration":8.17},{"text":"It provided that the elections for the district boards would be held in November along with the general elections, and it also

31.","start":189.303,"stop":204.98,"duration":15.68},{"text":"For reasons that will probably become clear, preclearance of this statute, which was passed in the spring of 1982, was not obtained until after the November election date, that is, until mid-November 1982.","start":204.98,"stop":219.24,"duration":14.26},{"text":"Because preclearance had not been obtained, the election did not go forward.","start":219.24,"stop":223.91,"duration":4.67},{"text":"However, despite the absence of preclearance, the Appellees, the election commission, had gone ahead with a filing period in August of 1982.","start":223.91,"stop":235.951,"duration":12.04},{"text":"After preclearance was obtained, in the middle of November, the election commission then set about to set a special election.","start":235.951,"stop":243.188,"duration":7.24},{"text":"They did so selecting a date in March 1983 without preclearing that date, and they also then selected a filing period also without preclearance.","start":243.188,"stop":253.413,"duration":10.23},{"text":"The filing period happened to be the same dates in August of 1982 that they had previously had the previous year at a time when the statute had not been precleared.","start":253.413,"stop":264.221,"duration":10.81},{"text":"In fact, that filing period was enforced in 1983 by turning away several candidates, including one of the plaintiffs, who appeared after the announcement of the March election and wanted to run in that election.","start":264.221,"stop":276.694,"duration":12.47},{"text":"Those people were turned away.","start":276.694,"stop":278.161,"duration":1.47},{"text":"This suit, therefore, was brought to stop the special election in March, chiefly because there had been no preclearance of the election date with filing period.","start":278.161,"stop":288.752,"duration":10.59},{"text":"The District Court upheld the Appellees in both the setting of the special election without preclearance, and the setting of the filing period without preclearance on the grounds essentially that election dates and filing periods are in effect not covered by Section 5 because they are ministerial, administrative, or things of that sort, and in the alternative, the District Court held that when the department had cleared the statute at 549 in November, that that clearance was essentially blanket approval of all that had gone before as well as all that might come afterward, even though at the time of the Department's clearance in November it was not even known whether or when there would be a special election

number of instances in which filing periods or other situations have gone forward without somebody suing them, I think the law is clear that an act may not be enforced, and what you have is citizens who read the that Voting Rights Act says nothing can be enforced until it is precleared, and if a citizen is entitled to rely on the law, then I think a citizen should not be forced to the choice of

Rights Act.","start":1050.71,"stop":1068.588,"duration":17.88},{"text":"The major theme of the Appellees' argument and the District Court's opinion, as I read it, is that the Attorney General can be deemed to have precleared changes implicitly, that is to say, he can be deemed to have cleared them even though he was not aware that he was clearing them, and Even though in this case he did not know of the changes and could not possibly have known about the changes because they had not even teen instituted at the time he issued his preclearance.","start":1068.588,"stop":1098.959,"duration":30.37},{"text":"Now, this argument in one form or another has been made to the Court on several occasions in Allen, in Sheffield County, and

emphasize is that the practicalities of administering Section 5 make it very important that as the Attorney General's regulations require, covered jurisdictions make a clear statement in their submission of exactly what changes they are seeking to have precleared, and that no changes be deemed precleared except on the basis of such a clear submission.","start":1113.219,"stop":1139.017,"duration":25.8},{"text":"Now, the reason that is important is that as Congress recognized, and as our experience in administering Section 5 has shown, a lot of the threats to equality in voting occur at the level of low visibility nuts and bolts electoral decisions that can only be properly evaluated in a particular local context.","start":1139.017,"stop":1162.967,"duration":23.95},{"text":"For example, the legislative history of the Voting Rights Act mentions a change from paper ballots to voting machines as the kind
