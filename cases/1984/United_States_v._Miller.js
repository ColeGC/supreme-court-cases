that is, there is no reason to suppose in Bain that the proof that showed the agent was deceived would act also have showed that the Comptroller was deceived, whereas here one of the descriptive paragraphs in the indictment was not in fact proved at trial.","start":461.579,"stop":489.678,"duration":28.1},{"text":"Nevertheless, the kind of reasoning that the Court used in Bain does very strongly support the result reached by the Court of Appeals.","start":489.678,"stop":497.378,"duration":7.7},{"text":"However, the continuing vitality or validity of Bain can't be discussed here without also considering the Court's holdings 40 years later in two cases...

I'm paraphrasing... nobody could seriously contend that Salinger's right to indictment had been defeated by the failure to prove most of what was alleged in the indictment, as long as what was proved was sufficient to make out an offense.","start":569.645,"stop":588.841,"duration":19.2},{"text":"In Ford, which came along a year later, the Court was confronted with a case which was almost exactly like Bain.","start":588.841,"stop":597.789,"duration":8.95},{"text":"In Ford, what happened was that the indictment charged a conspiracy with multiple objectives, one of the objectives being the violation of a treaty.","start":597.789,"stop":606.52,"duration":8.73},{"text":"And as it turned out, the violation of a treaty was not a crime and, therefore, a conspiracy to violate the treaty was not a crime.","start":606.52,"stop":617.313,"duration":10.79},{"text":"But the other objectives charged in the indictment was in fact valid crimes.","start":617.313,"stop":622.03,"duration":4.72},{"text":"Ford came to this Court invoking Ex Parte Bain, and, as you see, the case is quite parallel because Ford involved a partial allegation of something that was not in fact a crime, just as Bain involved in part an allegation of something that was not a crime.","start":622.03,"stop":639.163,"duration":17.13},{"text":"And the Court said it's mere surplusage and it can be ignored.","start":639.163,"stop":644.145,"duration":4.98},{"text":"Now that would have and in fact in Salinger the Court used language of limitation, limiting Salinger to its facts.","start":644.145,"stop":654.392,"duration":10.25},{"text":"That would probably have been enough to put Bain to rest, except for the fact that about 25 years ago Bain was cited favorably in Stirone against the United States and then again in Russell, and that has somewhat raised the question again as to whether Bain somehow remains good law despite what was done to it in Salinger and Ford.","start":654.392,"stop":677.647,"duration":23.25},{"text":"Now let me turn from a discussion of specific precedents to a somewhat broader effort to fit the issue that is presented here into the fabric of modern grand jury law and considerations of logic and policy that I think quite clearly suggest what the answer ought to be in this case.","start":677.647,"stop":696.874,"duration":19.23},{"text":"Let me first ask the question which is involved in the way the Ninth Circuit looked at this case, and that is whether it is a proper approach to determine the fit between the indictment and the proof at trial to ask whether the grand jury might not have indicted on the basis of the proof at trial.","start":696.874,"stop":721.004,"duration":24.13},{"text":"Now preliminarily, before getting to that question, I would like to say that the premise that the Ninth Circuit relied on here, speculating that the grand jury might not have indicted, is a quite implausible premise.","start":721.004,"stop":738.061,"duration":17.06},{"text":"After all, the crime was rooking the insurance company out of money in connection with a claim under a policy to which respondent well knew he was not entitled, and a substantial sum of money at that.","start":738.061,"stop":749.306,"duration":11.25},{"text":"That was the gravamen of the crime.","start":749.306,"stop":750.696,"duration":1.39},{"text":"Is it really conceivable that a grand jury presented only with a grossly inflated claim would have elected not to indict?","start":750.696,"stop":758.302,"duration":7.61}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
