money.","start":199.792,"stop":219.154,"duration":19.36},{"text":"The backup agents that were with Agent Holmes were approaching the scene to affect

petitioners.","start":243.911,"stop":251.047,"duration":7.14},{"text":"The issue was not raised until the brief was filed with the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit permitted the issue to be argued and decided on its merits.","start":251.047,"stop":262.303,"duration":11.26},{"text":"In the Eleventh Circuit opinion the conclusion was that the statute seemed very plain and unambiguous.","start":262.303,"stop":269.155,"duration":6.85},{"text":"Basically, the Government's position was adopted, and the petitioners were... had their convictions affirmed.","start":269.155,"stop":276.932,"duration":7.78},{"text":"I had stated in the very beginning that I intended to show that the statute was in fact ambiguous, and I think that the way to understand it is to look at the way in which the Government is contending the statute should be read.","start":276.932,"stop":292.784,"duration":15.85},{"text":"By looking at the words themselves you have a very unusual situation here.","start":292.784,"stop":299.837,"duration":7.05},{"text":"You have three clauses that are separated by a disjunctive \"or\".","start":299.837,"stop":306.202,"duration":6.37},{"text":"The Government has argued that in fact there are two clauses separated by a disjunctive \"or\", and that one clause being mail matter,

prohibited.","start":320.901,"stop":330.217,"duration":9.32},{"text":"And the Government presumes that the intention of Congress in reading that statute was to have \"property of the United

which is \"any money\".","start":341.234,"stop":346.059,"duration":4.83},{"text":"Well, in the same breath the Government contends, and the Eleventh Circuit seemed to accept this argument at the time, that the use of the disjunctive always establishes completely and wholly separate categories of crimes.","start":346.059,"stop":361.259,"duration":15.2},{"text":"In order to determine or to rule that the plain reading of this statute establishes that, you have to take away from mail matter the other parts that were added in 1935.","start":361.259,"stop":376.339,"duration":15.08},{"text":"Otherwise, you may have, in fact, what the petitioners contend, which is a statute which was only designed to... to close what was perceived in 1935 to be a loophole in the Postal Robbery statute.","start":376.339,"stop":391.808,"duration":15.47},{"text":"Now, how does this... how does this work?","start":391.808,"stop":394.261,"duration":2.45},{"text":"If we take each different category that's separated by the disjunctive, we have mail matter is the first category, and there's no dispute as to what that means.","start":394.261,"stop":404.055,"duration":9.79},{"text":"There's a long history of case law and a pedigree which goes all the way back to 1792 that regards this particular part of the statute, or \"any money\".","start":404.055,"stop":415.683,"duration":11.63},{"text":"What was it that \"any money\" means?","start":415.683,"stop":418.485,"duration":2.8},{"text":"Surely, if the category has to stand by itself, then","start":418.485,"stop":424.87,"duration":6.38},{"text":"is not going to be used to modify \"any money\".","start":424.87,"stop":428.333,"duration":3.46},{"text":"We don't have a situation here where the plain reading of the statute says that","start":428.333,"stop":433.015,"duration":4.68},{"text":"\"any money of the United States. \"","start":433.015,"stop":435.158,"duration":2.14},{"text":"We also have a situation where it would have made \"any money\" a redundant statement.","start":435.158,"stop":440.762,"duration":5.6},{"text":"As in Section 2112 of the United States Code in Title 18, robbery of government property has been ruled quite conclusively to include government money.","start":440.762,"stop":454.178,"duration":13.42},{"text":"The only purpose that Congress could have had for putting \"any money\" as a separate clause was that they were contemplating that there would be other money over which Congress could assert jurisdiction that was not government property.","start":454.178,"stop":469.058,"duration":14.88},{"text":"And I submit to the Court that what they were discussing and what they contemplated was the money which would be in the possession of those who would normally possess mail matter.","start":469.058,"stop":479.935,"duration":10.88},{"text":"Material other than mail matter the statute was designed to protect.","start":479.935,"stop":486.289,"duration":6.35},{"text":"And there's another way when you look at the statute as a whole that this type of an argument and this type of ambiguity begins to make more and more sense.","start":486.289,"stop":496.517,"duration":10.23},{"text":"Before we get to the articles which a lawful custodian would have custody of... the mail matter or any money or other property of the United States... we have the situation of a... who is a lawful custodian of these... these properties.","start":496.517,"stop":516.009,"duration":19.49},{"text":"Again, this is a statute which has been around for a long time.","start":516.009,"stop":522.084,"duration":6.07},{"text":"Case law has been established as to a lawful custodian of mail matter.","start":522.084,"stop":527.756,"duration":5.67},{"text":"Lawful custodians... different courts have... have looked at the... at postal regulations, different courts have looked at private business people who run a post office on a contractual basis and ruled that those people are in... in custody of mail matter.","start":527.756,"stop":544.558,"duration":16.8},{"text":"The courts have... have ruled on this issue.","start":544.558,"stop":548.69,"duration":4.13},{"text":"Congress is presumed to have known what the precedents were when it added these... these other categories to mail matter or any money or other property of the United States.","start":548.69,"stop":560.578,"duration":11.89},{"text":"They knew what a lawful custodian of these matters were, and there's no indication in the statute that they intended to set up any other standard for determining what it was that constituted a lawful custodian.","start":560.578,"stop":575.868,"duration":15.29},{"text":"Now, the petitioners contend that these types of problems are all based... and really the reason why we are here before this Court is because the Government was able to convince the Eleventh Circuit, of course, that there was only two clauses with the \"or\".","start":575.868,"stop":593.871,"duration":18},{"text":"But if you look at the opinion below, which we have petitioned this Court to review, you will see that there is a major glaring mistake that was made in that opinion.","start":593.871,"stop":607.14,"duration":13.27},{"text":"And that is that the writer of that opinion presumed that there was a comma between the words \"mail matter\" and the clause","start":607.14,"stop":619.636,"duration":12.5},{"text":"And, in fact, the United States Code does not contain a comma in that place.","start":619.636,"stop":625.22,"duration":5.58},{"text":"There is no separation in the two categories.","start":625.22,"stop":627.841,"duration":2.62},{"text":"The separation is into three categories under a plain meaning of the statute.","start":627.841,"stop":633.875,"duration":6.03},{"text":"Now, going back to the analysis of what kind of any money they were talking about and other government property, we now see that Congress must have intended when reading the statute in its plain and unambiguous fashion that somehow the various phrases would be related to each other; that the different categories that the Congress was intending to protect would be related to each other.","start":633.875,"stop":662.786,"duration":28.91}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day
