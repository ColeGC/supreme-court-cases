box.","start":544.316,"stop":544.799,"duration":0.48},{"text":"We think that the suitcases and the bandaid box were all searched pursuant to the automobile exception rule in Ross and of course the more recent case announced by this Court, United States versus Johns.","start":544.799,"stop":553.854,"duration":9.06},{"text":"We also feel that the bandaid box was properly searched as a search incident to a lawful custodial arrest under the doctrines of this Court in United States versus Robinson and New York versus Belton.","start":553.854,"stop":565.012,"duration":11.16},{"text":"It is the state's position that the officers had probable cause to believe that the vehicle in question contained contraband, and that a search of the entire vehicle for drugs was justified by the facts.","start":565.012,"stop":576.22,"duration":11.21},{"text":"The fact that checkout time was at hand, that the baggage had been loaded into the car, that the informant had stated that some... that one of the suitcases contained drugs, that a strong odor of marijuana was coming from the trunk, coupled with the actions of the defendant Castleberry and the third party as Officer Taylor approached the car, all support the belief that the drugs had been removed from somewhere in the motel room and were now somewhere in the vehicle.","start":576.22,"stop":604.037,"duration":27.82},{"text":"Therefore, the entire automobile could have been a hideaway for the drugs.","start":604.037,"stop":607.922,"duration":3.88},{"text":"This Court specifically held in the Johns case that when the officers approached the trucks in question and detected the distinct odor of marijuana which was around the back of the truck, they had probable cause to search the entire truck.","start":607.922,"stop":620.98,"duration":13.06},{"text":"The Court in Johns stated also that the officers in the Ross case had probable cause to search the entire vehicle in that case.","start":620.98,"stop":629.836,"duration":8.86},{"text":"The state believes that the facts in this case present an even more compelling case involving probable cause.","start":629.836,"stop":635.155,"duration":5.32},{"text":"In this case, the convictions of the defendant were reversed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in a two-to-one decision.","start":635.155,"stop":641.476,"duration":6.32},{"text":"The court stated the reason why they reversed was because they felt like if an officer had tried to apply the Ross and the Sanders and the Chadwick doctrine, they felt like that taking all those cases together, that if an officer knows of the specific location within a vehicle where contraband is located, the officer should get a search warrant.","start":641.476,"stop":661.973,"duration":20.5},{"text":"However, if he only knows that there is contraband generally in the vehicle, the officer can go ahead and search it without a warrant.","start":661.973,"stop":669.477,"duration":7.5},{"text":"The court held in this case since the suitcases and the bandaid box were suspected locations of contraband, they should have been detained while the search warrant was being obtained.","start":669.477,"stop":680.101,"duration":10.62},{"text":"However, in the Johns case, the Court observed that when the officers detected the odor of marijuana coming from the back of the trucks, they no doubt suspected that the odor was coming from the packages which were in the back of the truck, but the Court, of course, in that case did not require a search warrant.","start":680.101,"stop":695.878,"duration":15.78},{"text":"In Ross, the police were advised of the specific location of drugs in that case.","start":695.878,"stop":700.596,"duration":4.72},{"text":"In that case they were advised by an informant that the drugs were in the trunk, but this Court upheld the search of the brown paper bag and the zippered pouch in the trunk of the car without requiring a search warrant.","start":700.596,"stop":714.504,"duration":13.91},{"text":"Under the same rationale, the search of the suitcases found in the trunk in the present case should be upheld.","start":714.504,"stop":720.724,"duration":6.22},{"text":"The rule announced by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals we feel means that there would now be endless litigation over whether or not the police suspected of a particular location of contraband within a particular container in a vehicle.","start":720.724,"stop":736.519,"duration":15.79},{"text":"Furthermore, this Court in Johns specifically noted that the fact that a container is involved does not in itself either expand or contract the well-established exception to the warrant principle recognized in the Carroll case.","start":736.519,"stop":748.16,"duration":11.64},{"text":"In Ross this Court stated that there was no distinction between containers and compartments, and that the object of the search is limited... and that the officer's search is limited only by the object of the search, and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that that object may be found.","start":748.16,"stop":765.704,"duration":17.54},{"text":"In both Ross and Johns and in Justice Powell's concurring opinion in the Robins case it was noted that in neither Sanders nor in the Chadwick case did the police have probable cause to search the vehicle or anything in it other than the footlocker in the Chadwick case and

that.","start":793.706,"stop":795.391,"duration":1.68},{"text":"Of course, we think that on the basis of the Carroll search, where, as you pointed out in the Ross case, the police ripped open the upholstery in the back seat of the car, that that would have been proper, but there is no record there was anything like that done.","start":795.391,"stop":807.281,"duration":11.89},{"text":"The
