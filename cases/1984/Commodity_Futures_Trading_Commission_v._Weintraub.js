Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":67.025,"stop":69.827,"duration":2.8},{"text":"The question in this case is who is the proper party to control the attorney-client privilege of a corporation in bankruptcy.","start":69.827,"stop":78.166,"duration":8.34},{"text":"Our position is straightforward: Control over the privilege rests with the corporation's management.","start":78.166,"stop":84.487,"duration":6.32},{"text":"The bankruptcy trustee manages the debtor corporation and therefore the trustee must have the power to assert or waive the corporation's privilege.","start":84.487,"stop":94.712,"duration":10.23},{"text":"This case arises out of the demise of a commodity brokerage firm, Chicago Discount Commodity Brokers.","start":94.712,"stop":102.032,"duration":7.32},{"text":"Over a period of time, the firm's President, Frank McGhee, who is one of the Respondents in this Court, had embezzled several million dollars in customer funds.","start":102.032,"stop":112.256,"duration":10.22},{"text":"And by the fall of 1980 the firm's finances were in such disarray that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission filed a complaint in federal court alleging various violations of the Commodities Exchange Act, and the same day that the complaint was filed the brokerage firm, through Frank McGhee, who was at that time its sole remaining officer and director, entered into a consent decree with the Commission that provided for the appointment of a receiver.","start":112.256,"stop":142.193,"duration":29.94},{"text":"John Notz was appointed the receiver and he immediately took control of the firm's operations.","start":142.193,"stop":148.446,"duration":6.25},{"text":"It quickly became clear to him that really the best course for the firm was to file for bankruptcy and, pursuant to an express authorization in the consent decree, he filed a voluntary petition for liquidation under subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code.","start":148.446,"stop":167.141,"duration":18.69},{"text":"Now, subchapter IV of chapter 7 is the only bankruptcy avenue available to commodity brokers.","start":167.141,"stop":173.978,"duration":6.84},{"text":"They cannot go into reorganization.","start":173.978,"stop":176.164,"duration":2.19},{"text":"Congress had two concerns when it set forth that requirement.","start":176.164,"stop":181.818,"duration":5.65},{"text":"The first is with the customers of a commodity broker, whose funds are primarily at risk.","start":181.818,"stop":187.971,"duration":6.15},{"text":"They are the people that put up the margin payments and the deposits, and it's typically that money that is lost in a commodity brokerage bankruptcy.","start":187.971,"stop":195.927,"duration":7.96},{"text":"Congress was also concerned that the bankruptcy of one commodity broker not have a ripple effect through the complex and interdependent commodity markets and thereby cause problems throughout the futures markets.","start":195.927,"stop":210.17,"duration":14.24},{"text":"So under these special provisions the trustee, who was Mr. Notz, came in and he operated the commodity brokerage business with a view toward liquidating it and closing out its contracts in an orderly fashion as quickly as possible.","start":210.17,"stop":227.548,"duration":17.38},{"text":"Pursuant to Section 766 of the code, the trustee in a commodity broker bankruptcy must identify contracts that may be transferred to solvent commodity brokers, he must seek customer instructions, he must make and meet margin payments daily, he must be prepared to accept or to deliver commodities in contracts that cannot be closed out before their closing dates.","start":227.548,"stop":255.116,"duration":27.57}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Kuhlik, I'm curious about how this process would work.","start":255.116,"stop":260.77,"duration":5.65},{"text":"Assuming that you are correct ultimately that a trustee in bankruptcy has the power to waive the privilege for the corporation, is that limited in any way?","start":260.77,"stop":274.01,"duration":13.24},{"text":"In other words, is that qualified by a power to waive it if it will somehow benefit the estate?","start":274.01,"stop":284.551,"duration":10.54},{"text":"And if so, is it somehow necessary that the trustee would find out first what it is that's going to be waived before making that decision, and how would that be accomplished?","start":284.551,"stop":300.078,"duration":15.53}]},{"speakerName":"Bruce Neil Kuhlik","textObjs":[{"text":"You ask a number of questions, Justice O'Connor.","start":300.078,"stop":302.197,"duration":2.12},{"text":"The trustee in a bankruptcy is a fiduciary who has a responsibility to all of the parties in interest in the proceeding: the creditors, the shareholders, the debtor corporation.","start":302.197,"stop":313.254,"duration":11.06},{"text":"And it is open to any party at any time to challenge the actions of the trustee as not being in the best interests of the estate.","start":313.254,"stop":322.86,"duration":9.61},{"text":"In fact, it's a fairly common occurrence.","start":322.86,"stop":324.643,"duration":1.78},{"text":"People are doing it all the time.","start":324.643,"stop":325.976,"duration":1.33},{"text":"So in a sense, the rule we are asking for is a presumptive one.","start":325.976,"stop":331.297,"duration":5.32},{"text":"We feel that the trustee is the best person in the first instance to make this cut.","start":331.297,"stop":337.367,"duration":6.07},{"text":"He is obviously in a better position in this case than Frank McGhee.","start":337.367,"stop":341.236,"duration":3.87}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, wouldn't the trustee have to know what the communication was before deciding

that the McGhee's have asserted the privilege or instructed their attorney to assert it with respect to the trustee as well.","start":348.341,"stop":360.482,"duration":12.14},{"text":"In this particular case, the trustee had been pursuing a number of adversary actions and the CFTC had as well, and the trustee and the CFTC were both aware that the McGhee's were the people who had primarily caused the problems with this brokerage firm.","start":360.482,"stop":380.626,"duration":20.14},{"text":"And it was quite apparent to the trustee that waiver of the privilege in favor of the CFTC with respect to the questions that were asked of Mr. Weintraub in this deposition would be in everybody's best interest.","start":380.626,"stop":394.62,"duration":13.99},{"text":"But I would emphasize here that this proceeding arises out of the subpoena enforcement action.","start":394.62,"stop":400.44,"duration":5.82}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, how does the trustee know that without knowing what the information was?","start":400.44,"stop":404.844,"duration":4.4}]},{"speakerName":"Bruce Neil Kuhlik","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, he knows in this case from his experience in pursuing other actions against the McGhee's and other insiders, that information concerning access to the safe, loans to corporate officers and the like, very, very unlikely that they would redound to the detriment of the estate.","start":404.844,"stop":426.591,"duration":21.75},{"text":"And what we're talking about here is a question of whether this will be in the best interest of the customers, the creditors, the shareholders.","start":426.591,"stop":435.363,"duration":8.77},{"text":"The questions that were asked of Mr. Weintraub with respect to which the privilege was asserted were questions that could not possibly have hurt those groups of people.","start":435.363,"stop":445.319,"duration":9.96},{"text":"The only people that could have been harmed were the insiders who engaged... had engaged in fraudulent transactions.","start":445.319,"stop":452.408,"duration":7.09},{"text":"I would emphasize here that the CFTC is statutorily authorized to seek disgorgement of ill-gotten gains in a proceeding such as this.","start":452.408,"stop":462.68,"duration":10.27},{"text":"So it was quite apparent to the trustee that the CFTC was seeking to go along the same lines that he himself was, which was to find the money.","start":462.68,"stop":471.167,"duration":8.49},{"text":"The customers had put up these funds for margin payments, for deposits, and this money was supposed to be separated... \"segregated\" is the word that's used in the statute... and not used for any other sort of trading.","start":471.167,"stop":482.808,"duration":11.64},{"text":"And what happened here was that Mr. McGhee and perhaps other insiders had used this money to trade on their own accounts, and it was quite apparent that the only way this money was going to be recovered was to determine where it had gone, what the insiders had done with it.","start":482.808,"stop":499.353,"duration":16.55},{"text":"And I would emphasize, though, again that this is a subpoena enforcement action.","start":499.353,"stop":504.007,"duration":4.65},{"text":"If the McGhee's had wished to challenge the propriety of the trustee's waiver, there was a place for them to do it and that was in the bankruptcy court, not in the subpoena enforcement court.","start":504.007,"stop":515.196,"duration":11.19}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"And what procedures are there in the bankruptcy court to do that?","start":515.196,"stop":521.683,"duration":6.49}]},{"speakerName":"Bruce Neil Kuhlik","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, at any time, Justice O'Connor, anyone may file a motion with the bankruptcy judge alleging that the trustee has violated his fiduciary duty, has not acted in the best interest of the estate.","start":521.683,"stop":535.158,"duration":13.48},{"text":"The trustee, of course, has to file a bond at the beginning of the action and he is constantly subject to supervision.","start":535.158,"stop":541.494,"duration":6.34},{"text":"So that procedure would clearly be available here or would have been available had they chosen to--","start":541.494,"stop":548.75,"duration":7.26}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

is the power of the trustee to waive the privilege limited to matters concerning the estate's claims and assets?","start":633.939,"stop":642.877,"duration":8.94}]},{"speakerName":"Bruce Neil

assets.","start":642.877,"stop":652.15,"duration":9.27}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think it's conceivable that there might be some that aren't

corporation.","start":657.202,"stop":665.041,"duration":7.84},{"text":"That is clearly implicit in everything that the trustee is given the power to do in the bankruptcy code.","start":665.041,"stop":672.397,"duration":7.36},{"text":"And as I say, if the trustee in a particular case has not acted in the best interest of everybody, that action may be challenged.","start":672.397,"stop":680.318,"duration":7.92},{"text":"The trustee in this case, like other liquidation trustees, has the duty to maximize the value of the estate for all of the parties in interest.","start":680.318,"stop":690.608,"duration":10.29},{"text":"The estate in a corporate bankruptcy is composed of all of the corporation's property.","start":690.608,"stop":696.762,"duration":6.15},{"text":"Unlike an individual, a corporation doesn't have any exempt property.","start":696.762,"stop":700.897,"duration":4.14},{"text":"Everything goes into the estate.","start":700.897,"stop":703.349,"duration":2.45},{"text":"And most significantly perhaps, the estate includes the corporation's causes of action, its litigation.","start":703.349,"stop":710.689,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Under Section 541 of the code and under bankruptcy rule 6009, the trustee takes control of the corporation's litigation, both its causes of action and its defenses.","start":710.689,"stop":724.162,"duration":13.47},{"text":"And it would be completely anomalous to suppose that the person who is in control of the corporation's litigation does not have the power to obtain and to control its communications with counsel.","start":724.162,"stop":739.772,"duration":15.61},{"text":"It's simply impossible to see how his function in prosecuting causes of action could be carried out without access to that information.","start":739.772,"stop":748.862,"duration":9.09},{"text":"And in this very case, I would note that the trustee has filed over time approximately 75 adversary actions seeking the recovery of approximately $6 million.","start":748.862,"stop":760.253,"duration":11.39},{"text":"Because in bankruptcy proceedings the resources of the estate are often quite limited, it would not be unusual for a trustee to cooperate with the Government where, as here, it is apparent that the Government is looking for the same thing that the trustee is, which is the missing money.","start":760.253,"stop":778.999,"duration":18.75},{"text":"And just that sort of cooperation as we've been discussing was contemplated here.","start":778.999,"stop":784.653,"duration":5.65},{"text":"And after the trustee, at the CFTC's request, waived the privilege, the district court ruled that he must answer the questions and the McGhee's, Frank McGhee who I've mentioned and his brother Andrew McGhee, who was a minority shareholder in the firm and a former officer, appealed to the Seventh Circuit, and the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the trustee does not have the power, absolutely doesn't have the power, to waive the corporation's attorney-client privilege.","start":784.653,"stop":817.291,"duration":32.64},{"text":"This conflicts with decisions of the Second, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits and virtually every district and bankruptcy court to consider the question.","start":817.291,"stop":825.278,"duration":7.99},{"text":"Now, our position really can be summarized in a nutshell: The privilege of a corporation is controlled by its management, its board of directors or its officers if they're authorized to so act by the board.","start":825.278,"stop":838.705,"duration":13.43},{"text":"When a new board of directors takes over in a non-bankruptcy case as a result of a takeover or a merger, shareholder dissatisfaction or the like, it takes control of the privilege.","start":838.705,"stop":849.845,"duration":11.14},{"text":"It has access to the privileged communications.","start":849.845,"stop":852.045,"duration":2.2},{"text":"It can waive the privilege.","start":852.045,"stop":853.731,"duration":1.69},{"text":"That much is settled corporate law and it's undisputed by the parties here.","start":853.731,"stop":858.801,"duration":5.07},{"text":"So the question is who manages a debtor corporation in bankruptcy when a trustee has been appointed.","start":858.801,"stop":866.289,"duration":7.49},{"text":"There can really only be one answer: It's the trustee.","start":866.289,"stop":869.307,"duration":3.02},{"text":"As I've noted, the trustee has power to exercise... can exercise power over all of the corporate property.","start":869.307,"stop":878.263,"duration":8.96},{"text":"He's under the direct supervision of the bankruptcy court in this regard.","start":878.263,"stop":882.317,"duration":4.05},{"text":"He operates the business in a commodity brokerage bankruptcy.","start":882.317,"stop":886.018,"duration":3.7},{"text":"He can operate the business in other liquidations, with the approval of the court.","start":886.018,"stop":891.006,"duration":4.99},{"text":"He has a specific duty to investigate former management to reveal causes of action, to set aside preferential transfers and fraudulent conveyances.","start":891.006,"stop":901.378,"duration":10.37},{"text":"As I've said, he stands in the shoes of the debtor corporation in prosecuting and defending its causes of action.","start":901.378,"stop":907.682,"duration":6.3},{"text":"We don't think he could do any of these things without--","start":907.682,"stop":911.42,"duration":3.74}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Kuhlik, do you think the same rule would apply in an individual

answer?","start":931.231,"stop":932.833,"duration":1.6}]},{"speakerName":"Bruce Neil Kuhlik","textObjs":[{"text":"My answer is that that is a question that does not have to be decided

result.","start":953.763,"stop":960.067,"duration":6.3},{"text":"But my main point is that whatever the Court does here will not require a result one way or the other in an individual
