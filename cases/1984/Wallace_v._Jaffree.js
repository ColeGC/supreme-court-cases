this desire to pray, but it does so in a way that in no way interferes with the free exercise of rights of anyone else in the class.","start":503.661,"stop":525.741,"duration":22.08},{"text":"It does

leave to the teacher a certain discretion in the sense that this statute is permissive.","start":532.911,"stop":541.684,"duration":8.77},{"text":"It says that a teacher may implement this minute of silence.","start":541.684,"stop":547.088,"duration":5.4},{"text":"This statute, however, is not inconsistent with the notion that local school boards in their independent areas would or could adopt regulations dealing with the implementation of the statute.","start":547.088,"stop":559.045,"duration":11.96},{"text":"But the sense of the statute is that this moment of silence should be allowed for students who wish to have their religious needs accommodated during the day.","start":559.045,"stop":568.936,"duration":9.89},{"text":"We see no difference constitutionally between a statute which is

questions.","start":568.936,"stop":584.363,"duration":15.43},{"text":"We have from the 24 states that have moment of silence statutes, we have a variety of language in those
