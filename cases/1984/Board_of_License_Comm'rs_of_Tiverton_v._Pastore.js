see whether they are carrying out their operations within the parameters of the law, and for other reasons.","start":198.195,"stop":225.262,"duration":27.07},{"text":"This was in fact acknowledged by

bar.","start":304.632,"stop":324.878,"duration":20.25},{"text":"The bar owners appealed.","start":324.878,"stop":326.362,"duration":1.48},{"text":"Initially they appealed, as it provided by Rhode

grounds.","start":326.362,"stop":339.836,"duration":13.47},{"text":"The town then appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court which, for the first time, raised the issue of whether the exclusionary rule should have been applied to an administrative hearing, and held that in fact the Liquor License Administrator, for the wrong reasons, but nevertheless, was correct in vacating the revoking of the license.","start":339.836,"stop":364.737,"duration":24.9},{"text":"The town therefore appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.","start":364.737,"stop":370.372,"duration":5.63},{"text":"The Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's holding that evidence of stolen property obtained pursuant to an invalid warrant and suppressed already for criminal purposes, should not have been admissible at a liquor license hearing.","start":370.372,"stop":385.901,"duration":15.53},{"text":"This did this I believe on three bases.","start":385.901,"stop":387.734,"duration":1.83},{"text":"They indicated very clearly in their decision an unwillingness to dilute the deterrent effects of the exclusionary rule on police misconduct by allowing illegally obtained evidence to be admitted at such an administrative hearing.","start":387.734,"stop":403.462,"duration":15.73},{"text":"They also did it by analogizing this administrative hearing, liquor license revocation hearing, to a so-called quasi-criminal hearing.","start":403.462,"stop":411.699,"duration":8.24},{"text":"They called it quasi-criminal in character and therefore said that just as the exclusionary rule is applied to criminal hearings, so should it be applied to quasi-criminal hearings such as this.","start":411.699,"stop":423.34,"duration":11.64},{"text":"And they finally found an insufficient societal interest in the control of liquor-serving establishments to justify a different finding from the one that they had made.","start":423.34,"stop":437.166,"duration":13.83},{"text":"We believe that the Rhode Island Supreme Court should be reversed on each of these grounds: first, on the ground of deterrence.","start":437.166,"stop":444.689,"duration":7.52},{"text":"I believe that this court in Janis has commented on the uncertainty as to whether the exclusionary rule in fact deters police from improper searches and seizures.","start":444.689,"stop":457.58,"duration":12.89},{"text":"It was suggested I believe in that decision that where there has already been criminal exclusion of suppressed evidence, that that is enough, that that is a sufficient sharp medicine, if you will, strong medicine, enacted against a local police, that that is enough to just... enough exclusion in that case.","start":457.58,"stop":481.528,"duration":23.95},{"text":"I would argue that exclusion has already occurred here.","start":481.528,"stop":485.664,"duration":4.14},{"text":"The evidence that was obtained by the Tiverton police has already been excluded from a criminal proceeding.","start":485.664,"stop":492.92,"duration":7.26},{"text":"Therefore, there has been a sufficient penalty enforced against the Tiverton police to justify the deterrent purposes of that rule.","start":492.92,"stop":504.311,"duration":11.39},{"text":"Moreover, this exclusion occurred at a criminal hearing which I would argue that criminal hearing, that criminal charge was the Tiverton police's zone of primary interest.","start":504.311,"stop":520.153,"duration":15.84},{"text":"I would admit that under the standards that were brought forth by this Court in Janis, that this probably qualifies as an intrasovereign situation on its bare facts.","start":520.153,"stop":533.33,"duration":13.18},{"text":"I would, however, argue that despite this being an intrasovereign situation, so to speak, that despite their probable employment status, the chief zone of primary interest for these Tiverton police officers entering the bar on that March evening was a criminal offense and not a licensing offense.","start":533.33,"stop":556.962,"duration":23.63},{"text":"And I believe this
