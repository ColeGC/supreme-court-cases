may recall to the Court that 14(d) also prescribes the necessity for a tender offer to contain full information, and the Commission has issued tons of regulations under 14(d) requiring full disclosure.","start":755.5,"stop":769.992,"duration":14.49},{"text":"But in 14(e)... and I only quote two of those regulations... it requires, first, that the tender offer be kept open for 20 business

promptly.","start":769.992,"stop":792.025,"duration":22.03},{"text":"And neither of those subdivisions have anything whatever to do with the necessity for full disclosure or the

percent subscribed tender offer, not because of any event which had occurred outside but solely by virtue of the intervention of the El Paso management to induce Burlington Northern to make a better deal for the El Paso management and caused a new offer to be made under more restrictive terms in the sense of less shares, while tying up the stock, the balance of the stock needed to obtain control so that no one else, no other white knight would come in and offer a competitive bid, that manipulated the situation vis-a-vis the El Paso
