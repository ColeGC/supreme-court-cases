so?","start":204.357,"stop":205.729,"duration":1.37},{"text":"First of all, I think it is quite clear that the due process clause does not restrict Congress's authority to change the level of food stamp benefits.","start":205.729,"stop":215.153,"duration":9.42},{"text":"A food stamp recipient has a property interest in receiving the level of benefits specified by law at any particular time.","start":215.153,"stop":224.472,"duration":9.32},{"text":"The recipient doesn't have a property interest in getting any greater benefits, and the recipient doesn't have a vested interest in getting future benefits.","start":224.472,"stop":232.216,"duration":7.74},{"text":"So, if Congress amends the law and reduces benefits, as it did in 1981, it does not deprive the recipient of property.","start":232.216,"stop":239.94,"duration":7.72},{"text":"It merely redefines the recipient's property interest.","start":239.94,"stop":243.713,"duration":3.77},{"text":"Now, since the plaintiffs in this case, who were food stamp recipients, had no vested interest in continuing to receive benefits at the pre-1981 level, one may well ask on what theory they claimed that implementation of the 1981 reduction deprived them of property and triggered the due process clause.","start":243.713,"stop":265.569,"duration":21.86},{"text":"And their theory, as I understand it, is as follows.","start":265.569,"stop":268.448,"duration":2.88},{"text":"First, they correctly note that they have a property interest in getting the right amount of benefits.","start":268.448,"stop":274.352,"duration":5.9},{"text":"Then they say this interest is threatened when the law is changed, because the risk of administrative accident in calculating benefits increases at this time of confusion, and therefore they say we are entitled to advance notice explaining to us how our new benefit level was calculated so that we can double check the state's computation.","start":274.352,"stop":295.016,"duration":20.66},{"text":"Now, the first thing that is wrong with this theory in our view is the premise that a great risk of administrative error occurs when a simple mathematical change like that enacted in 1981 is implemented.","start":295.016,"stop":310.088,"duration":15.07},{"text":"This premise is devoid of empirical support, and it is intuitively incorrect.","start":310.088,"stop":313.748,"duration":3.66},{"text":"This is a simple mathematical operation, and it does not give rise to a great risk of error, but assuming that it is correct for the sake of argument, let me briefly explore some of the implications of this theory.","start":313.748,"stop":326.828,"duration":13.08},{"text":"First of all, for all the talk about reductions in food stamp benefits, it turns out that it doesn't matter under this theory that benefits were reduced in 1981.","start":326.828,"stop":336.043,"duration":9.22},{"text":"All that matters is that the law was changed, and therefore plaintiffs claimed the risk of error increased, so the theory would logically apply just as well if Congress had increased benefits in 1981 or if it had simply made some other alteration in the formula for computing benefits.","start":336.043,"stop":354.076,"duration":18.03},{"text":"Second, it is clear that this theory extends far beyond food stamps, and let me give just two examples.","start":354.076,"stop":360.979,"duration":6.9},{"text":"A state decides to increase the salaries of its employees to reflect an increase in the cost of living.","start":360.979,"stop":368.295,"duration":7.32},{"text":"State employees have a property interest in getting the salaries specified by law.","start":368.295,"stop":373.138,"duration":4.84},{"text":"A Change in the pay scale is a mass change in the law, so according to the plaintiffs that increases the risk of administrative error.","start":373.138,"stop":380.252,"duration":7.11},{"text":"So under their theory state employees are entitled to advanced notice as a constitutional requirement explaining how their new salaries were calculated.","start":380.252,"stop":388.978,"duration":8.73},{"text":"Another example.","start":388.978,"stop":390.838,"duration":1.86},{"text":"Tax rates have been charged several times in recent years.","start":390.838,"stop":394.231,"duration":3.39},{"text":"This has affected the amount withheld from wages.","start":394.231,"stop":397.924,"duration":3.69},{"text":"Wage earners have a property interest in their wages.","start":397.924,"stop":400.215,"duration":2.29},{"text":"Charging the tax rates is a mass change in the law, so under the plaintiff's theory, wage earners were entitled to advanced notice specifying how their new wage levels were calculated.","start":400.215,"stop":412.954,"duration":12.74},{"text":"And I think plaintiffs' theory goes further still, because what really triggers, what directly triggers the due process clause under that theory is not the change in the law but the increase in the risk of administrative error.","start":412.954,"stop":426.081,"duration":13.13},{"text":"So what if the risk increases for some other reason?","start":426.081,"stop":429.076,"duration":3},{"text":"The state gets a new computer program, gets a new computer.","start":429.076,"stop":432.146,"duration":3.07},{"text":"There is a fire at the computer center.","start":432.146,"stop":434.429,"duration":2.28},{"text":"Logically the theory should apply there as well, but then I am not even sure why an increase in the risk of error should matter.","start":434.429,"stop":441.733,"duration":7.3},{"text":"What if the normal, everyday error rate in a non-computerized state is higher than even the increased error rate in a state like Massachusetts when it implements a change in the law?","start":441.733,"stop":453.931,"duration":12.2},{"text":"Is the non-computerized state then under some kind of perpetual duty to give out notice every time it issues a check?","start":453.931,"stop":460.035,"duration":6.1},{"text":"All of this, of course, is absurd.","start":460.035,"stop":462.757,"duration":2.72},{"text":"The due process clause requires notice and a hearing when there is a real and imminent threat to a property or liberty interest.","start":462.757,"stop":471.431,"duration":8.67},{"text":"Now, there is such a threat in the Goldberg versus Kelly situation.","start":471.431,"stop":475.575,"duration":4.14},{"text":"The state makes a factual finding about the individual and concludes that the individual is ineligible for benefits, but there is no such threat here.","start":475.575,"stop":485.332,"duration":9.76},{"text":"The only threat is the statistical chance that an accident is going to happen, but for all of us there is always the chance that the government is going to accidentally deprive us of life, liberty, or property.","start":485.332,"stop":498.75,"duration":13.42},{"text":"The elevator in this building may crash, but that does not mean that we all have a due process right to advance notice and a hearing on the issue of elevator maintenance.","start":498.75,"stop":508.845,"duration":10.1},{"text":"Respondents... the plaintiffs in this case have the last word on this constitutional question in their reply brief, and it seems to me that they ended up by conceding virtually everything that I have just said.","start":508.845,"stop":526.099,"duration":17.25},{"text":"On Page 11 of their reply brief, they write,","start":526.099,"stop":528.752,"duration":2.65},{"text":"\"By definition, accidental deprivations of property by the government cannot be predicted, and therefore advanced notice of them is not possible, much less required. \"","start":528.752,"stop":541.219,"duration":12.47},{"text":"\"This reality, however, does not lead to the conclusion that no notice is due when the government intends to deprive one of property and will predictably make mistakes in doing so. \"","start":541.219,"stop":552.428,"duration":11.21},{"text":"But here, neither Massachusetts nor the federal government intended to deprive anybody of property.","start":552.428,"stop":558.111,"duration":5.68},{"text":"What they intended to do was to see that every recipient got exactly the level of benefits voted by Congress in 1981, no more and no less.","start":558.111,"stop":569.209,"duration":11.1},{"text":"The plaintiffs in this case are worried only about accidental deprivation of property, but in the case of such accidental occurrences, advanced notice in a hearing is not necessary.","start":569.209,"stop":581.868,"duration":12.66},{"text":"Post-deprivation proceedings are fully sufficient, as
