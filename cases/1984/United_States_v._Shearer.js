it barred claims in respect of the detention of goods by Customs officials.","start":516.9,"stop":527.022,"duration":10.12},{"text":"And the Court said that in respect of has the same broad and all-encompassing meaning that words such as 2680(h), have.","start":527.022,"stop":538.23,"duration":11.21},{"text":"And therefore, the Court said that Congress intended to bar suits against the United States, in the Court's words, in any way associated with the detention of goods, including the plaintiff's claim in Kosak.","start":538.23,"stop":552.239,"duration":14.01},{"text":"There's no reason why Section 2680(h) should be given a narrower reading than Section 2680(c).","start":552.239,"stop":559.993,"duration":7.75},{"text":"Section 2680(h) has the arising out of language that the Court in Kosak analogized Section 2680(c) to.","start":559.993,"stop":568.249,"duration":8.26},{"text":"Therefore, we think in light of the Court's decision in Kosak, Section 2680(h) has to bar claims that are in any way associated with an assault and battery by a federal employee.","start":568.249,"stop":581.073,"duration":12.82},{"text":"In fact, the way that the court of appeals construed Section 2680(h) is really quite perverse, because what the court of appeals essentially said is that the only species of claim that it bars is a claim trying to hold the United States liable on a respondeat superior basis for the intentional torts of its employees.","start":581.073,"stop":603.32,"duration":22.25},{"text":"But there really was very little reason why Congress should have been concerned when it passed the Tort Claims Act in 1946 that the United States would be held liable on a respondeat superior basis for intentional torts, because it was very unusual in 1946, and it's still unusual today, for an employer to be held liable on a respondeat superior basis for the intentional torts of its employees.","start":603.32,"stop":629.285,"duration":25.96},{"text":"And Congress had already put into Section 1346(b)--","start":629.285,"stop":633.172,"duration":3.89}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

been told of the injured person... that is, as the prison guard vis-a-vis the prisoner, as compared with the prison guard, for example, meeting somebody in a local bar and committing an assault or killing him, as was the case here?","start":633.172,"stop":672.047,"duration":38.88}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"--We would think, Mr. Chief Justice, that both suits would be barred if the cause of action was dependent upon proving an intentional tort by a federal employee.","start":672.047,"stop":683.355,"duration":11.31},{"text":"And in both of your hypotheticals I think that would be the case.","start":683.355,"stop":687.823,"duration":4.47},{"text":"In other words, we don't think it matters whether the federal employee was acting within the scope of his employment of not.","start":687.823,"stop":694.544,"duration":6.72},{"text":"If it is essential to the plaintiff's case to prove an intentional tort by a federal employee, we think Congress meant to foreclose suits against the United States under 2680(h).","start":694.544,"stop":707.386,"duration":12.84},{"text":"However, we don't believe that it necessarily would extend to suits challenging intentional torts by non-employees such as I discussed with Justice Stevens.","start":707.386,"stop":718.944,"duration":11.56},{"text":"So as I was saying, the only thing that would be covered by the Third Circuit's construction of Section 2680(h) are respondeat superior claims, but that was really not a problem that Congress could have been concerned about in 1946.","start":718.944,"stop":734.121,"duration":15.18},{"text":"If it had locked at the reported cases involving intentional torts by employees, it would have seen that most of those suits alleged a negligent supervision theory, and yet, there's nothing in the language or legislative history of the intentional tort exception to suggest that Congress meant to foreclose suits based on the really less likely theory, which is respondeat superior, and allow the United States to be sued on the more likely theory, which is negligent supervision.","start":734.121,"stop":763.223,"duration":29.1},{"text":"And I think that Congress' amendment of the Tort Claims Act, the intentional tort exception, in 1974 confirms this common understanding of the clause, because as the Court is aware, Congress amended the Tort Claims Act in 1974 to allow the United States to be sued for the intentional torts of law enforcement officers.","start":763.223,"stop":785.053,"duration":21.83},{"text":"And that amendment followed a series of well-publicized episodes in which law enforcement officers, primarily drug agents, had engaged in illegal searches and seizures, no-knock raids, and illegal arrests.","start":785.053,"stop":800.663,"duration":15.61},{"text":"If there was any species of claim in which it would be plausible or would have been plausible to hold the United States liable on a negligence supervision theory, that was it, because the evidence showed that many of these illegal raids had been carried out by the same drug officials or the same drug offices.","start":800.663,"stop":819.042,"duration":18.38},{"text":"And yet, the legislative history of the 1974 amendments are quite clear that Congress amended the act based on the assumption, which was shared by everyone and disputed by no one, that prior to the amendment in 1974 the United States could not have been sued by the victims of those raids because of the intentional tort exception.","start":819.042,"stop":841.823,"duration":22.78},{"text":"And so I think for all of these reasons, the Third Circuit was quite wrong to deviate from the plain language of Section 2680(h) in holding that this suit was not barred by the intentional tort exception.","start":841.823,"stop":853.381,"duration":11.56},{"text":"Now, I would like to turn briefly to our Feres argument.","start":853.381,"stop":857.4,"duration":4.02},{"text":"We think that for the reasons I have just stated it is inconceivable that Congress could have intended to allow a plaintiff to circumvent the all-encompassing language of the intentional tort exception by the simple expedient of framing a complaint that sounds negligence by plainly is seeking damages from the United States based on an intentional tort.","start":857.4,"stop":880.848,"duration":23.45},{"text":"Nonetheless, Respondent has done precisely that here, and we think that as a result, her complaint runs squarely up against the Feres doctrine.","start":880.848,"stop":890.49,"duration":9.64},{"text":"Now, under this Court's decision in Feres, a serviceman can't sue the United States under the Tort Claims Act for injuries that arise out of or in the course of his military service.","start":890.49,"stop":903.631,"duration":13.14},{"text":"The Court has explained that the Feres doctrine is based principally on the special relationship between a solider and his superior officers, and it is designed to prevent the adverse effect on military discipline that would occur if soldiers could challenge the decisions of their superior officers in court in the guise of tort claims litigation.","start":903.631,"stop":925.579,"duration":21.95},{"text":"It's really hard to imagine a case that more directly implicates the Feres doctrine than this one, and I invite the Court to take a look at the allegations of Respondent's complaint to see precisely what I mean.","start":925.579,"stop":938.471,"duration":12.89},{"text":"The crucial allegations are at page 14 of the joint appendix, paragraphs 40 and 41 of the complaint.","start":938.471,"stop":947.842,"duration":9.37},{"text":"And the Court will see in paragraphs 40 and 41 that Respondent here alleges that Private Shearer's superior officers at Fort Bliss were negligent in failure to exert more control over Private Heard, a fellow solider at the base, in failing to remove Private Heard from active duty, in failing to prevent Private Heard from injuring his fellow soldiers on the base, and in failing to warn those soldiers of the special danger that Private Heard presented to them.","start":947.842,"stop":981.5,"duration":33.66},{"text":"So what we have here is a tort claims act suit by a soldier that's unabashedly intended to hail his superior officers into court to defend against charges that they were negligent in the way that they controlled or refused to discipline or refused to dismiss from the military some fellow soldier who was at the same base.","start":981.5,"stop":1004.329,"duration":22.83},{"text":"Now, I ask the Court would it... would a suit like this require a civilian court to referee disputes involving military personnel?","start":1004.329,"stop":1014.237,"duration":9.91},{"text":"Would it require a court to intrude
