Scofield there was a transfer of assets for cash and notes, and the Court held that did not satisfy the continuity of interest test, because the only relationship the person transferring the assets to the continuing corporation had was that of a debtor.","start":511.184,"stop":526.609,"duration":15.43},{"text":"Likewise, in Pinellas Ice & Cold Storage Company, there was a transfer of assets for cash and serial bonds which were secured by the assets which were transferred.","start":526.609,"stop":536.965,"duration":10.36},{"text":"This Court there held that there was not a sufficient equity interest in the transferee corporation because there still was only a debtor-creditor relationship.","start":536.965,"stop":546.255,"duration":9.29},{"text":"However, in Minnesota Tea v. Helvering, the receipt of voting trust certificates by this Court was held to satisfy the proprietary interest, and thus, a reorganization was allowed.","start":546.255,"stop":558.414,"duration":12.16},{"text":"In the Minnesota Tea case, the respondent argued that the petitioner in that case had given up common stock and only received back voting certificates, and therefore, there wasn't a good reorganization.","start":558.414,"stop":571.888,"duration":13.47},{"text":"But the Court pointed out that the statute does not require a transferor to receive back the same equity interest that it gave up, as long as it has an equity interest in the continuing operation.","start":571.888,"stop":584.982,"duration":13.09},{"text":"And likewise, on the same day this Court in John A.

continuity of proprietary interest in the corporation which went on that there was a reorganization.","start":584.982,"stop":612.215,"duration":27.23},{"text":"Thus, it is clear from these tests that an equity interest satisfies the continuity of interest test, and it must not be necessarily the same interest, equity interest which was give up as that

court, in holding there was a reorganization, recognized the congressional intent to broadly apply the reorganization sections to encourage combinations of corporations.","start":669.236,"stop":681.443,"duration":12.21},{"text":"Looking at the Senate Finance Committee report accompanying the 1954 Act, it shows that the Senate had rejected a narrow definition of the term 7701 of the Code which provides the general definition.","start":681.443,"stop":702.54,"duration":21.1},{"text":"It also looked back to the original Income Act of 1921 and there found that Congress sought to encourage combinations in reorganizations by allowing shareholders to receive interest in the ongoing corporation which had a readily realizable market value.","start":702.54,"stop":723.722,"duration":21.18},{"text":"But so long as the transferring shareholder kept his money invested in that ongoing corporation and did not withdraw it, there was a valid reorganization.","start":723.722,"stop":734.444,"duration":10.72},{"text":"The position of the respondent in this case is contrary both to the reorganization provisions and certainly to the protection and encouragement of savings and loan associations which Congress has sought to encourage over the years.","start":734.444,"stop":752.14,"duration":17.7},{"text":"By changing his position in 1969, the respondent has discriminated against mutual savings and loan association by not allowing them to be a party to a reorganization where a stock savings and loan association is merged into a mutual savings and loan association.","start":752.14,"stop":771.619,"duration":19.48},{"text":"If reorganizations like this are not allowed, it has a harmful effect on the savings and loan industry, and, for instance, in this case if the reorganization is taxable at the corporate level and at the shareholder level, it takes away those funds which have been invested by the shareholders in a mutual savings and loan association and withdraws them from the market which makes available to homeowners mortgage loans.","start":771.619,"stop":797.604,"duration":25.99},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit below reversed the tax court and found that the interest received by the Paulsens in this case constituted debt rather than a proprietary interest.","start":797.604,"stop":809.328,"duration":11.72},{"text":"In doing so, that Ninth Circuit departed from an unbroken line of cases that had previously examined the issue.","start":809.328,"stop":816.582,"duration":7.25},{"text":"The court of claims in Capital Savings and Loan Association held that such an interest was an equity proprietary interest.","start":816.582,"stop":823.386,"duration":6.8},{"text":"The Sixth Circuit in the West Side Federal also held that such an interest was a proprietary interest.","start":823.386,"stop":828.723,"duration":5.34},{"text":"And in Everett v. the United States, the Tenth Circuit found not only was it proprietary interest, but it constituted voting stock under the more narrow definition as that term is used in the so-called C reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code.","start":828.723,"stop":843.732,"duration":15.01},{"text":"The tax court, of course, in Paulsen had reached the same result, and also in the subsequent case of Owens had found that there was a valid reorganization.","start":843.732,"stop":851.755,"duration":8.02},{"text":"Also, two district courts have held that there had been a reorganization on the same facts... district courts in Wyoming and in the Northern District of Ohio.","start":851.755,"stop":860.594,"duration":8.84},{"text":"Also, the Ninth Circuit in the decision below ignored the cases decided by this Court which had examined the legal characteristics and the rights and obligations of a shareholder in a mutual saving and loan association.","start":860.594,"stop":874.271,"duration":13.68},{"text":"And lastly, the Ninth Circuit misapplied the continuity of proprietary interest test set forth by this test in Minnesota Tea and John A. Nelson when it sought to compare the equity interest which the Paulsens received with the equity interest which they exchanged for their interest in Citizens Federal.","start":874.271,"stop":893.065,"duration":18.79},{"text":"This Court is certainly no stranger to the legal character of share accounts in a mutual savings and loan association.","start":893.065,"stop":900.319,"duration":7.25},{"text":"In 1967 in Tcherepnin v.
