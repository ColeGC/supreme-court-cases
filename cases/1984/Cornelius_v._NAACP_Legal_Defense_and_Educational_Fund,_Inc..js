case.","start":847.235,"stop":850.745,"duration":3.51},{"text":"This brings me to my second point.","start":850.745,"stop":852.648,"duration":1.9},{"text":"It is a non-public forum case in which the

effort.","start":852.648,"stop":868.767,"duration":16.12},{"text":"The third reasonable basis for the President's distinction is avoiding both the reality and also the appearance of using federal resources to advance a particular political cause.","start":868.767,"stop":878.534,"duration":9.77},{"text":"This one is squarely supported by the Court's holding in Lehman versus Shaker Heights,

advertising.","start":878.534,"stop":896.556,"duration":18.02},{"text":"I would like to invite the Court's attention now to one feature that is common to all three of the President's objectives and
