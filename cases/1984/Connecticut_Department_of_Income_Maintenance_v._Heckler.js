Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":34.237,"stop":38.808,"duration":4.57},{"text":"This case presents questions as to the meaning of terms in the Medicaid law, and the State of Connecticut is grateful for the Court for hearing its case today.","start":38.808,"stop":52.449,"duration":13.64},{"text":"The outcome of this case is unusually important because of its bearing on the future care of needy mentally ill in the United States, and because of its impact on the states and their position as partners with the federal government in carrying out the Medicaid program.","start":52.449,"stop":75.481,"duration":23.03},{"text":"Two statutory terms must be construed in this case.","start":75.481,"stop":80.285,"duration":4.8},{"text":"The first is the term IMD.","start":80.285,"stop":89.324,"duration":9.04},{"text":"That is an exception in the statute that limits the coverage that otherwise would be extended for certain medical services.","start":89.324,"stop":98.247,"duration":8.92},{"text":"The second term is ICF.","start":98.247,"stop":105.683,"duration":7.44},{"text":"This is one category of facility that is covered by the Medicaid program, and it is defined in the statute to mean a facility that provides a specified level of service to persons requiring it because of their mental or physical condition.","start":105.683,"stop":126.081,"duration":20.4},{"text":"And the ultimate question presented is the extent to which, if at all, the IMD exception limits Medicaid coverage for ICFs.","start":126.081,"stop":139.407,"duration":13.33},{"text":"The briefs of the parties have treated that question exhaustively, and in so doing have exposed the complexity of the Medicaid laws and the subtlety of many of its standards and distinctions.","start":139.407,"stop":155.366,"duration":15.96}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"May I inquire about the consequences of a ruling adverse to your position?","start":155.366,"stop":164.389,"duration":9.02},{"text":"If the Government is correct in its view of this statute, would it be possible for states to simply scatter mental patients around among the intermediate care facilities and just not put as many of them in a single facility, as existed here, and succeed in having reimbursement by that device?","start":164.389,"stop":191.958,"duration":27.57}]},{"speakerName":"Charles Alvin Miller","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, Justice O'Connor, from the point of view of the mentally ill that would be the principal consequence.","start":191.958,"stop":196.693,"duration":4.74}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Yeah.","start":196.693,"stop":197.243,"duration":0.55},{"text":"And so we're not really talking about the money so much as the inconvenience perhaps of having to scatter them?","start":197.243,"stop":204.283,"duration":7.04}]},{"speakerName":"Charles Alvin Miller","textObjs":[{"text":"I wouldn't call it inconvenience.","start":204.283,"stop":206.283,"duration":2},{"text":"The principal impact is on the care that would be given to mentally ill people.","start":206.283,"stop":211.72,"duration":5.44},{"text":"As the record shows in this case, because Middletown Haven was recognized by everyone involved as being a very fine facility, a facility that specializes in the care of people with mental conditions, it does a much better job for them, even at this intermediate level, than a facility which is treating people for a broad range of conditions, including the many physical conditions associated with those who need some sort of residential care, albeit not the intensive care of hospitals.","start":211.72,"stop":242.474,"duration":30.75},{"text":"So that is a major distinction, and the evidence has shown that in this facility and others like it that specialize in the care of the mentally ill, those people get the kind of care they need and they cannot get elsewhere.","start":242.474,"stop":254.532,"duration":12.06}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"What do you know about the practical application of the Government's test?","start":254.532,"stop":258.784,"duration":4.25},{"text":"Do they look to see whether 50 percent or more of the patients are mental cases, or 30 percent, or how is that being applied in your experience?","start":258.784,"stop":269.791,"duration":11.01}]},{"speakerName":"Charles Alvin Miller","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, we have the experience of the present case and the three companion cases that started out with them at the administrative level.","start":269.791,"stop":277.731,"duration":7.94},{"text":"And there are some other cases that are working their way through the system now.","start":277.731,"stop":282.216,"duration":4.49},{"text":"The answer is that, to begin with, the Government has applied a 50 percent litmus test.","start":282.216,"stop":288.77,"duration":6.55},{"text":"It has a number of other standards as well that it seeks to apply.","start":288.77,"stop":292.491,"duration":3.72},{"text":"All of those standards are designed to find out whether the facility in question is functioning as an alternative to the care of persons in mental hospitals.","start":292.491,"stop":304.649,"duration":12.16},{"text":"And that's one of the points I wanted to make in the argument this morning, that that set of criteria is fundamentally flawed in the sense that it looks to apply a distinction contrary to what the statute applies.","start":304.649,"stop":319.158,"duration":14.51},{"text":"And as I will try to say later, the whole point of the statute here which I am going to refer to, specifically the Long amendment, was designed to encourage the development of alternatives to mental hospitals and to provide funding for the care of people who are placed in these alternatives to the extent the alternative types of facilities are covered by the statute.","start":319.158,"stop":341.155,"duration":22},{"text":"Not all alternatives to mental hospitals are covered by the Medicaid program.","start":341.155,"stop":345.625,"duration":4.47},{"text":"The most common alternative is send someone home and have care in the home or in a community-type facility.","start":345.625,"stop":352.895,"duration":7.27},{"text":"But some alternatives are covered by Medicaid, and nursing homes, either at the skilled level or the intermediate care level, are two that are covered.","start":352.895,"stop":362.418,"duration":9.52},{"text":"And we believe the statute makes fairly evident that that is exactly the way Congress wanted people who are mentally ill to be treated where appropriate.","start":362.418,"stop":371.943,"duration":9.52},{"text":"I said at the outset that the statute was complex, and it is.","start":371.943,"stop":378.43,"duration":6.49},{"text":"It has been described as Byzantine and as an aggravated assault on the English language.","start":378.43,"stop":383.432,"duration":5},{"text":"All that is true.","start":383.432,"stop":384.934,"duration":1.5},{"text":"But those sorts of descriptions ought not be allowed to obscure what is the intended meaning and purpose of the provisions that are under consideration in this case.","start":384.934,"stop":396.391,"duration":11.46},{"text":"And in that connection there are two general propositions that have a central bearing on the case that I would like to make.","start":396.391,"stop":403.828,"duration":7.44},{"text":"The first is that contrary to the position taken by the court below and by the Department of Health and Human Services in its briefs here, Congress has not broadly excluded the mentally ill from the benefits of public assistance under the Social Security Act programs, by which I refer to Medicaid and the financial assistance programs that preceded it in the statute.","start":403.828,"stop":431.581,"duration":27.75},{"text":"It is not true that the mentally ill as a class were left solely to the states for aid in meeting their basic subsistence and health needs.","start":431.581,"stop":443.789,"duration":12.21},{"text":"The mentally ill, if they satisfy the tests for financial eligibility categorical membership, have always qualified for the financial assistance provided by the act.","start":443.789,"stop":455.68,"duration":11.89},{"text":"That includes not only the elderly mentally ill, but also the mentally impaired when the statute was amended in 1950 to provide assistance for those who were disabled.","start":455.68,"stop":468.621,"duration":12.94},{"text":"And when the separate Medical Assistance Program for the Aged was adopted in 1960... that's the immediate precursor to Medicaid... the elderly mentally ill, like others who qualified as needy, were eligible for payment of their services such as doctors, hospital services, and clinic services, and drugs and all the other items listed in the statute, and that carried over into the Medicaid law which was enacted in 1965.","start":468.621,"stop":499.126,"duration":30.5},{"text":"Now, there was an exemption... an exception, I should say, to this eligibility for federally-supported assistance.","start":499.126,"stop":506.38,"duration":7.25},{"text":"Beginning in 1950, a resident in an institution for mental disease, IMD, was not eligible for any of the services that I described.","start":506.38,"stop":517.92,"duration":11.54},{"text":"The scope of that exception is the issue to be decided here.","start":517.92,"stop":522.991,"duration":5.07},{"text":"But this brief review that I have just given of the other forms of assistance that are available under the law, including medical assistance available to the mentally ill, should show that the scope of the IMD exception cannot be decided by an assumption that Congress intended to treat the mentally ill as solely a state responsibility.","start":522.991,"stop":546.79,"duration":23.8},{"text":"The Social Security Act is animated by no such assumption.","start":546.79,"stop":550.991,"duration":4.2},{"text":"And the contrary premise of the court below and of the Department here cannot substitute for an objective analysis of the intended scope of the IMD exception.","start":550.991,"stop":564.501,"duration":13.51},{"text":"And so the absence of a broad policy to exclude the mentally ill from the benefits of the public assistance program leads me to my second general proposition, which is that the IMD exception is a facility specific limitation predicated not only on cost concerns, but also upon a deep hostility to state mental hospitals.","start":564.501,"stop":592.851,"duration":28.35},{"text":"By mid-century these enormous and remote and often demeaning institutions were broadly perceived as the antithesis of how the mentally ill should be treated in this country, and the animus towards these facilities was reflected in the... many ways, including the seminal report of the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health that we've referred to in our brief.","start":592.851,"stop":618.719,"duration":25.87},{"text":"That's the study that was commissioned by the Congress, and which was reported in 1960, and which was followed by the principal legislation that is before the Court today.","start":618.719,"stop":631.561,"duration":12.84},{"text":"So by the time the Medicaid law was enacted in 1965, there was a clear consensus, not only in the Congress but also in the profession and the best thinking around the country that state mental hospitals as they then existed were outmoded, and that successful care of the mentally ill depended upon the development of more suitable facilities and treatment techniques.","start":631.561,"stop":656.594,"duration":25.03},{"text":"And that's the setting in which the IMD provisions of the Medicaid law were adopted.","start":656.594,"stop":664.534,"duration":7.94},{"text":"Now, with those two general propositions as background, let me turn to the specifics of the task at hand today, starting with the words of the statute.","start":664.534,"stop":674.472,"duration":9.94},{"text":"All acknowledge that the IMD exception is not expressly defined in the statute, but the statutory terms do tell us enough to resolve this case, because the IMD exception was part of a group of provisions that have become known as the Long amendment.","start":674.472,"stop":696.655,"duration":22.18},{"text":"That amendment includes the exception to the exception that permits coverage in IMDs, in mental hospitals for the elderly, those over 65 years of age.","start":696.655,"stop":710.446,"duration":13.79},{"text":"That was a change made when Medicaid was adopted in 1965.","start":710.446,"stop":715.882,"duration":5.44},{"text":"But the Long amendment also includes certain conditions that attach to that new coverage, and most specifically, there is the requirement that the states who opt for such coverage adopt comprehensive plans for the care of the mentally ill, and the statute specifically lists nursing homes as one of the alternatives to IMDs that are to be considered and encouraged.","start":715.882,"stop":746.252,"duration":30.37},{"text":"This is, using the U.S. Code designation, it's Section 1396(a)(A)(21).","start":746.252,"stop":755.943,"duration":9.69},{"text":"Any statute with numbers like that is necessarily complex.","start":755.943,"stop":760.761,"duration":4.82},{"text":"And it is... but that statute is strong proof that on its face, the Congress did not intend the term IMD to include nursing homes.","start":760.761,"stop":773.988,"duration":13.23},{"text":"Now, the Department in its briefs points to parenthetical clauses in the listing of covered services in the statute to support its claim that the IMD exception goes beyond mental hospitals and embraces other types of facilities, specifically skilled nursing homes and intermediate care facilities, and it's the latter that's involved in this case.","start":773.988,"stop":801.155,"duration":27.17},{"text":"We've shown in our brief that these parenthetical clauses are to skilled nursing or intermediate care levels of service, and that distinction is very critical.","start":801.155,"stop":813.896,"duration":12.74},{"text":"It refers, those clauses do, to that type of service when offered in a mental hospital setting, as frequently those services are.","start":813.896,"stop":826.288,"duration":12.39}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
