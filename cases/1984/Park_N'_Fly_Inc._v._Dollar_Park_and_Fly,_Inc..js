Missouri.","start":52.18,"stop":62.969,"duration":10.79},{"text":"The business of Park 'N Fly was the so-called offsite airport parking, and that business consists, if Your Honor please, of the

in a defensive posture, that is, when somebody was attempting to cancel a mark.","start":332.094,"stop":364.565,"duration":32.47},{"text":"And so the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held, the gist of their holding was, that the mark Park 'N Fly cannot be cancelled because of the incontestability provision, but cannot be enforced, because the Ninth Circuit found on its own, without the benefit of
