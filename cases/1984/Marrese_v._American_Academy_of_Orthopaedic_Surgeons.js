Solomon, the lessor, when he files his state court proceeding, may realize that he has a breach of lease case, but it is not until discovery and investigation that he may realize that the breach of lease is part of a broader scheme that also gives rise to a federal antitrust claim.","start":306.398,"stop":332.716,"duration":26.32},{"text":"Now, under the Seventh Circuit's decision, arguably the federal claim is then barred because you started the state proceeding.","start":332.716,"stop":343.673,"duration":10.96},{"text":"If it proceeds to judgment, it will then bar the subsequent federal proceeding.","start":343.673,"stop":348.327,"duration":4.65},{"text":"What happens here is that, in the example that I have just illustrated, plus we have found often from our own experience that what

in state court.","start":348.327,"stop":376.995,"duration":28.67},{"text":"Now, normally when there is discovery and additional investigation, and additional facts show there will be another claim, you simply amend your state court suit, but when what you discover is an exclusively federal claim you cannot amend your state court suit.","start":376.995,"stop":395.974,"duration":18.98},{"text":"Now, Justice Flamm's solution to this impasse is to file two suits, a state court suit, the state claim in state court, the federal

simultaneously.","start":409.632,"stop":414.77,"duration":5.14},{"text":"You will have duplicative discovery, duplicative motion practice, and obviously one suit will go to judgment first.","start":414.77,"stop":424.958,"duration":10.19},{"text":"Then, if these do involve the same transaction, the first judgment will undoubtedly have some preclusive effect on the second suit, and that means that any of the proceedings, or at least some of the proceedings in the second suit are redundant.","start":424.958,"stop":443.972,"duration":19.01},{"text":"Now, this certainly is not judicial economy.","start":443.972,"stop":447.074,"duration":3.1},{"text":"Now, finally, or really, the state believes that issue preclusion will take care of most of the concerns that the Seventh Circuit raised.","start":447.074,"stop":460.5,"duration":13.43},{"text":"To take the parade of horribles example in Derish versus San Mateo, if you had a state antitrust statute that was identical to the federal antitrust statute and the state court suit first went to judgment and there was a trial, the second suit will be barred not on claim preclusion but on issue preclusion because a necessary fact for the federal suit will have been determined in the state suit.","start":460.5,"stop":490.853,"duration":30.35},{"text":"Finally, Your Honors, the Seventh Circuit decision is legally unsupportable.","start":490.853,"stop":500.376,"duration":9.52},{"text":"This Court last term in Migra held that a federal court must look to state law to determine the preclusive effect of a state court judgment, and Illinois law is absolutely clear that the first court must have jurisdiction to determine the claim sought to be barred in the second suit.","start":500.376,"stop":526.609,"duration":26.23},{"text":"There are two Illinois decisions that establish that principle, neither one of which is cited in any of the briefs.","start":526.609,"stop":534.982,"duration":8.37},{"text":"These cases are Barton versus Southwick, 258 Illinois 515, and Phelps versus City of Chicago, 331 Illinois

the City of Chicago did not assert the validity of certain tax deeds.","start":551.141,"stop":561.299,"duration":10.16},{"text":"While the suit was pending, a statute was amended which would have

validity of the tax deeds.","start":572.055,"stop":580.161,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The Illinois Supreme Court held that had the first suit gone to judgment before the statute was amended, the first suit would not have been res judicata with respect to the validity of the tax deeds because that claim could not have been raised in the first suit, but since the first suit went to judgment after the statute was amended, the validity of the tax deeds could have been asserted, and therefore the city was estopped, precluded... issue preclusion... from raising that.","start":580.161,"stop":620.238,"duration":40.08},{"text":"Thus Illinois clearly requires that the first court must have jurisdiction over the second claim in order for the second claim to be barred by issue preclusion.","start":620.238,"stop":633.378,"duration":13.14},{"text":"Accordingly, the state would ask this Court to reverse the decision of the Seventh

two successively vacated panel decisions, both dissented to by Justice Stewart, a five-to-four majority of the Seventh Circuit held that the present exclusively federal antitrust action is precluded

1976 and 1977, when those state court actions were filed, no practicing lawyer would have imagined that their outcome might preclude by claim preclusion any subsequent exclusively federal claim, yet

present exclusively federal claim.","start":760.189,"stop":793.679,"duration":33.49},{"text":"At no point during the course of this action has the respondent dared to attempt to defend the merits of the exclusionary actions that it took toward the petitioners.","start":793.679,"stop":806.754,"duration":13.08},{"text":"Instead, it is argued to the District Court that the petitioners do not need to

reasons.","start":853.385,"stop":861.055,"duration":7.67},{"text":"They have further alleged that the respondent's entire nationwide admission system is procedurally arbitrary and unfair, so unfair

petitioners have never received a hearing on these claims, and unless this Court reverses the Seventh Circuit's radical claim preclusion decision, they never will receive such a hearing.","start":881.202,"stop":894.462,"duration":13.26},{"text":"The states of the Seventh Circuit have ably demonstrated the strong policy objections to compelling plaintiffs with both state law and exclusively federal claims to bring their state law claims in federal court.","start":894.462,"stop":909.804,"duration":15.34},{"text":"Indeed, the spectacle of state governments having to

decision.","start":923.314,"stop":935.205,"duration":11.89},{"text":"First, there is an overriding federal rule of the nonpreclusion of exclusively federal claims by claim preclusion as the result of previous judgments when the previous tribunals lacked subject matter jurisdiction over such claims.","start":935.205,"stop":952.398,"duration":17.19},{"text":"Second, as the states of the Seventh

limitation of the claim preclusion doctrine.","start":952.398,"stop":973.747,"duration":21.35},{"text":"Third, even if the Fourth Circuit's adoption of the identity analysis in Nash were correct, so
