Epstein","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is our contention that Mr. Ruefenacht's right to veto every major company decision is joint management of the Continental business in which he repeatedly referred to himself as a partner and the fact that this was an entirely private transaction unique between two individuals which in no sense involved a public capital market, that these collective factors require the conclusion that in substance this was the purchase of a one-half interest in a business, and that the transfer of stock was merely incidental to the transaction.","start":13.389,"stop":52.931,"duration":39.54},{"text":"We submit that the federal securities laws were never meant to cover this kind of a transaction, and that Mr. Ruefenacht's claims of fraud belong in state court.","start":52.931,"stop":62.389,"duration":9.46},{"text":"As authority for our position, Your Honors, we rely fundamentally upon the legislative history of the federal securities laws.","start":62.389,"stop":71.577,"duration":9.19},{"text":"Now, it is true, as was pointed out this morning, that the legislative history does not specifically address the sale of business situation, and indeed both factions in the current judicial debate acknowledge that Congress never specifically considered the sale of business question.","start":71.577,"stop":89.289,"duration":17.71},{"text":"However, the legislative history is replete with an unmistakeable Congressional emphasis upon the goals that the securities laws do seek to achieve.","start":89.289,"stop":100.264,"duration":10.97},{"text":"Those goals, reaffirmed in the legislative history as recently as 1982, and as expressed by this Court in Forman fundamentally were to protect the integrity of public capital markets and to protect investors dealing in those markets.","start":100.264,"stop":115.773,"duration":15.51},{"text":"Now, the legislative history also indicates that these goals emerged from a Congressional recognition that the dispersion of corporate ownership had led to abuses in the capital markets where people who ran corporations were taking advantage of people who owned corporations.","start":115.773,"stop":136.537,"duration":20.76},{"text":"Most importantly, Your Honors, it was recognized by Congress that the effects of such abuses transcend the individual's loss, but rather chill investment and capital formation generally.","start":136.537,"stop":151.212,"duration":14.67},{"text":"It was also recognized by Congress that such abuses could be perpetrated because the owners of corporations did not have managerial control over the operations of those corporations.","start":151.212,"stop":167.122,"duration":15.91},{"text":"The owners held the symbols of ownership but had no ability effectively to influence the destiny of their investment or to influence the operations or the profitability of the corporation.","start":167.122,"stop":179.18,"duration":12.06},{"text":"There is nothing, not one word in the legislative history about protecting someone like Mr. Max Ruefenacht, who engaged in a purely private transaction, unique, as I said, between two individuals which indeed involved stock which could not have been publicly traded because it did not have a common or equivalent value to most people.","start":179.18,"stop":203.395,"duration":24.22}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.

because there is confusion, but on this point of public versus private, I would like to raise and bring to the Court's attention the Superintendent of Insurance case, which has been cited by my opponents all throughout this litigation as standing for the proposition that private transactions are covered by the securities laws.","start":379.875,"stop":401.972,"duration":22.1},{"text":"It is true, as Justice Douglas pointed out there, that that was a private transaction.","start":401.972,"stop":408.31,"duration":6.34},{"text":"However, there was an important public element to that transaction, which was that the securities that were sold in that case were Treasury bonds.","start":408.31,"stop":417.583,"duration":9.27},{"text":"These were securities that were, if not being publicly traded at that time, were certainly of a common or equivalent value to most people, and therefore could have been publicly traded, and therein, I submit to the Court, lies an important public interest in that private transaction.","start":417.583,"stop":435.628,"duration":18.04},{"text":"Now, we submit, Your Honor, that there is nothing in the legislative history indicating a desire to protect someone like Mr. Ruefenacht, who, as I said, engaged in a purely private transaction, idiosyncratic, as between two individuals, which involves no public capital market.","start":435.628,"stop":453.423,"duration":17.8},{"text":"There is nothing in the legislative history indicating a desire to protect Mr. Ruefenacht, who jointly managed this company, and who was no more dependent upon others in this business than one partner is dependent upon another partner to use his or her best efforts and inimitable talents to make a business a success.","start":453.423,"stop":473.837,"duration":20.41},{"text":"Indeed, may I point out to the Court that there was no one in this business who had more control over profitability than Mr. Ruefenacht, and I specifically point to Magistrate Peretti's findings on the fact that Mr. Ruefenacht's veto powers extended not just to questions of capital structure of this company, such as the issuance or transfer of shares, but also to operational decisions going right to the heart of what this company's business was, namely, questions of borrowing money and of the taking on of new product lines.","start":473.837,"stop":508.158,"duration":34.32},{"text":"We submit that this Court in evaluating this transaction under the securities laws cannot ignore Congress's goals simply because there was stock involved in the transaction, but in effect that is just what the Third Circuit did by looking only to the characteristics of the stock and ignoring all of the findings found by the magistrate.","start":508.158,"stop":530.757,"duration":22.6},{"text":"We don't believe that the literal or mechanical approach taken by the Third Circuit was ever intended by Congress in the application of the federal securities laws.","start":530.757,"stop":541.397,"duration":10.64},{"text":"The legislative history urges flexibility in application of the securities laws, but does not say that the Court shall be flexible only where the result will be to extend coverage.","start":541.397,"stop":553.539,"duration":12.14},{"text":"Also, the context clauses, whether they be viewed as relating to the economic context of the transaction, as we believe this Court clearly held in the Weaver case, or as relating to the linguistic context of the statute, as the Third Circuit said, in either of them, I submit to the Court that the context clauses amount to Congressional caveats against literalism and amount to a sufficient basis for the District Court looking into the economic realities of this transaction.","start":553.539,"stop":586.343,"duration":32.8},{"text":"Finally, as we read this Court's decisions from Joiner through Weaver, the Court has never taken a literal or mechanical approach to the securities laws, but rather has repeatedly cautioned against just such an approach.","start":586.343,"stop":601.286,"duration":14.94},{"text":"Now, I submit, Your Honors, that the flaws in the Third Circuit's approach to the securities laws are perhaps put best in focus when one considers application of the securities laws to transactions in notes.","start":601.286,"stop":617.029,"duration":15.74},{"text":"Under a literal approach, all note transactions would be covered including mortgage notes executed in connection with the purchase of a single family residence, and also including notes executed in connection with consumer financing transactions.","start":617.029,"stop":634.157,"duration":17.13},{"text":"But both sides of the current judicial debate, including such eloquent proponents of the literal approach as Judge Friendly and Judge Gibbons below, both sides acknowledge that Congress just could not have meant to cover those kinds of transactions, and as a result both sides, with some variations, employ a case by case analysis in the note context to determine which note transactions implicate federal securities laws concerns.","start":634.157,"stop":668.08,"duration":33.92},{"text":"I submit to the Court that the very same type of case by case analysis is just as essential in the stock area for the very same reasons, namely, to avoid sweeping within the coverage of the federal securities laws a multitude of cases which involve no significant federal concern but which happen to involve stock.","start":668.08,"stop":690.243,"duration":22.16},{"text":"One of the concerns which led the Third Circuit to rule as it did was what can be called the line drawing concern, a concern by Judge Gibbons about distinguishing covered transactions from non-covered transactions.","start":690.243,"stop":705.686,"duration":15.44},{"text":"I submit to the Court that that concern can be greatly ameliorated by the decision in this case.","start":705.686,"stop":713.859,"duration":8.17},{"text":"A narrow holding here that Mr. Ruefenacht's absolute veto powers, joint management, and the fact that this was a unique transaction, that those factors require a conclusion that this was not a federal securities transaction--","start":713.859,"stop":728.702,"duration":14.84}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
