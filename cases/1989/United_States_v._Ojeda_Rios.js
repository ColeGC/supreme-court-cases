sealing violation, regardless of whether it's a short delay where the government's explanation may be very, very reasonable, because what they're asking the Court to do is define satisfactory explanation as no tampering.","start":3175.593,"stop":3195.221,"duration":19.63},{"text":"Once that definition is established, in cases where the test created by the Second Circuit is in fact very,

hearings, and experts coming in.","start":3207.647,"stop":3211.849,"duration":4.2},{"text":"And that, in some ways addresses the question that Justice O'Connor raised, which is this case has gone on for years and years.","start":3211.849,"stop":3218.753,"duration":6.9},{"text":"And does this Court want to create a standard where you are going to compel district courts to have those kind of hearings?","start":3218.753,"stop":3224.24,"duration":5.49},{"text":"The hearings that occurred here that were not satisfying, the district court made no finding on any of the excluded

conclusion, the... the government came first before this Court in its petition for certiorari on page 11 and the government said in that petition, this is a serious problem because despite the best
