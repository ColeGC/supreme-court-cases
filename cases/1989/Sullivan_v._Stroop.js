kind.","start":737.796,"stop":749.438,"duration":11.64},{"text":"Now, the 1988 amendment is helpful not only in terms of the text of the provision, but it is also helpful in terms of the purpose of the provision, because there has been a discussion as to whether the purpose of the provision, of the disregard provision, should be viewed as having the same incentive purpose of obtaining payments from absent parents and trying to get families off of AFDC, or whether it should be viewed as having a purpose, either solely or principally, of mitigating the hardship of the family income requirement and the inclusion of siblings who had previously been excluded.","start":749.438,"stop":786.463,"duration":37.02},{"text":"Now what the amendment does in 1988 is it says that a payment

that, the operation of that, the credit only to timely payments, doesn't make sense if the purpose of the provision is to mitigate the hardship of the family income requirement, because if the sibling
