actions against insurance companies that do not.","start":369.539,"stop":379.067,"duration":9.53},{"text":"They correctly reasoned that direct action was used by Congress as a term of art to refer to a suit against an insurance company on a derivative liability, by which is meant that the cause of action asserted against the insurance company is one which could instead have been asserted against
