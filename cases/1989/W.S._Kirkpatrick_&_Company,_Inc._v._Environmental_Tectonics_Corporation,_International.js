Kirkpatrick Company, entered into an agreement with the Government of Nigeria to supply equipment on an air base, a military air base, in Nigeria.","start":42.018,"stop":58.871,"duration":16.85},{"text":"The equipment was part of... was to be used in an aeromedical center in Nigeria as part of its defense program.","start":58.871,"stop":69.657,"duration":10.79},{"text":"The equipment were things like ejection seats for jet aircraft and centrifugal machines to train pilots.","start":69.657,"stop":78.873,"duration":9.22},{"text":"In connection with obtaining this contract with the Government of Nigeria, our client paid an intermediary, not an official of the Government of Nigeria... our client paid an intermediary an amount of money which, pursuant to an arrangement with the intermediary, was to be used as bribes to officials of the Government of Nigeria.","start":78.873,"stop":109.972,"duration":31.1},{"text":"The amount of money paid was about $1.7 million.","start":109.972,"stop":113.094,"duration":3.12},{"text":"The total contract price was about $10 million.","start":113.094,"stop":116.367,"duration":3.27},{"text":"In 1984, our company was indicted, along with our chief executive officer... actually, it was our predecessor... for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.","start":116.367,"stop":129.827,"duration":13.46},{"text":"We pleaded guilty.","start":129.827,"stop":132.078,"duration":2.25},{"text":"And after that, the plaintiff in this case brought an action against us and is claiming that it is entitled to damages because, but for our bribe, it would have obtained the contract.","start":132.078,"stop":150.339,"duration":18.26},{"text":"It is suing us under the RICO statute, under the Robinson-Patman Act, and it is suing us under a New Jersey RICO statute.","start":150.339,"stop":160.855,"duration":10.52},{"text":"It is not suing under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.","start":160.855,"stop":165.22,"duration":4.37},{"text":"The district court agreed with our position, even after receiving a letter from the legal advisor to the Secretary of State.","start":165.22,"stop":178.507,"duration":13.29},{"text":"That letter was requested by the district court.","start":178.507,"stop":181.52,"duration":3.01},{"text":"And the letter that was received by the district court was kind of inconsistent, internally inconsistent.","start":181.52,"stop":189.854,"duration":8.33},{"text":"One the one hand, it said that the State Department had no objection if this case would go forward.","start":189.854,"stop":198.252,"duration":8.4},{"text":"But, on the other hand, it also said that discovery in this case might seriously affect... that's a quote from the letter... might seriously affect United States foreign relations.","start":198.252,"stop":214.09,"duration":15.84},{"text":"Therefore, the district court said, look, I'm not a member of the State Department, I'm not an expert in foreign relations and this case should be dismissed.","start":214.09,"stop":223.146,"duration":9.06},{"text":"The court of appeals disagreed in the Third Circuit and the court of appeals made a distinction between something which motivates an act of state... namely, in this case we say the act of state is the awarding of the contract itself... and the validity of a contract.","start":223.146,"stop":246.091,"duration":22.95},{"text":"The court of appeals said that we are not claiming... we disagree with this position of the court of appeals... but the court of appeals said that we are not claiming that the act of state here, namely the awarding of the contract, is an invalid act.","start":246.091,"stop":262.892,"duration":16.8},{"text":"We are simply saying that the contract was achieved through bad motives, through a bribe.","start":262.892,"stop":271.749,"duration":8.86},{"text":"That evidence might embarrass the Government of Nigeria but that, the court of appeals says, makes no difference.","start":271.749,"stop":279.426,"duration":7.68},{"text":"It makes this bright line distinction between motivation and validity.","start":279.426,"stop":285.302,"duration":5.88},{"text":"When the court of appeals did that, it went in conflict with the Ninth Circuit in the Clayco case which does not make that distinction.","start":285.302,"stop":296.118,"duration":10.82},{"text":"And that case we say on the facts is the same as this case and, therefore, the two circuits are in conflict.","start":296.118,"stop":305.865,"duration":9.75},{"text":"First, with regard to the motivation validity distinction.","start":305.865,"stop":312.28,"duration":6.41},{"text":"In the first

Nigeria.","start":312.28,"stop":330.883,"duration":18.6},{"text":"And the act of state doctrine says that the courts in the United States shall not examine and pass judgment upon the acts of foreign governments.","start":330.883,"stop":343.732,"duration":12.85},{"text":"Now, the act here... the act of state... is the award of the contract and what the plaintiff is saying is that we obtained this contract through the payment of a bribe; we obtained this contract, they say, in violation of the laws of the Government of Nigeria.","start":343.732,"stop":364.756,"duration":21.02},{"text":"They say that they should have received the contract, not us.","start":364.756,"stop":371.299,"duration":6.54},{"text":"And in doing all of that, it seems to me that the plaintiff would be required to examine the procedures of the award of the contract by the Government of Nigeria, what officials get involved in the award of such a contract, how the award is made.","start":371.299,"stop":393.434,"duration":22.14},{"text":"The complaint in this case doesn't even say that they were the low bidder.","start":393.434,"stop":396.647,"duration":3.21},{"text":"They do say elsewhere in the record, their own statement, that they were the low bidder.","start":396.647,"stop":402.042,"duration":5.39},{"text":"But there is nothing in this record or anyplace else which would even indicate that the low bidder would get the contract.","start":402.042,"stop":408.116,"duration":6.07},{"text":"So, what they would be doing in this case and what we say that the courts in the United States should not be doing, is examining the internal workings of high officials in the Government of Nigeria on matters which directly affect the Government of Nigeria because this is a military contract, a contract that's made in connection with the air force of the Government of Nigeria.","start":408.116,"stop":438.336,"duration":30.22}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
