evidence.","start":848.199,"stop":865.86,"duration":17.66},{"text":"The court has said, and again I believe correctly, that sentencing should not be based on emotional factors which are wholly

in mitigation, and come to a reasoned sentencing decision.","start":876.379,"stop":884.974,"duration":8.6},{"text":"We think this instruction is proper in a case... in a system of sentencing in which the punishment is directly related to the moral culpability or guilt of the defendant.","start":884.974,"stop":895.44,"duration":10.47},{"text":"We think it helped advance the reasoned moral response to the crime to the criminal, which should be the hallmark of capital sentencing, rather than an emotional response to the evidence.","start":895.44,"stop":908.358,"duration":12.92},{"text":"We think

sort of objective sentencing which this Court has sought in capital cases.","start":913.291,"stop":922.418,"duration":9.13},{"text":"One fork in the road would invalidate death penalties which are otherwise complete and acceptable in their consideration of mitigating evidence.","start":922.418,"stop":931.054,"duration":8.64},{"text":"If the jury was not permitted to hear the sympathy plea, that fork in the road increases the discretion of appellate courts to set aside death penalties if they find, as this court of appeals found, that the sentencing jury did not fully consider the evidence
