Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":15.926,"stop":19.545,"duration":3.62},{"text":"The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was created in 1921 by a compact between the states to which Congress consented.","start":19.545,"stop":29.333,"duration":9.79},{"text":"And the principal burden of my argument today before the Court is to demonstrate beyond any question whatsoever that the Port Authority is structured, administered and operated as a direct instrumentality of the compacting states, and is politically and legally accountable as such to the governors and legislatures of the compacting states.","start":29.333,"stop":51.683,"duration":22.35},{"text":"It should therefore, I submit, be recognized for what it clearly is: an integral part of the governmental machinery of the two states, completely subject to their control and direction.","start":51.683,"stop":64.09,"duration":12.41},{"text":"As a direct arm of the states, the Port Authority should be held, I believe, to share the states' constitutional protections and immunities, including their Eleventh Amendment immunity.","start":64.09,"stop":76.314,"duration":12.22},{"text":"Such a holding, I shall show, fulfills not only the underlying purpose of the Eleventh Amendment's conceded deference to state's sovereignty, but also that of the compact clause, by encouraging the states to solve cooperatively their regional problems, thus enhancing, I submit, the vitality of our Federal system.","start":76.314,"stop":96.478,"duration":20.16},{"text":"That the Port Authority is unquestionably a direct arm of the states, fully subject to their control and direction is most easily demonstrated.","start":96.478,"stop":107.019,"duration":10.54},{"text":"The compact declares that the commissioners of the Port Authority, 12 in all, constitute the Port Authority.","start":107.019,"stop":114.689,"duration":7.67},{"text":"Six of these commissioners are appointed by the governor of each state, with the advice and consent of the respective state senates.","start":114.689,"stop":122.962,"duration":8.27},{"text":"The commissioners are subject to removal after charges upon hearing in New York by the governor of the state, and in New Jersey by the state senate.","start":122.962,"stop":133.587,"duration":10.62},{"text":"The governors significantly possess a veto power over all actions which the commissioners of the Authority take.","start":133.587,"stop":141.507,"duration":7.92},{"text":"The Authority cannot take any action which is not subject to gubernatorial veto.","start":141.507,"stop":146.644,"duration":5.14},{"text":"And the Authority, as an arm of the states, is completely subject to legislative control and direction.","start":146.644,"stop":154.75,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The Authority has no autonomous powers of government, like a county or a municipality, which of course, counties and municipalities

the Port Authority is duty bound to be obedient to the legislatures and to follow their directions.","start":175.68,"stop":182.418,"duration":6.74},{"text":"Because of the Port Authority's closeness, intimate relationship to the compacting states, it is not surprising that before 1950 and '51, when the states waived the Port Authority's sovereign immunity, every court that had occasion to pass upon this question, the courts of New York, the courts of New Jersey and the lower Federal courts held that the Port Authority shared the sovereign immunity from suit of the compacting states.","start":182.418,"stop":210.42,"duration":28},{"text":"As a matter of fact--","start":210.42,"stop":211.603,"duration":1.18}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Lesser,

states.","start":257.031,"stop":259.733,"duration":2.7},{"text":"In fact, the only reason probably the Port Authority is not a department of state government was that the necessity of interstate cooperation.","start":259.733,"stop":268.006,"duration":8.27},{"text":"It was the necessity to draft a compact between the states creating this

a matter of fact, the only time the Port Authority was held to exceed its statutory powers was a case in the early 1950s when the Port Authority thought it had the power to construct a third tube to the Lincoln Tunnel, relying upon a statutory directive that said that the Lincoln Tunnel shall consist of tubes or tube... tube or tubes within a narrow geographical compass.","start":316.57,"stop":341.471,"duration":24.9},{"text":"And the Port Authority thought that the plural meant two or more.","start":341.471,"stop":346.541,"duration":5.07},{"text":"But the
