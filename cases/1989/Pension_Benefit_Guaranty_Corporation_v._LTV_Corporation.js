insures the pensions of more than 30 million American workers.","start":14.608,"stop":24.715,"duration":10.11},{"text":"At issue is the scope of the agency's statutory authority to restore a terminated pension plan.","start":24.715,"stop":31.852,"duration":7.14},{"text":"I will discuss how the language of the statute, its legislative history, and PBGC's policy considerations each support its use of that statutory authority in this case.","start":31.852,"stop":44.445,"duration":12.59},{"text":"We begin, of course, with the language of the statute

court of appeals slid right by the statutory language though and went immediately to the legislative history.","start":98.247,"stop":104.817,"duration":6.57},{"text":"And then, rather than examining the legislative history to see whether there was a clearly expressed legislative intent contrary to PBGC's action in this case, the court of appeals turned the analysis on its head.","start":104.817,"stop":117.891,"duration":13.07},{"text":"The court of appeals searched the legislative materials for an explicit reference to the use of restoration that PBGC made here.","start":117.891,"stop":126.164,"duration":8.27},{"text":"Not surprisingly, it found none because the legislative history confirms what the plain language of the statute says, that Congress
