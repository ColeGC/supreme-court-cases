estoppel.","start":283.872,"stop":292.647,"duration":8.77},{"text":"Petitioners cannot correct the denial of the jury trial, according to Respondent, because the district court made not one error but

may make a right, that because the district court proceeded to make findings after his error, Petitioner cannot get review of that.","start":306.997,"stop":319.105,"duration":12.11},{"text":"Now the consequence of this ruling is that a party must seek and be granted interlocutory review of all rulings that might possibly infringe on a right to the jury trial.","start":319.105,"stop":333.276,"duration":14.17},{"text":"Now that is contrary to the Federal system as we know it, and it would be highly disruptive.","start":333.276,"stop":338.56,"duration":5.28},{"text":"It raises the specter of trials being ended before they start, of counsel being required to simply walk out of the court room.","start":338.56,"stop":347.158,"duration":8.6},{"text":"And indeed such a rule would not foster the values of repose that collateral estoppel is designed to foster.","start":347.158,"stop":354.194,"duration":7.04},{"text":"It would, to the contrary, generate additional litigation, generate additional appeals, because it would force counsel to take protective appeals.","start":354.194,"stop":364.551,"duration":10.36},{"text":"Now, Respondents secondly argue that because the court would have directed a verdict for Respondent, a remand in this

case.","start":376.519,"stop":382.353,"duration":5.83},{"text":"The court of appeals did not hold that no reasonable jury would ever hold for Petitioner, or could ever hold for Petitioner.","start":382.353,"stop":390.391,"duration":8.04},{"text":"The court of appeals simply viewed the findings under a sufficiency of the evidence standard.","start":390.391,"stop":396.494,"duration":6.1},{"text":"Second, the record shows that there was considerable evidence on the... on both the issues that Petitioner raised to submit this case to a jury.","start":396.494,"stop":407.54,"duration":11.05},{"text":"And if the district court could have found for either party there can't be a directed verdict.","start":407.54,"stop":413.955,"duration":6.41},{"text":"Now, in our briefs we cite several examples from the record showing why in this record there was sufficient evidence to submit the

Petitioner.","start":422.122,"stop":429.396,"duration":7.27},{"text":"In the instant case the court decided the issues under Rule 41(b).","start":429.396,"stop":435.039,"duration":5.64},{"text":"And under that rule the judge could indeed do what he did.","start":435.039,"stop":438.012,"duration":2.97},{"text":"The judge could make rulings on disputed
