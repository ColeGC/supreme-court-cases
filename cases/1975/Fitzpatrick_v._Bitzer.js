the law in a fashion discriminatory against men.","start":470.244,"stop":510.502,"duration":40.26},{"text":"The problem of course and the reason why we are here is in the process, the Court relying on the Eleventh Amendment in Edelman and Jordan denied a recalculation of retroactive retirement benefits which I am for shorthand referring to as back pay and also denied attorney’s fees and in that of course, we submit there is error in the Second Circuit said that the District Court was wrong as to attorney’s fees only and I will be addressing most of my argument to the back pay

sector.","start":568.476,"stop":577.765,"duration":9.29},{"text":"There seems to be no question in language plus the intent of Congress that Congress intended to make a state employer subject to the same obligations as private employers and give state employees access to all the remedies under Title VII that an employee of private industry would have.","start":577.765,"stop":602.171,"duration":24.41},{"text":"Now, the effective nullification by the decision of the Court below of the monetary remedial provisions of Title VII in the state context to me cannot be squared with two recent decisions of this Court.","start":602.171,"stop":621.623,"duration":19.45},{"text":"Foremost is the Albemarle versus Moody case about a year ago and then less than a month ago the case of Franks versus Bowman.","start":621.623,"stop":632.035,"duration":10.41},{"text":"These cases demonstrate in various forms, two forms primarily, first back pay

remedy.","start":632.035,"stop":666.47,"duration":34.44},{"text":"There is no cut off point in the remedial section of Title VII between monetary damages or cause of action from monetary damages on the one hand and an injunction which was obtained here on the other.","start":666.47,"stop":692.702,"duration":26.23},{"text":"As a matter of fact, the Albemarle case indicated that it would be inappropriate to open up any chasm between the injunctive and the monetary aspects.","start":692.702,"stop":708.381,"duration":15.68},{"text":"Now, having said that in the private context and Congress having found that discrimination in governmental employment was perhaps more institutionalized, worse than in private employment.","start":708.381,"stop":729.293,"duration":20.91},{"text":"It seems that if the range of the equitable remedies available against states are cut down, that private suits to enforce state employees rights are likely to disappear.","start":729.293,"stop":749.136,"duration":19.84},{"text":"It is certainly apparent and it was Congress’ intent that private suits would be a prime means of enforcing the law and that the resources of the Attorney General were insufficient to take care of all these cases.","start":749.136,"stop":766.562,"duration":17.43},{"text":"Furthermore, it was apparent that Congress was relying as has had to be the case in the civil rights area for a Century, on the federal courts and it gave the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction and yet the Court below suggested that Congress could and both of this areas have done things differently.","start":766.562,"stop":790.632,"duration":24.07},{"text":"In other words, that reliance could have been had on the Attorney General alone or that state courts might be available.","start":790.632,"stop":800.89,"duration":10.26},{"text":"In stressing, as both Albemarle and the Franks cases have the equitable remedy, a remedy that is not like damages, not subject to jury trial, that is part of a complex to try to solve on a case by case basis as the lower court, the trial court seems fit.","start":800.89,"stop":829.458,"duration":28.57},{"text":"The Congress has in effect solved a problem of federalism and I would suggest to the Court that in doing so, a couple of things have been accomplished, they are quite vital.","start":829.458,"stop":849.488,"duration":20.03},{"text":"First of all, it is perhaps most appropriate that in this very difficult area of federalism, federal concern that Congress made up of the representatives of the various states is the most appropriate forum to determine what remedy rights and remedies there should be and of course here, Congress has spoken very clearly and in speaking very clearly and in giving the District Courts these full equitable powers not only to issue the injunction, but to order other affirmative relief etc.","start":849.488,"stop":898.167,"duration":48.68},{"text":"as the recent decisions have pointed out, the Congress I submit has allowed the lower court to take into account one factor that might be inappropriate concern in the difficult federal equation in modern times and that is this.","start":898.167,"stop":919.63,"duration":21.46},{"text":"That if in a particular case, the impact on the Federal Treasury is too severe, it is perhaps something that could be taken into account by the Court to allow payment over a period of time, not award full back pay, do something other than might be done in the private sector and just what would be done --","start":919.63,"stop":950.917,"duration":31.29}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

have in view of the complaint filed by the plaintiff’s, the petitioners here, it would have promptly re-evaluated this aspect of its employment practices and done something about it or at least in

pattern and in doing that, I think there was a recognition that this sort of problem is a problem that Congress can most appropriately decide and then Congress took the next step and said well of course we can only decide on a broad basis, we will have to leave it as it has always been the case in discrimination situation for the lower court, the trial court in the particular situation to fashion the appropriate relief which is of course an injunction and other relief.","start":1337.96,"stop":1392.089,"duration":54.13},{"text":"Well now that relief just does not appear by magic on the

enough state employees make enough noise and band together, maybe they will interest the Attorney General, but if they do not, a lot a valid claims are going to go wanting and the state employer is

had said recently in Albemarle and the case like Franks and Bowman.","start":1465.172,"stop":1510.232,"duration":45.06},{"text":"Furthermore, in Edelman there was a distinction drawn which I hope will
