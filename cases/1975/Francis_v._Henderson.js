this case on the day before trial, June 23 was a motion for continuance on a form borrowed from the District Attorney’s office which was struck through by Mr. Turow to accommodate it for Francis’ use.","start":295.807,"stop":314.786,"duration":18.98},{"text":"That motion for continuance filed as I said just the day before trial, the very first motion filed in this capital case saw the

which is a form of discovery under Louisiana Law, another motion for Bill of Particulars.","start":331.363,"stop":337.288,"duration":5.93},{"text":"The third was a motion challenging the grand jury indictment only on vagueness grounds and of course it did not involve the exclusion of black question.","start":337.288,"stop":346.015,"duration":8.73},{"text":"Now, our position is that the fact that those motions were filed the day before trial is just one more factor to be considered.","start":346.015,"stop":353.508,"duration":7.49},{"text":"The form of those motions, on a form borrowed from the District Attorney, at least the motion for continuance was borrowed from District Attorney, is one more factor to be considered.","start":353.508,"stop":362.963,"duration":9.46},{"text":"On the day of trial, a fourth motion was filed.","start":362.963,"stop":365.837,"duration":2.87},{"text":"That motion was one to suppress the statements which Francis had allegedly given.","start":365.837,"stop":370.181,"duration":4.34},{"text":"The motion to suppress was filed.","start":370.181,"stop":371.526,"duration":1.35},{"text":"It was denied without a hearing and the record of this case reflects that no exception was taken to that denial without a hearing, although an exception was required under Louisiana Law and so one more example of the factors which we say taken in their totality begin to speak of ineffective assistance of counsel.","start":371.526,"stop":389.484,"duration":17.96},{"text":"Francis was tried on June 24, 1965.","start":389.484,"stop":392.651,"duration":3.17},{"text":"He was convicted on that day and five days later, he was sentenced.","start":392.651,"stop":397.416,"duration":4.76},{"text":"He was sentence to life imprisonment.","start":397.416,"stop":399.647,"duration":2.23},{"text":"There was no appeal taken from that conviction.","start":399.647,"stop":402.193,"duration":2.55},{"text":"The record is clear that Francis knew of his right to an appeal, wanted an appeal and yet no appeal was taken and one of the reasons that Mr. Amadi gave for not taking the appeal was that he and Mr. Turow did not want to make this case a life’s work.","start":402.193,"stop":416.82,"duration":14.63},{"text":"They felt that the jury by sparing the life of Francis had done enough, and therefore, no appeal was taken.","start":416.82,"stop":424.907,"duration":8.09},{"text":"Now, what we are saying is all of those facts together begin to -- more than begin, all of those facts together show that Francis’ counsel was ineffective and did not offer him the kind of protection which ought to have been offered.","start":424.907,"stop":439.368,"duration":14.46},{"text":"So any presumption of the effectiveness was overcome by these facts.","start":439.368,"stop":445.658,"duration":6.29},{"text":"Francis later applied to the Louisiana Trial Court for habeas corpus, claiming that he was denied his right to appeal and also claiming that blacks have been excluded from the grand jury which indicted him.","start":445.658,"stop":458.7,"duration":13.04},{"text":"The application was denied.","start":458.7,"stop":460.272,"duration":1.57},{"text":"It was denied essentially because Francis had not made a timely challenge and under the applicable Louisiana Statute, if one did not make a timely challenge to the grand jury, then the right to challenge a grand jury was absolutely barred and because of that absolute forfeiture rule, Francis had no opportunity to raise this issue in state habeas corpus proceedings and to fully develop of whether or not there was any cause or whether or not he waived the right to challenge the grand jury.","start":460.272,"stop":490.131,"duration":29.86},{"text":"He then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus after the Louisiana Supreme Court that denied certiorari on the case.","start":490.131,"stop":496.612,"duration":6.48},{"text":"The District Court for this in the District of Louisiana granted Francis' petition for writ of habeas corpus, finding that Francis did not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to be indicted by a fairly constituted grand jury, Finding any alternative that if the test with that of Davis cause shown then Francis had met that test by virtue of the inexperience of his counsel in this proceeding.","start":496.612,"stop":524.105,"duration":27.49},{"text":"The Court also found the grand jury which indicted Francis did indeed exclude blacks and they vacated the indictment, set aside the conviction and ordered the state to re-indict and retry Francis if it so desired.","start":524.105,"stop":535.416,"duration":11.31},{"text":"The state appealed to the Fifth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit held that the Davis test is the applicable test, not the Fay versus Noia test.","start":535.416,"stop":543.07,"duration":7.65},{"text":"But it held that the Davis test in this case because of the absolute forfeiture rule in Louisiana, would require Francis to show prejudice, not cause which is what Davis speaks of, but prejudice.","start":543.07,"stop":554.936,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Now, the Fifth Circuit has taken two positions.","start":554.936,"stop":557.874,"duration":2.94},{"text":"When there have been state rules which parallel Rule 12 (b) (2), the Fifth Circuit has said that a state defendant must show cause.","start":557.874,"stop":566.052,"duration":8.18},{"text":"But in Louisiana because the rule is one of absolute forfeiture, the Fifth Circuit said that Francis must show more than cause.","start":566.052,"stop":573.881,"duration":7.83},{"text":"He must show actual prejudice.","start":573.881,"stop":576.822,"duration":2.94},{"text":"Our position is first, that Davis does not apply.","start":576.822,"stop":580.466,"duration":3.64},{"text":"Davis does not applied because it turns upon the fact that Congress by adapting Rule 12 (b) (2) of the Federal Rules of criminal procedure set a new standard for determining waiver and that standard is one of cause.","start":580.466,"stop":594.143,"duration":13.68},{"text":"So, Congress' action vis-a-vis 2255 is what Davis turns upon.","start":594.143,"stop":600.081,"duration":5.94},{"text":"There is no analogous provision regarding 2254.","start":600.081,"stop":604.364,"duration":4.28},{"text":"Congress has not in any way limited access under 2254, except by the exhaustion of state remedies requirement which is written into the statute.","start":604.364,"stop":613.571,"duration":9.21},{"text":"So we say Davis does not apply, but if the Court would find that Davis does apply then we believe Francis has met the test of Davis.","start":613.571,"stop":622.653,"duration":9.08},{"text":"That test is one of cause because the rule speaks of cause.","start":622.653,"stop":626.951,"duration":4.3},{"text":"Davis speaks of cause and one of the touchstones of cause is ineffective assistance of counsel and Francis’ counsel was ineffective, especially as to protecting this very basic constitutional right which he was entitled to.","start":626.951,"stop":641.184,"duration":14.23},{"text":"The state has argued that the Davis test should apply because the interest of the state and the Federal government are the same.","start":641.184,"stop":650.451,"duration":9.27},{"text":"If the interest of the state and the
