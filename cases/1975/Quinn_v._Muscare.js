at a uniform inspection, the superior officers declined to inspect him.","start":129.603,"stop":134.671,"duration":5.07},{"text":"He then brought himself in to compliance by shaving.","start":134.671,"stop":137.689,"duration":3.02},{"text":"The following year, Mr. Muscare again grew a beard.","start":137.689,"stop":141.074,"duration":3.39},{"text":"This time he was

Muscare appeared with his squad at Chicago Fire Department Academy for instruction in a two-day course in the use of self-contained breathing apparatus which were safety masks, he was again wearing a

mask.","start":175.972,"stop":187.254,"duration":11.28},{"text":"Muscare disputed this and contented that New York and Boston permitted Firefighters to wear long hair and beards.","start":187.254,"stop":194.638,"duration":7.38},{"text":"Each member of the class was expected to put the apparatus on, charge it and test it to determine whether or not he was getting a good facial fit.","start":194.638,"stop":202.718,"duration":8.08},{"text":"Johnson stated that by watching a firefighter try on the mask, he could tell whether he succeeded in attaining a tight facial

not.","start":225.631,"stop":237.77,"duration":12.14},{"text":"Instructor Johnson stated at the trial that he did not know whether Muscare while wearing his beard could get a good seal on the mask because Muscare did not put the mask on and a gas mask can be tested only by a man putting it on.","start":237.77,"stop":250.87,"duration":13.1},{"text":"In due course, Instructor Johnson reported Muscare’s conduct in the class to the Drill Master.","start":250.87,"stop":256.461,"duration":5.59},{"text":"Muscare was soon in the same month, December 1973, warned that he would not be permitted to

was taken ill with appendicitis, no further action was taken for more than two months.","start":272.744,"stop":282.446,"duration":9.7},{"text":"Then a suspension of 29 days was issued on February of 1974 to Muscare and he was notified in person by three superior officers who came to his Fire Station and informed him that he was suspended, effective immediately.","start":282.446,"stop":298.291,"duration":15.84},{"text":"A letter subsequently followed on March 4, 1974 from the Chief of Personnel, Chief Brown, indicated that he was charged of violation of three rules.","start":298.291,"stop":307.666,"duration":9.38},{"text":"The first rule was the failure to conform to the grooming code.","start":307.666,"stop":311.427,"duration":3.76},{"text":"The second rule was his violation of conduct unbecoming a Firefighter and the third violation was his disobedience of a direct and lawful order.","start":311.427,"stop":320.396,"duration":8.97},{"text":"Muscare did not ask, exercised his statutory right provided for under the Illinois statute, Chapter 24, Section 18-1 to a hearing before the Civil Service Commission.","start":320.396,"stop":332.833,"duration":12.44},{"text":"The Civil Service Commission is empowered, and in the event it finds the suspension unwarranted,

adverse determination of the commission, the employee has a statutory right to judicial review with the right of further appeal to the higher court.","start":343.134,"stop":351.503,"duration":8.37},{"text":"Muscare failed to exhaust these remedies.","start":351.503,"stop":354.429,"duration":2.93},{"text":"Instead of exhausting his administrative remedies before the Civil Service Commission, Muscare filed the instant lawsuit under 43 U.S.C. 1983 on March 11.","start":354.429,"stop":368.403,"duration":13.97},{"text":"The basic thrust of the complaint dealt with -- asked for declaratory injunctive relief on the grounds that the Grooming Code of the Fire Department infringed upon his constitutional rights and the other two violations that he had been charged with, were both vague, and therefore, overly broad and unconstitutional.","start":368.403,"stop":386.889,"duration":18.49},{"text":"He also indicated that he did receive Due Process of law in the imposition of this penalty.","start":386.889,"stop":392.52,"duration":5.63},{"text":"The District Court denied both a temporary and permanent injunction, upheld the validity of the no-beard rule, indicating that Muscare had been afforded Due Process and entered a judgment in favor of the department.","start":392.52,"stop":403.733,"duration":11.21},{"text":"Primarily the Court did not look to any of the other two reasons that had been alleged for the basis of this grooming code, one of
