Kilcullen","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, these consolidated cases present a single legal issue as to whether the Bureau of Mines of the Department of Interior in assessing civil penalties for alleged violations of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act followed strictly the procedural requirements spelled out by Congress in the Act.","start":25.187,"stop":55.643,"duration":30.46},{"text":"The Act directs that the operator of a coal mine in which a violation occurs shall be assessed to civil penalty by the Secretary of the Interior in an amount not less than $10,000 for each violation.","start":55.643,"stop":70.527,"duration":14.88},{"text":"The penalty provisions of the statute are mandatory, i.e., the Secretary must assess penalty in each instance where he finds a violation.","start":70.527,"stop":82.053,"duration":11.53},{"text":"In this respect, the Act differs from other occupational safety Acts such as OSHA which give the administrative agency discretion to assess penalties where a fault is found.","start":82.053,"stop":96.198,"duration":14.14},{"text":"Here, the statute requires in each case that a penalty be assessed regardless of fault.","start":96.198,"stop":103.531,"duration":7.33},{"text":"Because of the mandatory nature of the penalty provisions of this statute, Congress wrote into the Act certain procedural safeguards which must be followed by the Secretary in assessing these penalties.","start":103.531,"stop":120.151,"duration":16.62},{"text":"The Act expressly provides that a penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary only after a mine operator charged with the violation has had an opportunity for a public hearing and the Secretary has determined by decision incorporating findings of fact that a violation occurred and the amount of the penalty which is warranted.","start":120.151,"stop":142.482,"duration":22.33},{"text":"The statute also requires that hearings be subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.","start":142.482,"stop":149.936,"duration":7.45},{"text":"In determining the amount of the penalty, the Secretary must consider six criteria spelled out in the statute: the operator’s prior record of violations, the size of his business, whether he was negligent, the gravity of the violation, his good faith effort to achieve compliance, and whether the penalty would affect his ability to continue in business.","start":149.936,"stop":174.903,"duration":24.97},{"text":"These cases are before the Court because the Secretary has not applied these procedural safeguards.","start":174.903,"stop":182.264,"duration":7.36},{"text":"Instead, he has adapted a summary type of procedure under which he has authorized the Bureau of Mines to issue a proposed order, a proposed assessment, in advance of any hearing or any finding or determination that a violation occurred.","start":182.264,"stop":201.84,"duration":19.58},{"text":"Unless the mine operator request formal adjudication within a certain number of days after he receives such a proposed order, the order becomes final by its terms.","start":201.84,"stop":214.311,"duration":12.47},{"text":"The Bureau of Mines’ Assessment Officer who issues these assessment orders is not a qualified administrative law judge nor does he have authority to hold hearings or adjudicate disputed issues.","start":214.311,"stop":232.427,"duration":18.12},{"text":"On deposition, he admitted that he made no effort to determine whether a violation had in fact occurred, and he also admitted that in fixing the amount of the penalty he had simply followed a preset penalty schedule which gave no consideration to the six statutory criteria.","start":232.427,"stop":253.56,"duration":21.13},{"text":"In the National Independent Coal Operators’ case, the District Court found that the Assessment Officer gave no meaningful consideration to the six statutory criteria for determining penalties and that he made no independent determination as to whether the charged violation had occurred.","start":253.56,"stop":270.62,"duration":17.06},{"text":"In the Delta Mining Group of cases, the District Courts refused enforcement of these penalty assessment orders on the same ground, that they were not based on a genuine determination as to the occurrence of a violation or consideration of the statutory criteria for determining the penalty amount.","start":270.62,"stop":292.741,"duration":22.12},{"text":"Now, the Government has argued that the statutory language requires only that the mine operator be given an opportunity for a hearing, and if he does not request a hearing there is no need for a decision incorporating findings of fact.","start":292.741,"stop":309.869,"duration":17.13},{"text":"In other words, the procedural requirements of the Act are satisfied simply by advising the operator that he can request a hearing.","start":309.869,"stop":318.314,"duration":8.44},{"text":"The balance of the Section which calls for determination, the Government says, becomes inoperative once he had been given this opportunity for a hearing.","start":318.314,"stop":328.674,"duration":10.36},{"text":"The District Courts in the cases below rejected this argument and held that in all cases, before an assessment order can become final, it must be supported by a decision incorporating the Secretary’s findings of fact that a violation did occur in the amount of the penalty which is warranted, and held that the procedures leading to the orders sought to be enforced by the Secretary did not comply with the requirements of the Act.","start":328.674,"stop":359.075,"duration":30.4}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
