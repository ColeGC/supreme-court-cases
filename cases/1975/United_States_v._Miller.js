claimant's own person, houses, papers, or effects.","start":607.33,"stop":638.266,"duration":30.94},{"text":"In fact, the rule has been precisely the contrary that the Fourth Amendment does not

start with Goldstein against the United States and go on through Jones, Wong Sun and Alderman, all of which are quite specific on this point and the Court has also applied this doctrine with specific

papers.","start":672.58,"stop":710.421,"duration":37.84},{"text":"It was done in both Donaldson against the United States, involving a former employer's records, concerning Donaldson and then later in California Bankers against Shultz, where the Court pointed out that as long ago as 1925, it had decided that an internal revenue summons directed to a third party bank was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of either the bank or the person under investigation by the taxing authorities and then quoted with approval, Mr. Justice Douglas’ statement concurring in Donaldson that it is difficult to see how the summoning of a third party and the records of a third party can violate the rights of the tax payer, even if a criminal prosecution is contemplated or in progress, which seems to us to be directly on point here.","start":710.421,"stop":778.53,"duration":68.11},{"text":"As the Court also pointed out in Couch against the United States, the landmark precedent concerning the
