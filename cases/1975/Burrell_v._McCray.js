we call creeping stare decisis.","start":806.266,"stop":833.101,"duration":26.84},{"text":"The Miller decision, however, finally returned the case law in this area to its proper and established path.","start":833.101,"stop":840.485,"duration":7.38},{"text":"As this Court was sure enough of its questionable role as a super sensor and as the Lower Courts were sure enough of their roles as
