the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.","start":42.922,"stop":50.239,"duration":7.32},{"text":"It involves the interpretation of 31 U.S.C. 191 which provides that when a person indebted to the United States becomes insolvent, the debts due to the United States shall be paid first.","start":50.239,"stop":63.811,"duration":13.57},{"text":"The issue here is whether that priority of the United States, applies only when the precise amount of the debt is established before insolvency or whether all debts due to the United States since insolvency, whether liquidated or not, are to be paid first.","start":63.811,"stop":81.337,"duration":17.53},{"text":"The fact here were stipulated.","start":81.337,"stop":83.563,"duration":2.23},{"text":"Emsco which is a Texas Corporation breached three contracts with the Defense Department.","start":83.563,"stop":89.589,"duration":6.03},{"text":"After they had breached the contracts, it assigned all its property to respondent to be sold for the benefit of its creditors and that act of course established its insolvency.","start":89.589,"stop":101.79,"duration":12.2},{"text":"Shortly thereafter, the Government re-let those contracts that Emsco had breached and the amount of Emsco’s debt to the Government was determined.","start":101.79,"stop":111.137,"duration":9.35},{"text":"It was determined by settlement of two of the contracts and by charging Emsco for the excess costs of re-procurement on the other.","start":111.137,"stop":121.502,"duration":10.36},{"text":"The priority statute requires that when a person indebted to the Government becomes insolvent, the debts to the United States shall be paid first.","start":121.502,"stop":130.176,"duration":8.67},{"text":"And a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors is the one of the ways in which insolvency can be shown under the statute.","start":130.176,"stop":138.256,"duration":8.08},{"text":"It is -- that is also an act of bankruptcy.","start":138.256,"stop":141.563,"duration":3.31},{"text":"So that when there is an assignment for the benefit of creditors, the creditors have a choice.","start":141.563,"stop":148.209,"duration":6.65},{"text":"They can either consent to the assignment and take their share of the debtor's estate under the conditions in the assignment or if they prefer the protection of Bankruptcy Laws, they can petition to have the debtor declared a bankrupt, in which case the assignment is void.","start":148.209,"stop":168.474,"duration":20.26},{"text":"If there had been a petition in bankruptcy here, it is clear that the Government's claims on this contract would have been debts provable in bankruptcy because the Bankruptcy Act expressly defines debts to include un-liquidated or even contingent claims.","start":168.474,"stop":186.239,"duration":17.77},{"text":"These are provable debts and so long as they are liquidated or can be estimated soon enough, so that they can paid without unduly delaying the Administration of the estate, they are allowable.","start":186.239,"stop":208.479,"duration":22.24},{"text":"In addition, the bankruptcy Act gives a priority to debts owing to any person, including the United States entitled to a priority under Federal Law, so that the Bankruptcy Act incorporates the priority statute by reference.","start":208.479,"stop":226.025,"duration":17.55},{"text":"A number of cases, both in this Court and in the Courts of Appeals have assumed that this priority applies to claims like the ones here which were un-liquidated when insolvency occurred.","start":226.025,"stop":240.94,"duration":14.91},{"text":"So that if there had been a bankruptcy, we submit that these claims would not only have been provable, but would been entitled to a priority.","start":240.94,"stop":250.509,"duration":9.57},{"text":"But there was not any petition in bankruptcy here.","start":250.509,"stop":253.511,"duration":3},{"text":"The Government simply asserted its claims to priority under the priority statute.","start":253.511,"stop":258.18,"duration":4.67},{"text":"When the claim was denied, the Government brought suit in the District Court following the established principle, found that the Government was indeed entitled to its priority, but the Court of Appeals reversed.","start":258.18,"stop":273.826,"duration":15.65},{"text":"It interpreted, it is a 175 year old statute without considering any of the previous cases which it had construed, the policy it was designed to serve or even the long-standing practice under it.","start":273.826,"stop":288.306,"duration":14.48},{"text":"The Court held that before its debts due means only those debts which would have been entitled to be recovered under Common Law Action of Debt.","start":288.306,"stop":301.64,"duration":13.33},{"text":"Since the claims here were not for fixed and certain amounts presently payable at insolvency, they were not debts due at Common Law, and therefore, the Court held they were not entitled to priority.","start":301.64,"stop":316.484,"duration":14.84},{"text":"We submit that that decision is simply wrong, both on the basis of precedent and because it was undesirable, practical effects.","start":316.484,"stop":326.137,"duration":9.65},{"text":"The precedents are entirely clear in holding that the priority statute applies not only to debts which are due in the sense of being presently payable, when at the moment that insolvency occurs, but it also applies to debts where the obligation has accrued, but the time for payment has not yet arrived.","start":326.137,"stop":350.484,"duration":24.35},{"text":"In fact the respondent does not really dispute this, but we submit that that fact alone should demonstrate the Common Law Action for Debt which requires that the debt be presently payable is not an appropriate standard for defining debts due.","start":350.484,"stop":367.579,"duration":17.1},{"text":"Indeed if the standard were strictly applied, there could be some question about whether taxes would be within the priority at all.","start":367.579,"stop":375.417,"duration":7.84},{"text":"Since there are some precedent indicating that taxes are not Common Law debts.","start":375.417,"stop":380.812,"duration":5.4},{"text":"And of course the status of taxes which have accrued, but which are not payable at the precise point of the insolvency would still more uncertain.","start":380.812,"stop":394.64,"duration":13.83},{"text":"There is not any such uncertainty now.","start":394.64,"stop":397.165,"duration":2.53},{"text":"Priority statute clearly applies to all accrued taxes, including un-liquidated ones and to those which have accrued but are not yet due, when the insolvency occurs.","start":397.165,"stop":410.008,"duration":12.84},{"text":"The priority statute also has long been assumed to apply to contract debts of the sort involved here where the obligation has been established by the time that the insolvency occurs, but the precise amount of the obligation is not settled until later.","start":410.008,"stop":427.982,"duration":17.97},{"text":"The effect on Government Revenues of altering this long-standing interpretation of the priority statute is hard to estimate.","start":427.982,"stop":436.427,"duration":8.44},{"text":"Indeed for the tax applications, we really have not been able to get any estimate because the effect of the decision is so unclear.","start":436.427,"stop":444.852,"duration":8.42},{"text":"What it does is create questions, but there is really no way of telling what the precise impact of it would be.","start":444.852,"stop":453.02,"duration":8.17},{"text":"On the contract applications, the Defense Department has estimated that in a typical year, perhaps some $20 million in Government claims in Defense contracts alone might be affected.","start":453.02,"stop":466.049,"duration":13.03},{"text":"There is a further reason why the decision below should be reversed, in addition to its precedent and its effect on Government revenues.","start":466.049,"stop":474.427,"duration":8.38},{"text":"It provides a practically unworkable standard for the person who must distribute the insolvent's estate.","start":474.427,"stop":481.282,"duration":6.85},{"text":"He must decide whether a given Government claim is entitled to priority and if he guesses wrong, he may be personally liable to the Government for the amount paid to the other creditors.","start":481.282,"stop":495.705,"duration":14.42},{"text":"It is therefore very important to have clear standards for determining when the priority applies and the limitations of the Common Law Action for Debt are certainly not the kind of clear standards that are appropriate.","start":495.705,"stop":512.056,"duration":16.35},{"text":"The respondent seems to agree that the decision below cannot really mean exactly what it says.","start":512.056,"stop":517.994,"duration":5.94},{"text":"He suggests that nevertheless, this Court should limit the debts to which the priority statute applies to ones which have been liquidated before the insolvency occurs.","start":517.994,"stop":529.479,"duration":11.49},{"text":"But that limitation too is unsupported by precedent and it is also unrelated to the purpose of the priority statute.","start":529.479,"stop":538.167,"duration":8.69},{"text":"The Courts have consistently interpreted the statute as applying to all types of debts.","start":538.167,"stop":543.82,"duration":5.65},{"text":"They have recognized that its broad purpose is to protect the Federal Revenues and when a particular debt is liquidated, is not significant in terms of that policy.","start":543.82,"stop":556.984,"duration":13.16},{"text":"The Government's interest in assuring that the debts owed to it will be paid is not related to the time of the precise amount of the debt is determined.","start":556.984,"stop":568.242,"duration":11.26},{"text":"But there is an appropriate source of guidance for determining the meaning of the debts in the priority statute.","start":568.242,"stop":574.521,"duration":6.28},{"text":"That source is the Bankruptcy Act, which uses the precise term and as used in the Bankruptcy Act, the term “debts” explicitly includes un-liquidated and contingent claims.","start":574.521,"stop":588.589,"duration":14.07}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Of course the Bankruptcy Act came along a
