close-shop which requires union membership at the time of hire was to be barred that no employee who is not a union member at the time of hire could be required to join the union for the first 30 days or pay dues, that thereafter there was nothing in Federal Law which prohibited as a condition of continued employment the requirement that employees pay dues, but that the states were free to enact their own policy on the question of whether after the 30th day of employment, employees could be required to pay dues or become union members as a condition of continued employment.","start":501.796,"stop":559.003,"duration":57.21},{"text":"We think that that background is relevant because it indicates a Congressional determination to be neutral between right to work

the meaning of the employment relationship?","start":572.606,"stop":615.663,"duration":43.06},{"text":"Where is the center of the employment
