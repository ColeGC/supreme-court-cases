implausibility that respondent could have -- had he attacked her first succeeded in inflicting such grievous wounds upon him and escaping totally unscathed herself.","start":793.15,"stop":813.462,"duration":20.31},{"text":"Now, if a new trial is going to be required on the basis of evidence such as this, we think there is a very little left to any principal of finality of judgments in criminal cases.","start":813.462,"stop":824.274,"duration":10.81},{"text":"Turning to the analytical framework; in our view cases like this can and should be approached analytically in much the same manner as any motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.","start":824.274,"stop":836.958,"duration":12.68},{"text":"The first ingredient in every such case is the question whether the evidence is in fact properly characterized as newly discovered.","start":836.958,"stop":844.796,"duration":7.84},{"text":"It is uniformly been held that evidence known to the defendant or discoverable in the exercise of due diligence, cannot supply the basis for a new trial.","start":844.796,"stop":853.109,"duration":8.31},{"text":"There is no reason to depart from that simply because of Brady claim was involved.","start":853.109,"stop":857.476,"duration":4.37},{"text":"Indeed, it is highly inappropriate to do so because the heart of the Brady claim relates to evidence in the exclusive possession of the Government.","start":857.476,"stop":865.729,"duration":8.25},{"text":"Now, let us assume, however, that at the evidence of Sewell’s criminal record can properly somehow be treated as newly discovered or that the requirement of new discovery can be dispensed with, Court must next consider in any new trial motion on the basis of newly discovered evidence, what the proper standard is for assessing the sufficiency of the particular piece of evidence to warrant a new trial.","start":865.729,"stop":888.949,"duration":23.22},{"text":"Now, ordinarily when the evidence is simply uncovered and it was unknown to anyone prior to the trial, the standard is whether the evidence would probably result in a different verdict on re-trial, this is an ancient and nearly uniformly followed standard.","start":888.949,"stop":906.464,"duration":17.52},{"text":"That standard fully accounts for the balance that we have struck in our system between the undeniably important interest that convictions of innocent persons not to be permitted to stand, and on the other hand, the interest in the finality of judgment survive that after fair trials.","start":906.464,"stop":924.798,"duration":18.33},{"text":"No one seriously suggests that respondent can meet that standard in this case.","start":924.798,"stop":929.467,"duration":4.67},{"text":"If she is to get a new trial therefore, it is not because of concern that she maybe innocent, but because of other policies.","start":929.467,"stop":937.501,"duration":8.03},{"text":"Now, to sharpen the focus, the question is what bearing does the fact that the prosecutor possessed the particular piece of evidence in question here, have on the standard to be applied, in determining whether the evidence supports a new trial?","start":937.501,"stop":952.603,"duration":15.1},{"text":"The Court of Appeals plainly believed that that fact alone sufficed to justify a new trial in the most generous possible standard, that is whether the evidence might have affect of the jury’s verdict.","start":952.603,"stop":964.956,"duration":12.35},{"text":"We say that that fact standing alone has no effect, that further questions must be asked, that is did the prosecutor’s failure to disclose constitute a breach of duty on his part?","start":964.956,"stop":977.405,"duration":12.45},{"text":"Only if that question can be answered affirmatively, is there any justification to depart from the normal standards for awarding new trials on the basis of newly discovered evidence, because only then can it be said that the trial that did take place was in effect with unfairness and only then can it be thought that the award of a new trial might serve a useful function in shaping future prosecutorial behavior.","start":977.405,"stop":1004.423,"duration":27.02},{"text":"Now, this analysis that I am propounding, some of the commentators have suggested that it is inconsistent with certain language in this Court’s decision in Brady against Maryland.","start":1004.423,"stop":1016.555,"duration":12.13},{"text":"Specifically what the Court said in summarizing its holding was that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process, when the evidence is materialized to guilt or punishment and here are the important words, “irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”","start":1016.555,"stop":1037.016,"duration":20.46},{"text":"Now, in Levine against Clark, the majority took the view that that language meant that the more generous standard of awarding a new trial as not to turn on prosecutorial misconduct, but simply to turn on consideration of whether the evidence might have helped the defendant, had not been introduced at the original trial and we think that is incorrect.","start":1037.016,"stop":1061.681,"duration":24.66},{"text":"First of all, the language applies only when there is a defense request.","start":1061.681,"stop":1065.815,"duration":4.13},{"text":"The defense request in some sense maybe viewed as taking the place off or imposing an additional duty on the prosecutor, and therefore, relieving the Court of the obligation to make a determination about his subjective state of mind.","start":1065.815,"stop":1079.625,"duration":13.81},{"text":"In any event, we think what that language means is that you judge the prosecutor’s conduct not by having to find subjective bad faith, not by having to find willful misconduct, but by looking at the known facts and determining whether objectively viewed, those facts show a departure from his duties.","start":1079.625,"stop":1100.965,"duration":21.34},{"text":"This is the same standard that is used in conventional negligence law.","start":1100.965,"stop":1105.1,"duration":4.13},{"text":"It is still requires that he had a duty to disclose.","start":1105.1,"stop":1108.074,"duration":2.97},{"text":"If he had no duty to disclose that he breached, it is simply pointless to award new trials by virtue of what turns out then to be a wholly fortuitous fact that he had the piece of paper in his file that contained this evidence.","start":1108.074,"stop":1123.393,"duration":15.32},{"text":"Now, if we agree thus far that the prosecutor must have breached the duty of disclosure, we next suggest that the presence or absence of a meaningfully specific defense request is a central importance in defining the prosecutor’s duty of disclosure.","start":1123.393,"stop":1141.862,"duration":18.47},{"text":"Now, let us be clear about what I am contending here.","start":1141.862,"stop":1145.957,"duration":4.1},{"text":"If the prosecutor has willfully suppressed evidence, acted with mens rea, a request would be unnecessary.","start":1145.957,"stop":1155.884,"duration":9.93},{"text":"Moreover as Judge Friendly has indicated in the Keogh case and has come to be generally accepted in the Second Circuit and a number of other Courts, if the evidences of such obvious exculpatory value that it could not have escaped the prosecutor’s attention even without a request, then, there would be justification in those
