Bork","textObjs":[{"text":"That is correct.","start":219.686,"stop":220.947,"duration":1.26},{"text":"But coming to the opposite conclusion, we prepared the brief on jurisdiction issue and served the typed script on respondent’s counsel a week ago and obviously they should have time to reply in a brief to our --","start":220.947,"stop":233.782,"duration":12.84}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Now be given time?","start":233.782,"stop":234.654,"duration":0.87}]},{"speakerName":"Robert H.

jurisdictional argument made in that supplemental brief.","start":240.172,"stop":246.02,"duration":5.85},{"text":"So I would to like to maybe outline it and spend most of my time if I may on the due process question where I believe there may be something to add to the brief.","start":246.02,"stop":254.416,"duration":8.4},{"text":"The jurisdictional problem is this.","start":254.416,"stop":257.764,"duration":3.35},{"text":"The relevant statute is Section 205 of the Social Security Act codified as 42 U.S.C. 405 and 205 (h) which was involved in Salfi as it is here states that no findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided.","start":257.764,"stop":293.84,"duration":36.08},{"text":"Now, in Salfi, this Court concluded that 205(h) precludes the assertion of District Court jurisdiction except insofar as jurisdiction is then provided in Section 205 (g) and if we turn to 205 (g), we see that it confers jurisdiction upon District Courts to review any final decision of the secretary made after a hearing.","start":293.84,"stop":319.778,"duration":25.94},{"text":"Those provisions were not dispositive in Salfi, but they seem to be here.","start":319.778,"stop":323.776,"duration":4},{"text":"In Salfi, the only issue was a constitutional issue whether a categorization made by a statute was a constitutional categorization.","start":323.776,"stop":333.701,"duration":9.93},{"text":"So that it would have been as the court said futile and wasteful to require the claimant to exhaust the administrative process and it also decided, the Court also said that the secretary had decided that the reconsideration decision involved in Salfi was final.","start":333.701,"stop":350.171,"duration":16.47},{"text":"Now, neither of these grounds is present in this case.","start":350.171,"stop":353.033,"duration":2.86},{"text":"Here the secretary did not base his decision on a statutory probation or statutory categorization of eligibility which is subject to the constitutional attack, but upon a factual the termination that this respondent was in medical effect no longer disabled.","start":353.033,"stop":372.638,"duration":19.6},{"text":"And it would not have been futile and wasteful to ask this respondent to exhaust its administrative remedies which is I say would have included an oral hearing.","start":372.638,"stop":382.26,"duration":9.62},{"text":"Moreover, the secretary has not here determined that the order terminating disability benefits was final.","start":382.26,"stop":388.078,"duration":5.82},{"text":"He was entitled to administrative reconsideration, to an evidentiary hearing and so forth.","start":388.078,"stop":392.903,"duration":4.83},{"text":"He availed himself of none of this, but brought suit before the secretary had made a final decision after a hearing.","start":392.903,"stop":401.281,"duration":8.38},{"text":"Since 205 (g) does not confer jurisdiction under these circumstances, 205 (h) bars the assertion of jurisdiction by the District Court.","start":401.281,"stop":411.555,"duration":10.27},{"text":"I think there is no mere technicality.","start":411.555,"stop":413.951,"duration":2.4},{"text":"It is important to judicial administration of course that administration remedies be exhausted, even when not required by statute, and here at Congress has specifically mandated the exhaustion of administrative remedies.","start":413.951,"stop":426.343,"duration":12.39},{"text":"I should like now to turn to the merits of respondent’s constitutional claim about due process.","start":426.343,"stop":433.38,"duration":7.04},{"text":"The issue is whether he is entitled as a matter of due process to a full oral evidentiary hearing before any benefits paid to him under the disability insurance program may be stopped.","start":433.38,"stop":445.499,"duration":12.12},{"text":"The considerations to be weighed in making that decision of course are well known.","start":445.499,"stop":448.575,"duration":3.08},{"text":"They were outlined in Cafeteria Workers against McElroy and stated the number of later cases.","start":448.575,"stop":454.629,"duration":6.05},{"text":"What constitutes constitutional due process in a given context depends upon intensely practical considerations peculiar to that case and that process and the balancing of the governmental interests and the private interests that are affected.","start":454.629,"stop":470.781,"duration":16.15},{"text":"We are in effect dealing with a cost benefit judgment and so view the question becomes really how many -- the decision of this case will have a heavy impact upon the decision of how many decisional processes of government must be conform to a judicial model rather than to an administrative model.","start":470.781,"stop":491.958,"duration":21.18},{"text":"I think that is important and I think clearly there has to be stopping point somewhere to the imposition of judicial models upon the governmental decision making because it is very expensive and in some circumstances which I would contend, this is one, adds little or nothing to the alternative procedures provided.","start":491.958,"stop":510.748,"duration":18.79},{"text":"Now --","start":510.748,"stop":511.755,"duration":1.01}]},{"speakerName":"Potter

Bork","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, and I supposed it is socially expensive because I think in this case for example if one were required to continue payments until an oral evidentiary hearing could be had, one would pay a lot of money to beneficiaries who claim the hearing only for the purpose of keeping the payments going and I think that imposes a social cost independent of money upon the erosion of individual character.","start":524.279,"stop":550.897,"duration":26.62},{"text":"But in this case which involves one of these massive programs with thousands -- hundreds of thousands determinations in it, I think we face something not like the ordinary hearing due process case although of course this Court has had cases similar to this before.","start":550.897,"stop":569.443,"duration":18.55},{"text":"But it is crucial here I think to understand --","start":569.443,"stop":572.169,"duration":2.73}]},{"speakerName":"William J. Brennan, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"I have a question Solicitor General, was this issue before us, we did not reach it or something in similar --?","start":572.169,"stop":577.389,"duration":5.22}]},{"speakerName":"Robert H. Bork","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, in Richards against Wright, I believe Mr. Justice Brennan, although these are the procedures that have just been instituted prior to oral argument in Richards against Wright.","start":577.389,"stop":586.334,"duration":8.94}]},{"speakerName":"William J. Brennan, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"We sent the case back for reconsideration in light of new procedures?","start":586.334,"stop":590.434,"duration":4.1}]},{"speakerName":"Robert H. Bork","textObjs":[{"text":"That is correct.","start":590.434,"stop":590.962,"duration":0.53},{"text":"Well, I think the thought was that the claimant there might actually under the new procedures be paid and the case would be mooted by that.","start":590.962,"stop":600.983,"duration":10.02}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"And these are those new procedures?","start":600.983,"stop":602.763,"duration":1.78}]},{"speakerName":"Robert H. Bork","textObjs":[{"text":"These are the new procedures Mr. Justice Stewart.","start":602.763,"stop":606.786,"duration":4.02},{"text":"And I think it is important to see the kinds of safeguards they provide and the kinds of results they produce.","start":606.786,"stop":616.543,"duration":9.76},{"text":"The act provides that the initial determination after a man has been qualified, a worker has been qualified for disability payments, he is told if there is any possibility of recovery from his medical disability that he will examined to see if recovery has occurred because if disability ceases, the payments cease and the Congress has mandated that state agencies were used for making the initial the termination about the cessation of disability.","start":616.543,"stop":644.332,"duration":27.79},{"text":"And the reason for that is they want to draw these workers into vocational rehabilitation therapy and training and those are primarily the state agencies that are used for this purpose.","start":644.332,"stop":654.847,"duration":10.51},{"text":"So that a state agency, working under standards and procedures laid down by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare requests the worker to supply information periodically on a questionnaire that shows his present condition, his medical treatment and medical restriction placed upon him and so forth.","start":654.847,"stop":671.962,"duration":17.12},{"text":"If that questionnaire does not show clear cut recovery, the state agency then obtains information from the treating physician of the claimant.","start":671.962,"stop":681.789,"duration":9.83},{"text":"It may obtain independent consulting examinations.","start":681.789,"stop":685.483,"duration":3.69},{"text":"In this case of course the initial the termination was made up of the basis of a previous medical record which was on the files.","start":685.483,"stop":692.222,"duration":6.74},{"text":"The respondent’s current answers to the questionnaire about his condition, the current report of his treating physician and the report of an independent psychiatric consultant who was called in by the agency.","start":692.222,"stop":704.985,"duration":12.76},{"text":"Now, this material when it is gathered, is then reviewed by a state agency team which consists of another physician and a trained disability examiner.","start":704.985,"stop":715.818,"duration":10.83},{"text":"If the worker is no longer disabled in their opinion after examining his record and I should say that the only issue is one in fact the medical, the statute requires that disability be proved or disapproved by medical evidence and not by other kinds of intuitions, as evidence that is well presented in other words in a written record.","start":715.818,"stop":740.338,"duration":24.52},{"text":"If they decide that that claimant is probably not disabled and they think he is not then form of that tentative conclusion, they provide him with a summary of the evidence and they provide ten days for him to respond in writing and they tell him that if he wishes additional time because of the difficulty of procuring the evidence he needs he may have it.","start":740.338,"stop":761.995,"duration":21.66},{"text":"They also tell him he can get his questions answered at the Local Social Security Office.","start":761.995,"stop":767.546,"duration":5.55},{"text":"Now here, as at all of the stages of this process, the worker is entitled to be assisted by a counsel or by any other representative that he chooses, it is often is by Union Representatives or somebody of that sort and that person is entitled to examine all the evidence in the file including the medical evidence.","start":767.546,"stop":784.256,"duration":16.71},{"text":"Respondent here declined to offer any additional evidence other than to assert that he did not have a back sprain, he actually had arthritis of the spine.","start":784.256,"stop":791.791,"duration":7.54},{"text":"Many workers do offer additional evidence and often get the initial the termination of no disability reverses.","start":791.791,"stop":799.948,"duration":8.16},{"text":"But if the tentative conclusion of the state examining team is not changed, the report is forwarded to the Social Security Administrations Bureau of Disability Insurance where it is reviewed to make sure that it is in conformity with National standards.","start":799.948,"stop":815.196,"duration":15.25},{"text":"If that office thinks that perhaps the decision should have been favorable to the work, but was not, it has no legal power to change it, but it may and does send the case back for reconsideration and I believe about half of the cases in fact for reconsideration are reconsidered favorably to the worker.","start":815.196,"stop":832.848,"duration":17.65},{"text":"If however the Social Security Administration accepts the the termination of no disability, it notifies the worker in writing, states the basis for its initial determination and specifies his right to seek further review.","start":832.848,"stop":847.693,"duration":14.85},{"text":"At that stage, benefits are terminated although there is a two-month grace period.","start":847.693,"stop":852.521,"duration":4.83},{"text":"After the month in which he ceased to be disabled, that grace period may sometimes run by them or it may still have some time to run.","start":852.521,"stop":862.781,"duration":10.26},{"text":"Respondent of course at this stage filed suit.","start":862.781,"stop":866.098,"duration":3.32},{"text":"He had a right to the following additional remedies which he did not elect to take.","start":866.098,"stop":871.245,"duration":5.15},{"text":"He can ask for a reconsideration, he gets it automatically.","start":871.245,"stop":875.438,"duration":4.19},{"text":"That means that a wholly different team of physician and examiner at the state agency review the record de novo, consider any additional evidence submitted by the worker or obtained by the state agency such as another medical examination and that decision is again sent for review to the Social security administration.","start":875.438,"stop":895.286,"duration":19.85},{"text":"There is a reversal right that is significant at the reconsideration stage.","start":895.286,"stop":900.239,"duration":4.95},{"text":"If the result is again adverse to the worker he can get an evidentiary hearing before a Social Security Administrative Judge. He may, but he need not appear personally.","start":900.239,"stop":911.941,"duration":11.7},{"text":"Social security Administration is not represented by counsel or by staff.","start":911.941,"stop":915.378,"duration":3.44},{"text":"It is not an adversary hearing.","start":915.378,"stop":917.443,"duration":2.06}]},{"speakerName":"Lewis F.
