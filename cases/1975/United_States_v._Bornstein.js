fraudulent supply of non-conforming electron tubes for use in army radio communications kits.","start":53.793,"stop":65.758,"duration":11.96},{"text":"The facts were as follows; in 1962, the signal supply agency, acting on behalf of the Department of the Army, entered into a contract with a private company, Model Engineering and Manufacturing Corporation, for the supply of radio kit sets.","start":65.758,"stop":84.325,"duration":18.57},{"text":"Each set was to contain a transmitter, a receiver, a power supply, transformer, and radio accessory kit.","start":84.325,"stop":93.89,"duration":9.56},{"text":"A radio accessory kits operated with 4X150G electron tubes, the Contract required that these be “JAN” branded.","start":93.89,"stop":104.593,"duration":10.7},{"text":"“JAN”, J-A-N is an acronym standing for Joint Army Navy.","start":104.593,"stop":111.454,"duration":6.86},{"text":"The manufacturer is authorized to use the JAN designation, only after its manufacturing process has passed certain Government test for quality control and the tubes themselves pass certain Government inspection tests.","start":111.454,"stop":126.411,"duration":14.96},{"text":"Thus by calling for JAN tubes in the contract, the contract in effect require the furnishing of tubes that were certified as having met certain Government standards as to both manufacture and performance.","start":126.411,"stop":142.724,"duration":16.31},{"text":"The requirement of JAN tubes in the contract can therefore be seen to be more than a mere technical formality, although the record is silent on this point, it may reasonably be inferred that the radio sets, which as I have indicated, included both receiver and transmitter will be used for the Army for field communications, and that a tube failure can impair the military operations that might be dependent upon such communications.","start":142.724,"stop":171.253,"duration":28.53},{"text":"The rigid quality control and performance standards, represented by JAN branding, is therefore served to minimize the risk of such a tube failure.","start":171.253,"stop":181.55,"duration":10.3},{"text":"This consideration I believe, indicates the practical importance of the contractual requirement that the tubes to be supplied would be JAN tubes, and it also underlines the seriousness of the respondents’ fraud, which I will now describe.","start":181.55,"stop":198.888,"duration":17.34},{"text":"The respondents who are the owners and operators of a corporation, United National Labs, that entered into a contract with the prime contractor, Model Engineering for the supply of the JAN tubes called for by the contract.","start":198.888,"stop":215.45,"duration":16.56},{"text":"It is undisputed in this case that the respondents caused and are responsible for all the acts of their corporation, United National

corporation to the respondents as well.","start":215.45,"stop":240.504,"duration":25.05},{"text":"The respondents were dealers in electron tubes and they entered into the subcontract with Model

entered into this subcontract, the prevailing market price for JAN tubes of the type specified in the contract was approximately $40.00 per tube.","start":253.652,"stop":266.088,"duration":12.44},{"text":"Instead of buying and supplying these kinds of tubes, the respondents instead bought cheaper tubes at prices ranging from $15.00 to $18.00 and they falsely stamped each tube with a JAN designation.","start":266.088,"stop":281.239,"duration":15.15},{"text":"As we have here a case of fraud, pure and simple, committed solely for the purpose of making a dishonest profit.","start":281.239,"stop":289.218,"duration":7.98},{"text":"The respondents made three shipments of a total of 397 falsely branded tubes, the tubes were packaged in 21 separate boxes, and each box was accompanied by a packing list to which the respondents have fixed a false government inspection stamp.","start":289.218,"stop":307.945,"duration":18.73},{"text":"The respondents billed Model Engineering, the prime contractor for the tubes, on three separate invoices.","start":307.945,"stop":316.063,"duration":8.12},{"text":"In turn Model Engineering incorporated these tubes into the radio kit sets that it supplied to the Army, and it billed the Army for the tubes on 35 separate invoices or claims for payment.","start":316.063,"stop":330.349,"duration":14.29},{"text":"Each of these claims for payment represented falsely because of the respondents’ fraud, that the electron tubes furnished in the radio kit sets were Government inspected JAN tubes.","start":330.349,"stop":343.938,"duration":13.59},{"text":"The Government paid these 35 claims for payment.","start":343.938,"stop":348.837,"duration":4.9},{"text":"When respondents’ fraud was subsequently discovered after some negotiation, Model Engineering, the prime contractor, paid the Government a total of a little bit more than $16,000.00 for the breach of contract that had been occasioned by the respondents’
