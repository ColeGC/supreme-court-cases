Nabrit, III","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":51.794,"stop":54.518,"duration":2.72},{"text":"In 1972, Congress amended Title VII of the 1965 Civil Rights Act to authorized federal employees who have been the victims of employment discrimination to sue under Title VII.","start":54.518,"stop":66.117,"duration":11.6},{"text":"That amendment precipitated a number of suits by aggrieved federal employees both under Title VII and as in the instant case, under other statutes, particularly the 1866 Civil Rights Act which is now codified as 42 U.S.C. Section 1981.","start":66.117,"stop":82.13,"duration":16.01},{"text":"In the resulting litigation, the government has raised a number of procedural issues as to what judicial remedies shall be enjoyed by federal employees.","start":82.13,"stop":91.892,"duration":9.76},{"text":"By and large, these are the same procedural issues that were raised in the past by private employers also seeking to defend Title VII or Section 1981 actions.","start":91.892,"stop":102.504,"duration":10.61},{"text":"This case presents two of those issues.","start":102.504,"stop":105.736,"duration":3.23},{"text":"In July of 1971, petitioner filed an administrative complaint with the General Services Administration, alleging that his superiors had denied him a promotion on account of his race.","start":105.736,"stop":117.265,"duration":11.53},{"text":"In March of 1973, after almost two years of administrative proceedings, the agency found itself innocent of those charges.","start":117.265,"stop":126.487,"duration":9.22},{"text":"Having thus obtained final agency action, petitioner sued on May 7, 1973 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.","start":126.487,"stop":135.991,"duration":9.5},{"text":"Jurisdiction was alleged to exist under a variety statutes, including Section 1981.","start":135.991,"stop":141.484,"duration":5.49},{"text":"The government moved to dismiss on the grounds that none of the statutes alleged, on their face confer jurisdiction over the claim at issue.","start":141.484,"stop":150.601,"duration":9.12},{"text":"On appeal, two somewhat different arguments were raised in the Second Circuit.","start":150.601,"stop":155.985,"duration":5.38},{"text":"First, that the 1866 Civil Rights Act insofar as it conferred jurisdiction over federal employees’ claims of employment discrimination, and then repealed by Congress in 1972 when it amended Title VII.","start":155.985,"stop":170.465,"duration":14.48},{"text":"And second, it was suggested that prior to suit under Section 1981, an employee, at least of the federal government must pursue his administrative remedy such as they are all the way through the Appeals Review Board.","start":170.465,"stop":185.474,"duration":15.01},{"text":"The Court of Appeals accepted both of these contentions and affirmed the dismissal.","start":185.474,"stop":190.726,"duration":5.25},{"text":"We sought certiorari, stressing that the decision of the Court of Appeals with regard to rights of federal employees was in conflict with the decisions of a number of circuits and of this Court, particularly with the right of private employees under the same circumstances.","start":190.726,"stop":206.163,"duration":15.44},{"text":"Subsequent to the grant of certiorari and to the Court of Appeals decision, this Court decided Johnson against the Railway Express Agency and held, with regard to private employees who sued under 1981, that 1981 was not repealed by Title VII and that there is no obligation to exhaust the Title VII administrative procedures and indeed, under certain circumstances, that it is not permissible to try do so.","start":206.163,"stop":229.959,"duration":23.8},{"text":"We believe that in that regard Johnson was correctly decided and should be applied here.","start":229.959,"stop":235.206,"duration":5.25},{"text":"Our brief spells out a variety of statutes other than Title VII, affording varying remedies to federal employees who have been victims of unlawful employment discrimination.","start":235.206,"stop":247.067,"duration":11.86},{"text":"The most important of these is Section 1981 which is, indeed the same jurisdictional basis as was discussed this morning in Washington against Davis.","start":247.067,"stop":257.151,"duration":10.08},{"text":"The scheme which we have laid out presents, we think, the same pattern of independent overlapping remedies that exists for private employees who are aggrieved by employment discrimination.","start":257.151,"stop":269.548,"duration":12.4},{"text":"The government maintains, however, that all of these statutes and particularly the 1866 Civil Rights Act were tacitly repealed by Congress in 1972 when it adapted the amendment to Title VII which I have mentioned.","start":269.548,"stop":283.413,"duration":13.87},{"text":"In dealing with this contention, the Court happily does not have to write on a blank slate.","start":283.413,"stop":288.443,"duration":5.03},{"text":"For this is not the first time that the suggestion have been raised in this Court that the 1866 Civil Rights Act has been repealed pro tanto by more recent legislation.","start":288.443,"stop":298.679,"duration":10.24},{"text":"To be exact, this is the fourth time in a decade that that contention has been raised here.","start":298.679,"stop":303.184,"duration":4.51},{"text":"In Jones against the Alfred Mayer Co. it was argued that the 1866 Civil Rights Act insofar as it created a cause of action for individuals aggrieved by housing discrimination had been repealed by Title VIII of the 1868 Civil Rights Act.","start":303.184,"stop":318.722,"duration":15.54},{"text":"This Court rejected that contention.","start":318.722,"stop":320.639,"duration":1.92},{"text":"A similar contention was raised in Sullivan against Little Hunting Park with regard to the 1866 Civil Rights Act insofar as it gave a cause of action for a victim of discrimination of public accommodations, and again that argument was rejected.","start":320.639,"stop":333.361,"duration":12.72},{"text":"And of course, most recently in Johnson against REA, the Court held that the passage of Title VII did not repeal 1981 insofar as it created a cause of action for private employees.","start":333.361,"stop":346.587,"duration":13.23},{"text":"We think that these cases are correct and that the reasons in them should be applied here.","start":346.587,"stop":351.798,"duration":5.21},{"text":"The statute involved which is Section 717 of Title VII does not purport on its face to repeal anything.","start":351.798,"stop":359.605,"duration":7.81},{"text":"It simply provides in two sentences that federal employee shall have the right to sue after certain administrative procedures have been followed and provides that, by reference to the other provisions of Title VII, the procedures once in court shall be essentially the same as the procedures afforded to private plaintiffs.","start":359.605,"stop":380.783,"duration":21.18},{"text":"In our judgment, that language of the statute is essentially the end of the Court’s inquiry.","start":380.783,"stop":386.653,"duration":5.87},{"text":"This Court in Morton against Mancari held that a clear and unequivocal congressional intent was required in order for the Court to include that Congress had sub silentio repealed earlier legislation.","start":386.653,"stop":401.624,"duration":14.97},{"text":"That rule, of course, goes back at least a century and there is nothing here to justify any such finding of repeal.","start":401.624,"stop":409.077,"duration":7.45},{"text":"Throughout the legislative history of the 1972 amendments, no one in the Senate or the House, no witness, and no report with an exception I shall come to, made any mention of repealing anything, suggested that any rights of federal employees might have, might be excessive or suggested that they thought that Title VII in any regard ought to be an exclusive remedy.","start":409.077,"stop":431.136,"duration":22.06},{"text":"The exception, of course is the amendment proposed by Senator Roscoe in the senate which would have expressly made Title VII an exclusive remedy, and that amendment was rejected.","start":431.136,"stop":441.483,"duration":10.35},{"text":"We think, for this reason, that the Court of Appeals was wrong, including that Section 1981 has been repealed and that that statute as indeed the other statues involved still exist and can be relied on by federal employers.","start":441.483,"stop":456.335,"duration":14.85}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

important.","start":758.819,"stop":764.087,"duration":5.27},{"text":"In June of 1971, petitioner came forward and affirmatively complained of employment discrimination, in that instance too an EEO Counselor.","start":764.087,"stop":774.152,"duration":10.07},{"text":"That complaint, however, under the regulations was not sufficient to trigger a plenary Civil Service Commission

received.","start":785.417,"stop":798.881,"duration":13.46},{"text":"That second act, however, was also not sufficient to trigger plenary inquiry.","start":798.881,"stop":803.178,"duration":4.3},{"text":"All it got petitioner was a letter, a permission to file a written complaint.","start":803.178,"stop":807.63,"duration":4.45},{"text":"That written complaint was filed in July 15, 1971.","start":807.63,"stop":812.02,"duration":4.39},{"text":"At the time the complaint was filed, the government’s own regulations required that any administrative complaint of employment discrimination be processed through final agency action within 60 days.","start":812.02,"stop":824.315,"duration":12.3},{"text":"617 days later, on March 23, 1973, a final agency action occurred and the general service administration concluded that it not been guilty of employment discrimination as petitioner charged.","start":824.315,"stop":840.275,"duration":15.96},{"text":"At that point, to be sure as now, the regulations did not purport to require a complainant to process that appeal the one remaining step which existed, namely to the Appeals Review Board of the Civil Service Commission.","start":840.275,"stop":854.657,"duration":14.38},{"text":"Plaintiff, thereupon, sued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.","start":854.657,"stop":860.234,"duration":5.58},{"text":"At the time, it was asserted and not denied that by proceeding all the way through final agency action, petitioner had adequately exhausted administrative remedies.","start":860.234,"stop":870.41,"duration":10.18},{"text":"The government did not deny that in the District Court and indeed, in the Court of Appeals in its briefs did not deny that contention.","start":870.41,"stop":876.924,"duration":6.51},{"text":"However, in June of 1974 oral argument, the government advanced what I characterize as its first exhaustion rule, namely that a federal employee had to pursue any claim of employment discrimination all the way through the Appeals Review Board and essentially without exception.","start":876.924,"stop":895.409,"duration":18.49},{"text":"Second, in opposing certiorari in March of 1975, the government suggested a second rule, namely that an aggrieved employee could sue after final agency action, but only if he did so within 30 days of that action.","start":895.409,"stop":910.106,"duration":14.7},{"text":"And finally in its brief filed on October of 1975, a full 29 months after this suit was begun, the government suggested yet a third rule, namely that an aggrieved employee could sue if the government had delayed unduly in processing his complaint, provided he had exhausted his administrative remedies for such delay.","start":910.106,"stop":932.864,"duration":22.76},{"text":"None of these rules, of course were known or indeed foreseeable at the time when plaintiff decided to bring this action.","start":932.864,"stop":940.817,"duration":7.95},{"text":"The case in the briefs before the Court present a variety of possible rules that might be adapted with regard to exhaustion.","start":940.817,"stop":950.227,"duration":9.41},{"text":"The first rule, and one we think preferable, is not to require exhaustion at all for federal employees just as it is not required for state and local government employees or for private employees.","start":950.227,"stop":962.366,"duration":12.14},{"text":"A second possible rule suggested by the government’s brief in Chandler is that the government is entitled only to notice of the claim and to cooperation with any investigation the government chooses to pursue.","start":962.366,"stop":974.961,"duration":12.6},{"text":"That of course was given in this case.","start":974.961,"stop":977.789,"duration":2.83},{"text":"A third possible rule would be essentially congruent with that with regard to Title VII, namely that after final agency action, a federal employee is free to sue without further exhaustion or the Court might hold that after the completion of the 180-day deadline set by the government’s own regulations, an employee was free to sue.","start":977.789,"stop":999.13,"duration":21.34},{"text":"Fifth, the Court could, and I think it certainly would be required in any case, to adapt the rule that in any particular case an aggrieved employee would be entitled to show as to his particular case that further exhaustion would have been futile.","start":999.13,"stop":1016.941,"duration":17.81}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

Court.","start":12.98,"stop":15.54,"duration":2.56},{"text":"Yesterday, I delineated several possible rules that the Court might adapt with regard to the question of exhaustion in Section 1981 cases brought by federal employees.","start":15.54,"stop":27.204,"duration":11.66},{"text":"We believe that the Court should adapt among these the same rule that was adapted by this Court last term in Johnson against the Railway Express Agency.","start":27.204,"stop":38,"duration":10.8},{"text":"As you recall in Johnson, the issue was whether an employee of the REA who wanted to sue under Section 1981 should or indeed could, postpone that Section 1981 action until he had exhausted the administrative remedies created by Title VII.","start":38,"stop":57.621,"duration":19.62},{"text":"This Court held unanimously that such an employee need not exhaust those remedies and, indeed, under certain circumstances could not postpone this 1981 action while he did so.","start":57.621,"stop":69.595,"duration":11.97},{"text":"We believe the same rule should be applied to federal employees and we ground that contention on a variety of considerations.","start":69.595,"stop":77.714,"duration":8.12},{"text":"First, as this Court noted in Morton against Mancari, Congress in 1972 concluded that the administrative procedure which is involved here was ineffective for the most part and had served to impede rather than advance the congressional and national policy of eliminating discrimination in employment.","start":77.714,"stop":97.979,"duration":20.27},{"text":"That congressional determination, of course, was based on extensive hearings and a broad factual inquiry.","start":97.979,"stop":104.512,"duration":6.53},{"text":"In 1975, the Commission on Civil Rights conducted a similar extensive inquiry and also reached the same conclusion, namely, that the administrative procedures involved had not changed since Congress’ first investigation and that they continue to fail to afford to federal employees a meaningful and fair opportunity for vindication of their claims of employment discrimination.","start":104.512,"stop":130.244,"duration":25.73},{"text":"We believe that these findings should be accepted by the Court and that they undercut completely any basis for exhaustion rule under these circumstances.","start":130.244,"stop":139.842,"duration":9.6},{"text":"We believe that the policy of exhaustion fundamentally rests on there being a reasonable possibility that the pursuit of the procedure involved will in fact yield the relief that the employee wants, and therefore, obviate the need for judicial intervention.","start":139.842,"stop":157.114,"duration":17.27},{"text":"There simply is no realistic possibility that that will occur in the administrative process.","start":157.114,"stop":163.069,"duration":5.95},{"text":"And in that regard, this case of course presents a somewhat unique situation because normally we do not have these kinds of findings by the Congress or the Civil Rights Commission as to the defects in the procedure and because of those findings, we think that any presumption that the process -- cases simply cannot be indulged in.","start":163.069,"stop":184.031,"duration":20.96},{"text":"Second, even without regard to those findings, any federal employee who sued prior to proceeding all the way through the administrative process would be entitled to claim that, in fact, it would have been futile for him to do so or to go further than he did.","start":184.031,"stop":200.114,"duration":16.08},{"text":"And in view of the congressional and commission findings, that he would certainly be able to establish a prima facie case on it.","start":200.114,"stop":206.693,"duration":6.58},{"text":"And so, we find that the Courts in any one of these cases was involved in a complex and time-consuming factual inquiry as to whether or not further proceedings would have been warranted.","start":206.693,"stop":216.555,"duration":9.86},{"text":"For example, in this case, it might be possible to have a trial as to whether or not going to the Appeals Review Board would be efficacious.","start":216.555,"stop":224.436,"duration":7.88},{"text":"We think, for the reasons set out by the Court in Alexander versus Gardner-Denver that it makes more sense for the Court simply o
