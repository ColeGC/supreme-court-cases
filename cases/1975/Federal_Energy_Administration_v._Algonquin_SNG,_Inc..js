in the 1954 Code and it is contained in Chapter 76 of subtitle (f) which is now -- Section 7851 of that code which is quoted at page 20, footnote 13 of our brief, our main brief, provides that subtitle (f) which includes the Anti-Injunction Act applies to any tax imposed by this Title and of course the fees at issue here are not imposed by that Title.","start":125.962,"stop":161.442,"duration":35.48},{"text":"There is says, the subtitle (f) does not apply to taxes imposed under the 1939 Code except as subsections (b) and (c) provide and subsection (c) provides, in fact that Chapter 76 of subtitle (f) applies to the 39 code and that carries with the Anti-Injunction Act.","start":161.442,"stop":181.052,"duration":19.61},{"text":"So, I think the clear implication is that the Anti-Injunction Act applies outside the 54 Code only when specifically made applicable and it is specifically made applicable only to the 1939 code.","start":181.052,"stop":194.215,"duration":13.16},{"text":"Hence we think it is not applicable of the fees here, whichever else they are, certainly note taxes imposed by the 1954 Code of the 1939 Code.","start":194.215,"stop":203.07,"duration":8.85},{"text":"Respondents have made additional arguments in this direction in their brief and we can accept one of them and we prefer not to accept the other.","start":203.07,"stop":210.008,"duration":6.94},{"text":"Their first argument is that these fees are not taxes and hence do not fall under the Anti-Injunction Act.","start":210.008,"stop":215.325,"duration":5.32},{"text":"That argument is in some attention with their argument later on in the brief that they are taxes and cannot be delegated, but in any event, we agree that they are not taxes and do not fall under the Anti-Injunction Act for that reason.","start":215.325,"stop":227.13,"duration":11.81},{"text":"The other argument is that the Anti-Injunction Act would not apply to a petition for review FEA regulations in the Court of Appeals because Court of Appeals' jurisdiction for that purpose is given by the FEA Act.","start":227.13,"stop":242.934,"duration":15.8},{"text":"However, the repeal of the statute in a policy is so basic as that expressed in the Anti-Injunction Act that I think are going to be expressed and there are certainly no intimation that those are to repeal the Anti-Injunction Act in the FEA Act.","start":242.934,"stop":256.43,"duration":13.5},{"text":"So that I think that argument is incorrect, but the other two I think are correct in support of the notion that there is no application of the Anti-Injunction Act here.","start":256.43,"stop":266.006,"duration":9.58},{"text":"With that I would like to turn to the merits if I may and discussed directly the President’s power under Section 232 (b) to impose license fees for the importation of foreign oil and perhaps I should say a word about why the President shifted from the imposition of quotas to the use of license fees.","start":266.006,"stop":286.659,"duration":20.65},{"text":"Quotas have been used for some time in this field and had been found rather unsatisfactory for one thing there are quite rigid.","start":286.659,"stop":294.478,"duration":7.82},{"text":"They specify particular amounts and as demand changes, domestic demand changes, they provide much too much protection for the domestic industry or much too little protection to domestic industry and it becomes an administrative nightmare constantly adjusting the size of a quarter, whereas a fee sets the margin of encouragement you wish to give to domestic industry, in this case for national security purposes, and as domestic demand changes, imports increase or decrease, but the margin remains there and you are given the amount of protection you desire.","start":294.478,"stop":331.401,"duration":36.92},{"text":"Well, Section 232 (b) states that the Secretary of the Treasury must advise the President when he so finds that an article is being imported in such quantities or in the said circumstances as to threaten to impair the National Security and the President unless he disagrees, shall take such action and for such time as he deems necessary to adjust the imports of such article and its derivatives, so that such import will not threaten to impair the national security.","start":331.401,"stop":361.096,"duration":29.69},{"text":"Here the finding was made by the Secretary of State concerning Oil and Petroleum Products.","start":361.096,"stop":365.867,"duration":4.77},{"text":"I should state in passing perhaps that this section of the statute has never been used in its history for any commodity other than oil.","start":365.867,"stop":374.621,"duration":8.75},{"text":"Here the Secretary of the Treasury made that finding, the President agreed and he placed license fees on importation of oil to lessen the amounts in which it was imported.","start":374.621,"stop":385.747,"duration":11.13},{"text":"Now, I take it that respondent do not challenge the finding that there was a threat to national security and indeed the language of the Court of Appeals suggest that they agreed that there was?","start":385.747,"stop":394.297,"duration":8.55},{"text":"So all we are talking about is the language of the statute.","start":394.297,"stop":398.983,"duration":4.69},{"text":"Now, I read the respondents in the Court of Appeals read it as if it said the President shall take such action as he deems necessary to adjust the imports provided that the only action he shall deem necessary as quotas.","start":398.983,"stop":415.138,"duration":16.15},{"text":"That is not what the statute says.","start":415.138,"stop":417.02,"duration":1.88},{"text":"If it were a quota statute only it would be quite easy to write it that way.","start":417.02,"stop":420.256,"duration":3.24},{"text":"Many delegations of power in this field are written as quotas.","start":420.256,"stop":424.899,"duration":4.64},{"text":"This is deliberately given very broad application, such action as he deemed necessary.","start":424.899,"stop":431.009,"duration":6.11},{"text":"So the plain text of the statute supports the President’s power to use license fees.","start":431.009,"stop":436.887,"duration":5.88},{"text":"They are certainly without doubt a means of adjusting imports.","start":436.887,"stop":439.606,"duration":2.72},{"text":"They have been used in the history of this Republic from the beginning, monetary exactions have been used from the beginning as a means of adjusting imports.","start":439.606,"stop":446.954,"duration":7.35},{"text":"Now, we turn to the legislative history, defined and it bears out that plain meaning of the statute rather clearly and I think no other conclusions is really possible.","start":446.954,"stop":454.302,"duration":7.35},{"text":"This national security provision appeared in this present form in the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955.","start":454.302,"stop":461.895,"duration":7.59},{"text":"The Senate Committee on Finance had before them number of proposals to control imports of various kinds of products.","start":461.895,"stop":468.727,"duration":6.83},{"text":"Oil was certainly by no means the only kind of product that was considered.","start":468.727,"stop":471.841,"duration":3.11},{"text":"There was zinc and lead, and fluorspar and so forth.","start":471.841,"stop":475.694,"duration":3.85},{"text":"Now, one of these amendments that was before them was by Senator Neely which provided for a quota system on oils in Section 1 and provided for a general power to take such action with respect to any products he thought necessary in Section 2.","start":475.694,"stop":491.338,"duration":15.64},{"text":"This was replaced, the Neely Amendment was replaced by what we have here which was then the Byrd-Millikin Amendment.","start":491.338,"stop":498.847,"duration":7.51},{"text":"Now, that was a compromise of all these raised proposals, some of them are giving broad power, some are requiring quotas, some of them applying to different products by name and the Byrd-Millikin Amendment is quite broad in the sense and it simply says when there is a finding by the Director of the Defense Mobilization about effective imports on national security being threatening, the President is given powers to take such actions as it is deemed necessary.","start":498.847,"stop":528.959,"duration":30.11},{"text":"So as to all products they adapted the second Section of the Neely Amendment as a compromise in this Byrd-Millikin Amendment, adapted the same form of approach.","start":528.959,"stop":537.636,"duration":8.68},{"text":"Now, the significance of that is when you realize that the Byrd-Millikin Amendment in this respect is identical to the approach of the Neely Amendment is that Senator Martin, who was a co-sponsor of Neely said that during the hearing that Neely gave the President the power to take such action as is necessary and that included the power to impose import quotas or to increase duties.","start":537.636,"stop":563.865,"duration":26.23},{"text":"Now, by a common utilitarian proposition, if the Neely Amendment gave that power in the Byrd-Millikin, it is the same as the Millikin Amendment, then the Byrd-Millikin Amendment which we have before us now in the form of 232 (b) gives that power to use monetary exactions, but there is more evidence.","start":563.865,"stop":582.063,"duration":18.2},{"text":"In the floor debate, Senator Millikin stated that his amendment gave the President the power not only to use quotas, but also to use tariffs and import taxes.","start":582.063,"stop":591.447,"duration":9.38},{"text":"Senator Barkley who was a member of the Finance Committee said the power is to use quotas or to take such other steps as the President deemed desirable, he clearly thought there was something other than quotas that could be used.","start":591.447,"stop":602.82,"duration":11.37},{"text":"Senator Bennett said the power included tariffs, quotas and stockpiling.","start":602.82,"stop":607.713,"duration":4.89},{"text":"Senator Byrd in the colloquy with Senator Saltonstall which the Court of Appeals misinterpreted said the Amendment put other commodities on the same basis as agricultural commodities were already on.","start":607.713,"stop":621.503,"duration":13.79},{"text":"Now, Senator Byrd have just been discussing with Senator Thye the President’s power under the Agricultural Adjustment Act to use duties as well as quotas to affect the size of imports.","start":621.503,"stop":633.131,"duration":11.63},{"text":"Now, respondents reply in their brief as I understand it is that in the discussion of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Senator Byrd referred to the use of quotas.","start":633.131,"stop":642.508,"duration":9.38},{"text":"I do not know what to make of that because the Act does provide for the use of duties for use of monetary exactions.","start":642.508,"stop":648.41,"duration":5.9},{"text":"Unless the respondents are suggesting that Senator Byrd did not understand the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and therefore, his misunderstanding of that Act must be carried over into the legislative history of this Act, but there is really no basis in the floor debate to say that Senator Byrd displayed a misunderstanding of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, it is an odd thing to attribute to him.","start":648.41,"stop":672.338,"duration":23.93}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"The Agricultural
