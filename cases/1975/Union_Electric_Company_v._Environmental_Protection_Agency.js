Ferrell","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.","start":11.245,"stop":18.353,"duration":7.11},{"text":"This case arose in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.","start":18.353,"stop":27.259,"duration":8.91},{"text":"It arose by a petition brought under the Judicial Review Section of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, to review the sulfur emission regulation in the Missouri Implementation Plan.","start":27.259,"stop":51.494,"duration":24.24},{"text":"Section 307 (b) (1) says that petitions may be brought within two different time periods.","start":51.494,"stop":63.236,"duration":11.74},{"text":"In the first place, the petition may be brought within 30 days after the administrator of the EPA approves the implementation plan.","start":63.236,"stop":77.244,"duration":14.01},{"text":"In that event, it is probable that there would be an administrative record which is susceptible of review by the Court of Appeals.","start":77.244,"stop":93.312,"duration":16.07},{"text":"The Section secondly says that petitions may be brought at a later date if tMr. Justice Rehnquisthey arise solely on grounds that have occurred more than 30 days after the EPA approved the state devised implementation plan.","start":93.312,"stop":121.011,"duration":27.7},{"text":"So far as we have been able to ascertain, this is the only case in the United States that has been brought more than 30 days after the EPA approved the implementation plan, and of course, brought on grounds that arose more than 30 days after such group.","start":121.011,"stop":149.926,"duration":28.91},{"text":"There were a substantial number of cases that have been filed within this initial 30-day period which in 99% of the cases occurred within the month of June 1972 and those cases have resulted in a apparently substantial number of opinions by the several United States Courts of Appeals and the various Circuits because this implementation plan review petitions must be brought in the appropriate Circuit, First to Tenth.","start":149.926,"stop":196.05,"duration":46.12},{"text":"The results have differed in those decisions and I think that it is the differing results that have occurred vis-à-vis themselves and the different result in many of those cases with the result reached by the Eighth Circuit in the instant case is now before Your Honors, there is the reason this case is here, that is the basis for us to grant of certiorari.","start":196.05,"stop":227.334,"duration":31.28},{"text":"Now, let us take a quick look at the allegations of the petitioner’s petition.","start":227.334,"stop":239.177,"duration":11.84},{"text":"Union Electric alleges that three of its base load electric generating plants and base load plants are the one that supply the bulk of the electricity, three of them, all located in the State of Missouri in the Eighth Circuit do not meet the sulfur emission regulation in the state devised implementation plan, that by EPA approval has become a federal law.","start":239.177,"stop":278.604,"duration":39.43},{"text":"We allege that grounds which of a reason more than 30 days after the EPA approval make it impossible for Union Electric on technical grounds to comply with this regulation and we allege that it would be manifestly against the public interest for Union Electric to make an attempt to comply.","start":278.604,"stop":315.38,"duration":36.78},{"text":"Now, going on a scientific possibility of compliance, I am not saying that it may work out, there are as far as we know and as far as we allege in the petition only two scientific basis of which a compliance could hope to be attempted.","start":315.38,"stop":337.746,"duration":22.37},{"text":"One is by the utilization of what is called sulfur dioxide removal equipment, in the industry is commonly known as scrubbers and perhaps that is what we actually refer to it from time to time.","start":337.746,"stop":355.929,"duration":18.18},{"text":"The other method would be the use of a low sulfur content coal.","start":355.929,"stop":365.429,"duration":9.5},{"text":"It is ordinarily found in the Midwest and it is not too frequent these days.","start":365.429,"stop":375.041,"duration":9.61},{"text":"We allege in our petition that in the time following the period 30 days after the administrator approved the EPA plan, I mean, the administrator of the EPA approve the implementation plan, thereby making it federal law that it has been demonstrated that no scrubbers have been developed or invented that would permit or enable a compliance with this sulfur emission regulation.","start":375.041,"stop":418.579,"duration":43.54},{"text":"So we demonstrate that it is technically impossible to comply with this federal law and we allege that those grounds have a reason more than 30 days following the EPA approval.","start":418.579,"stop":434.725,"duration":16.15},{"text":"Now, it is true that a considerable number of years ago, utilities and suppliers began to work on what are called scrubbers, development, invent them, Union Electric was deeply engaged in this project.","start":434.725,"stop":454.591,"duration":19.87},{"text":"There were high hopes, high expectations, but unhappily in light and in this case, the expectations have not been realized and this (Inaudible) in our complaint, one that we think that is susceptible of proof and I think should be taken by this Court in these deliberations as being a fact.","start":454.591,"stop":482.977,"duration":28.39},{"text":"Now, going to low sulfur coal I think even and I am not saying this in any derogatory manner, but my brethren of the Department of Justice, the respondent EPA would agree that there is unhappily is just not enough low sulfur coal at this time.","start":482.977,"stop":505.832,"duration":22.86},{"text":"And if we go on to the market and corner it, beat it up, up, up, we are going to run into electric rates.","start":505.832,"stop":515.482,"duration":9.65},{"text":"Money has to come from somewhere and it comes from the consumers.","start":515.482,"stop":522.008,"duration":6.53},{"text":"So we are going to have electric rate so high, that we corner the market on low sulfur coal that it would topple, virtually destroy the economy on the St. Louis area, much of Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa.","start":522.008,"stop":539.859,"duration":17.85},{"text":"So we contend that it would be manifestly against the public interest for us to attempt if we could to corner the market.","start":539.859,"stop":549.577,"duration":9.72},{"text":"Now, turning a minute to scrubbers if I may, I am sure all of Your Honors are familiar with the fact, there has been a series of inflation in the world today, unhappily the price of these ineffective scrubbers, these inefficient scrubbers that will not enable us to comply have increased so enormously that to install them on our three electric generating plants would cost us over $500 million.","start":549.577,"stop":588.511,"duration":38.93},{"text":"Assuming that we can go on to the market in New York and ask and get $500 million for non-productive equipment, we have terrible carrying charges as we allege, it is worth hundred million dollars per year, that would call for terrible increase on electric rates.","start":588.511,"stop":609.113,"duration":20.6},{"text":"We do not allege the percentage, but it would be so high that we say it would be manifestly against the public interest and again it would be imposing upon our economy and economic condition there would be manifestly against the public interest.","start":609.113,"stop":628.641,"duration":19.53},{"text":"I think there is one variant part of allegation in our complaint that has to be realized and considered in this entire case and that is our allegation that although Union Electric, the petitioner is not meeting the state sulfur emission standard in the federally approved implementation plan, it is fulfilling the national ambient air quality standards, both primarily and secondary and these national ambient air quality standards are really thrust the purpose of our Clean Air Act.","start":628.641,"stop":683.832,"duration":55.19},{"text":"I suppose that when you get down to precise question as you have to at some time or should in any lawsuit, perhaps make an existence precisely as possible to do, what do we mean by the word “grounds” in the judicial review section?","start":683.832,"stop":704.137,"duration":20.3},{"text":"Well it is a word of general import; lawyers use it all the time.","start":704.137,"stop":713.378,"duration":9.24},{"text":"Judges use it.","start":713.378,"stop":715.028,"duration":1.65},{"text":"I do not know if whether we always know exactly what we mean by it, but here I do not think we can take that word alone.","start":715.028,"stop":722.704,"duration":7.68},{"text":"We have to look at to congressional history.","start":722.704,"stop":726.359,"duration":3.66},{"text":"We have a somewhat ambiguous statute here.","start":726.359,"stop":729.551,"duration":3.19},{"text":"We have to look at the congressional history and there is one other thing that I want to point out and that is this Court is familiar with the rule that you should construe an Act of Congress to be constitutional or rather than unconstitutional for the reason of the concept.","start":729.551,"stop":749.847,"duration":20.3},{"text":"So sometimes in the constructional process itself, we are confronted with constitutional questions.","start":749.847,"stop":762.099,"duration":12.25},{"text":"Now, let me divert, if I may for just one second, there has been a kind of a thread that is running through this litigation and that is that where really you should not and maybe you do not intend to place a fact-finding original type jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals, for we claim that you have here, but the statute has, the Congressional Act has, maybe that is unfortunate, I suppose it is unfortunate the courts have more than they can do anyway, but it has been done here and the question is, what are the facts to be found?","start":762.099,"stop":821.114,"duration":59.01},{"text":"We say that these technical and economic factors making it impossible for petitioners to comply with the regulation, although we are fulfilling the federal standard.","start":821.114,"stop":840.39,"duration":19.28}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.

Ferrell","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I do in my brief and I will now point out that we think from constitutional point of view, there are three different methods that the constitutional requirement should be met and when you talk about a different type of review in a sense you have to look at the two periods of time.","start":853.593,"stop":880.202,"duration":26.61},{"text":"I hope I am not taking too long to answer your question, but when you have it in the Court of Appeals 30 days after the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has approved the plan then you do have some kind of a record before the Court.","start":880.202,"stop":901.173,"duration":20.97},{"text":"But when you are alleging in your petition in the Court of Appeals grounds that arose long after the Federal Agency has acted, you do not have an administrator or administrative record or review with one possible exception which I refer to in my brief and I think it is a possible one, one that might be adapted by this Court.","start":901.173,"stop":935.669,"duration":34.5},{"text":"Maybe it is the best one, I do not know, we are unhappily dealing with a sort of ambiguous Act of Congress and presented with a very difficult problem, well, you do not want to throw it out completely as being too ambiguous.","start":935.669,"stop":949.323,"duration":13.65}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

Ferrell","textObjs":[{"text":"They did say that.","start":957.082,"stop":958.841,"duration":1.76},{"text":"They did say that and I have been anticipating whether there would be a question as to whether the time period really makes a difference.","start":958.841,"stop":969.966,"duration":11.13},{"text":"Procedurally, I think it probably might.","start":969.966,"stop":974.573,"duration":4.61},{"text":"In my initial brief, I skirted around it, in my reply brief and the adversary have sometimes, I have got a little more definitely to it, but I am not at all assured.","start":974.573,"stop":988.114,"duration":13.54},{"text":"I mean, I am rather inclined to think that technical and economic factors must be considered at any time.","start":988.114,"stop":1000.635,"duration":12.52}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
