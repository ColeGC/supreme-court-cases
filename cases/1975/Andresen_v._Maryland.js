scene, involved in the search and its fruits which are complained of in this petition.","start":66.624,"stop":84.838,"duration":18.21},{"text":"There existed between petitioner and a local bank, a dispute as to application of payments, which were forwarded, to the bank to extinguish a particular lien, which encompass several properties in a subdivision in Montgomery County.","start":84.838,"stop":107.026,"duration":22.19},{"text":"It was the basis of this dispute that provided the hearsay evidence and information upon which the affidavits of the police officers were based which was used to obtain the search warrant to search the petitioner’s offices.","start":107.026,"stop":129.728,"duration":22.7},{"text":"The dispute arose because the indebted party for whose benefit the payments were being forwarded to the bank was the credit -- was the debtor on two separate debts, one of which was a lien debt, the other which was a personal debt.","start":129.728,"stop":151.677,"duration":21.95},{"text":"And although the checks in their accompanying letters and releases which were mailed to the bank in each instance were forwarded by messenger, stipulated that the money was to be applied to a particular debt.","start":151.677,"stop":164.305,"duration":12.63},{"text":"The bank instead was applying the money to the personal rather than the secured debt and this came to light later in a civil case involving the same subject matter, in which it was held that the bank was erroneously doing so and in fact the lien complained of had been extinguished some months prior to the acts complained of which lead to the search.","start":164.305,"stop":188.896,"duration":24.59},{"text":"However, this was a scene upon which the information was related to the investigators who swore to the affidavit contained in the warrant upon which the Circuit Court Judge issued and found probable cause and issued the search warrant.","start":188.896,"stop":209.065,"duration":20.17},{"text":"Now the warrants, there were two in number, called for the search of petitioner’s law offices and also another office which was occupied jointly by petitioner for storage of his files and with some corporate offices of which the involvement is not completely clear, but the petitioner did have some involvement.","start":209.065,"stop":237.623,"duration":28.56},{"text":"There were two separate warrants based upon the same affidavits.","start":237.623,"stop":244.942,"duration":7.32},{"text":"The majority of the affidavits were the same.","start":244.942,"stop":247.636,"duration":2.69},{"text":"I think one of the affidavits had some additional information and that was the search of the corporate offices, it had some additional information to establish that petitioner’s legal files were maintained in storage and that some of his employees did work in part of that office.","start":247.636,"stop":268.892,"duration":21.26},{"text":"Now, the law office itself, picture if you will, a reception room with a secretary and other chairs and one desk, a large office type

their contents.","start":268.892,"stop":303.76,"duration":34.87},{"text":"Piles of papers on each of this desk, a conference room and two lawyer’s offices of which there were book cases containing

drawer.","start":322.797,"stop":329.011,"duration":6.21},{"text":"The auxiliary office was containing even more files and title files, was occupied in part by petitioner and his law clerk and used for reference to these files when preparing title abstracts information because petitioner was a Title Attorney and heavily engaged in not only real property practice, but handling transfers of real estate in Montgomery County.","start":329.011,"stop":359.978,"duration":30.97},{"text":"Petitioner had handled at the time of the search, according to his files, over 5,000 property cases since he

transfers were dependent on prior transfers, and therefore, the files were not so voluminous.","start":376.05,"stop":384.776,"duration":8.73},{"text":"But the files comprised so much space that even though petitioner's office was a 1,200 to 1,400 foot category and in a neighborhood of five to seven employees beside himself in it, that he had to have additional space in order to store the balance of the records.","start":384.776,"stop":406.8,"duration":22.02},{"text":"That is the scene upon which the officers entered with the warrant.","start":406.8,"stop":414.338,"duration":7.54},{"text":"The affidavit contained in the warrants, contains mostly interviews with individuals and the results of these interviews.","start":414.338,"stop":436.587,"duration":22.25},{"text":"And in part two of the petition, petitioner complains that because there were no direct observation or personal knowledge as to the things sought in the affidavits that it was necessary for the affidavits to spell out reasons why the hearsay evidence was reliable.","start":436.587,"stop":464.147,"duration":27.56},{"text":"We maintain that there was no such information contained in the affidavit.","start":464.147,"stop":472.562,"duration":8.42},{"text":"That the information was sought and obtained from individuals who were involved with the petitioner in the dispute which I earlier
