people.","start":242.814,"stop":257.548,"duration":14.73},{"text":"Our position of course is that the 1926 statute created no vested rights in that future distribution and that Congress retained inherent continuing power to amend that aspect of the Allotment Act.","start":257.548,"stop":272.738,"duration":15.19},{"text":"Looking particularly to the four constituent elements of the legislative and administrative process giving rise and surrounding this enactment, one finds, I think complete support for our position that no property right was presently transferred at that time.","start":272.738,"stop":287.823,"duration":15.08},{"text":"Firstly, the circumstances giving rise to the enactment shows that the Federal Allotment Policy itself commenced more or less in the end of the 1870s was formalized in 1887 with the enactment of the General Allotment Act and the basic theory was that the solution to the Indian problem would be to divide up tribal ownership into individual ownership.","start":287.823,"stop":308.047,"duration":20.22},{"text":"And pursuant to that policy individualized allotment acts were enacted for a host of reservations.","start":308.047,"stop":313.143,"duration":5.1},{"text":"The brother reservations of the Northern Cheyenne reservation, the State of Montana received Allotment Act very early under that policy, the Fort Belknap Reservation in 1888, the Flathead Reservation in 1904, The Crow Reservation in 1904, the Blackfeet Reservation in 1907 and the Fort Peck Reservation in 1908.","start":313.143,"stop":332.23,"duration":19.09},{"text":"Yet by 1926 the Northern Cheyenne Reservation was not yet allotted in any sense and had received no allotment statute.","start":332.23,"stop":340.088,"duration":7.86},{"text":"The reasons for this arose from two factors, one, the view of the administrator charged with the responsibility for administering Indian affairs, the Secretary of the Interior, that the Northern Cheyenne people themselves and the Northern Cheyenne Reservation physically was not be suitable for allotment.","start":340.088,"stop":357.011,"duration":16.92},{"text":"The other factor was that by the early 1920s, a severe reassessment of the allotment policy was underway and in fact there was substantial public and official skepticism about the utility of the allotment policy.","start":357.011,"stop":371.033,"duration":14.02},{"text":"In particular, the Department of Interior felt that the Northern Cheyenne people were backward or have a long history of resistance to the white civilization and were not suitable for the “Civilizing Benefits” of allotment.","start":371.033,"stop":384.932,"duration":13.9},{"text":"Moreover the Department felt that the Reservation itself was not physically suitable for allotment because it was a grazing reservation and the allotment theory was really a farming theory.","start":384.932,"stop":395.3,"duration":10.37},{"text":"So there was substantial official resistance to allotting the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.","start":395.3,"stop":400.481,"duration":5.18},{"text":"This coupled with the emergence in the 1920s of the critical reassessment of the Allotment Policy made for offer great resistance within the government to allotting the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.","start":400.481,"stop":410.187,"duration":9.71},{"text":"In fact, the 1926 Allotment Act that was enacted for the Northern Cheyennes was the last original allotment act ever enacted by Congress.","start":410.187,"stop":419.851,"duration":9.66},{"text":"Moreover, these circumstances gave rise to unique allotment act, an act far more limited than any other allotment act which Congress had ever enacted.","start":419.851,"stop":429.318,"duration":9.47},{"text":"The typical pattern for an allotment act in all of these other Montana reservations and the Osage Reservations and throughout the country was basically a substantial distribution of the entire corpus of tribal property.","start":429.318,"stop":440.451,"duration":11.13},{"text":"Provisions were made for ailing ability of distributive property and as a result I might add -- and this is one of the reasons for the official reassessment of the allotment policy, 90 million acres of Indian lands were lost from Indian ownership and in fact today in the State of Montana if one looks around one will find that these allotted reservations are substantially either in white ownership on in white use.","start":440.451,"stop":459.692,"duration":19.24},{"text":"However, the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, because of the unique allotment act, is in 98% Indian ownership, is in 99% Indian use, 85% of the population of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation is Northern Cheyenne and this is directly traceable to the unique and limited nature of that allotment act.","start":459.692,"stop":477.057,"duration":17.37},{"text":"In any event, the Northern Cheyennes wanted, they were concerned that their reservation rested only on an executive order and that they therefore, the tribe as a whole therefore, did not have a vested confirmed property interest in that reservation.","start":477.057,"stop":490.644,"duration":13.59},{"text":"So they wanted a congressional enactment which would confirm tribal ownership of that executive order reservation. Secondly, they wanted limited allotments, so that they have a plot of land on which they could build homes.","start":490.644,"stop":501.645,"duration":11},{"text":"Those were the two central functions of the Allotment Act.","start":501.645,"stop":505.051,"duration":3.41},{"text":"The third function was to make sure that the natural resources of that reservation remained in tribal ownership, to be developed for the benefit of all the people.","start":505.051,"stop":513.397,"duration":8.35},{"text":"The allotment plan itself, the allotment statute announced what I maintain as a plan, a statutory plan to transfer the mineral interest under allotted lands at the end of 50 years on the theory that the 50 year period would be adequate for development of that mineral resource.","start":513.397,"stop":529.624,"duration":16.23},{"text":"It turned out because of external facts that the mineral wealth of the Reservation was not developable within that 50 year period and in 1968 Congress amended the act to implement the central intent of the 1926 Congress that the mineral wealth of the reservation inure to the benefit of all the people.","start":529.624,"stop":547.442,"duration":17.82},{"text":"In any event, in February of 1925, the people themselves submitted a petition to Congress requesting the enactment of the Allotment Act.","start":547.442,"stop":555.671,"duration":8.23},{"text":"The petition was submitted to their senator, Senator Thomas Walsh and the petition was very short, it is at Page 56 of the Appendix.","start":555.671,"stop":563.841,"duration":8.17},{"text":"It was signed by 490 members of the Tribe which according to my conservative calculation was 58% of the adult membership of the Tribe at that time.","start":563.841,"stop":573.832,"duration":9.99},{"text":"The cover letter that submitted this petition indicated that absolutely no opposition had been received, had been indicated on the Reservation to the concept of this petition and the petition is very short, in three paragraphs.","start":573.832,"stop":587.071,"duration":13.24},{"text":"The first paragraph says that the people want an allotment of tillable farm land.","start":587.071,"stop":591.776,"duration":4.7},{"text":"The second paragraph which is crucial to the resolution of this case says that these people want the following “To reserve all mineral, timber and coal lands for the benefit of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Tribe said tribe to have absolute control of same.”","start":591.776,"stop":608.889,"duration":17.11},{"text":"That event and that petition is what kicked off the legislative process for the formulation of an act which I submit, petitioners submit, conforms to this expressed desires and expectations of the people on the reservations.","start":608.889,"stop":621.07,"duration":12.18}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chestnut if you were representing the other side and wanted to be sure that they had a vested interest, would you have drawn the statute any

differently?","start":632.146,"stop":636.751,"duration":4.61}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Chestnut","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think that what Congress did in the statute was in two places in unprecedented fashion, make very broad reservations of power over the entire allotment plan and the statute.","start":636.751,"stop":651.826,"duration":15.08},{"text":"Other allotment acts like the Crow Allotment Act and these other Montana Allotment Act and the Osage Allotment Act which basically were massive assault on the tribal system, had very specific reservations of power.","start":651.826,"stop":663.26,"duration":11.43},{"text":"And I think the question maybe directed to an argument advanced by respondents that the Northern Cheyenne did not have a specific reservation of power.","start":663.26,"stop":670.956,"duration":7.7},{"text":"The Northern Cheyenne had an overall or encompassing reservation of power which I submit was in complete conformity with the central intent of Congress which was that we are relinquishing trust responsibility, we are not taking part of this reservation apart, we are maintaining the Federal control and we are doing a very little limited thing.","start":670.956,"stop":690.658,"duration":19.7},{"text":"Now with high insight, it might have been good to enumerate every aspect, the federal control that was being retained but on the other hand, I think those things are hard to do.","start":690.658,"stop":701.685,"duration":11.03},{"text":"So I guess
