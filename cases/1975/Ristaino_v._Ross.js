judge in Ham, refused to pose the questions requested.","start":409.9,"stop":415.872,"duration":5.97},{"text":"And nor did he give any instructions as to the meaning of the general question, as to bias or prejudice.","start":415.872,"stop":422.84,"duration":6.97},{"text":"Now the majority opinion in Ham utilized very specific language, this court held in this case under the facts shown by this record, due process of the Fourteenth Amendment required that the defendant be permitted to have the jurors interrogated on the issue of racial bias.","start":422.84,"stop":439.907,"duration":17.07},{"text":"Petitioners suggest that this language is not to be dismissed as mere common judicial locutions, as did the federal district court.","start":439.907,"stop":447.156,"duration":7.25},{"text":"But this Court meant what exactly what it said, that the Court traditionally uses such words of limitation when they are rendering a decision which is required by the particular fact pattern presented to them, when they are rendering a decision solely within the confines of the Due Process clause, fundamental fairness.","start":447.156,"stop":464.983,"duration":17.83},{"text":"We would suggest that this court neither held nor suggested that the constitution conferred a right in every case to have this specific question address the possible racial prejudice put to perspective jurors We further suggest that by basing its decision on the Fourteenth Amendment, rather than the Six Amendment right to an impartial jury as urged by petitioner Ham in his petition for certiorari and in the brief to this court.","start":464.983,"stop":490.547,"duration":25.56},{"text":"That the Court indicated its intention to limit its decision to cases involving special circumstances, as did the case in Ham.","start":490.547,"stop":501.019,"duration":10.47},{"text":"Finally, we would suggest that this Court’s action on Ross’ initial petition for writ of certiorari indicates that its rule in Ham was in fact limited to a particular fact pattern, and that no new per se constitutional rule was there in announced.","start":501.019,"stop":516.676,"duration":15.66},{"text":"For this court vacated the Ross decision and remanded, it did not reverse outright, and we would suggest that the vacation was made so that the Supreme Judicial Court could reconsider the fact pattern in Ross within light of Ham.","start":516.676,"stop":536.572,"duration":19.9},{"text":"Petitioners therefore suggest that the scope of the Ham decision is limited to those cases involving circumstances with the probability of prejudice.","start":536.572,"stop":543.761,"duration":7.19},{"text":"It is not sufficient to mention to require a deviation from the normal voir dire procedure, which is traditionally left within the digression of the trial judge.","start":543.761,"stop":552.851,"duration":9.09},{"text":"We would

of the discussion between counsel and the trial judge as to whether this questions would be asked.","start":560.853,"stop":567.129,"duration":6.28},{"text":"The trial judge asked the counsel for a co-defendant whether there was anything peculiar to the circumstances of this case.","start":567.129,"stop":574.468,"duration":7.34},{"text":"The response was no, just as the victim is white and the defendants are black.","start":574.468,"stop":578.716,"duration":4.25},{"text":"Counsel for Ross brought no peculiar or special circumstances with the attention of the trial judge.","start":578.716,"stop":585.661,"duration":6.94},{"text":"Further, the trial judge indicated he would give preliminary instructions on the meaning of the first question to be asked by the clerk.","start":585.661,"stop":593.654,"duration":7.99},{"text":"In substance then instruction was that each of the jurors must remember they were under oath, that they had an absolute duty to render a fair and impartial verdict based upon the evidence heard in the courtroom, not on any extraneous factors, no bias, or prejudice of any kind.","start":593.654,"stop":612.485,"duration":18.83},{"text":"That the clerk in asking the first question would be given an opportunity to inform the court if you cannot or if you serious doubt

hand.","start":631.201,"stop":636.226,"duration":5.02},{"text":"The defendants were then asked to stand, so clearly the jurors were aware that they were in fact black.","start":636.226,"stop":644.369,"duration":8.14},{"text":"In fact, a number of jurors did raise their hands and indicate their inability to render a fair and impartial jury.","start":644.369,"stop":650.99,"duration":6.62},{"text":"One for admitted racial prejudice, two for general prejudice, seven for previously formed opinion, seven because their relationship with
