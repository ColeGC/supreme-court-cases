Unchanged in particular are certain fundamental observations that were made by this Court in its decision in Roe versus Wade.","start":52.8,"stop":67.694,"duration":14.89},{"text":"This includes one; the fact of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy and the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires, noted by the Court at page 116.","start":67.694,"stop":81.486,"duration":13.79},{"text":"Secondly, was the support of the Court’s position by broadly based and concerned organizations, which included and still include today things such as the American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist, the American Public Health Association and the American Bar Association, also noted in the Court’s opinion, at pages 144 to 146.","start":81.486,"stop":105.246,"duration":23.76},{"text":"And thirdly, was the relative safety of abortion, when compared to the mortality risk normally associated with child birth, noted by the Court at page 149.","start":105.246,"stop":115.636,"duration":10.39},{"text":"And lastly, was the observation that those trained in the respective disciplines of Medicine, Philosophy and Theology, are unable to arrive at any consensus of a question of when life begins, noted by the Court at page 159.","start":115.636,"stop":131.663,"duration":16.03},{"text":"But I would suggest that even more dramatic are those changes which have been directly wrought by those -- the court’s decision of that day.","start":131.663,"stop":139.628,"duration":7.96},{"text":"The first is that Septic Abortions in the United States have decreased by 50%.","start":139.628,"stop":145.048,"duration":5.42},{"text":"Secondly, Maternal Mortality associated with pregnancy has decreased by 80% in the United States.","start":145.048,"stop":152.474,"duration":7.43},{"text":"And Thirdly, Illegitimate Births have also dramatically decreased.","start":152.474,"stop":158.187,"duration":5.71},{"text":"It is somehow cruelly ironic that that area of medical practice, afforded the greatest constitutional protection by this Court, is the same area of medical practice over which the State of Missouri has seen fit to exercise the greatest legislative control.","start":158.187,"stop":176.024,"duration":17.84},{"text":"In 1971, just five years ago, approximately 38% of the world’s population had access to safe medical and legal abortions.","start":176.024,"stop":185.673,"duration":9.65},{"text":"Only five years later now in 1976, two-thirds of the world’s population enjoys that right.","start":185.673,"stop":193.314,"duration":7.64},{"text":"No democracy has ever reversed the trend of liberalizing abortion once accomplished and yet the District Court’s opinion below has severely throttled and restricted this Court’s opinions of Roe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton and has hampered the medical progress and the reproductive freedom for women, granted by this court in 1973, in which was over a hundred years in coming to pass.","start":193.314,"stop":218.518,"duration":25.2},{"text":"In addition, there is a side effect of restrictive abortions and particularly those in the second trimester and that is that it threatens to cripple all of the advances made in amniocentesis, by which today approximately 60 serious genetic chromosomal disorders can now be diagnosed.","start":218.518,"stop":236.284,"duration":17.77},{"text":"We would also point out that the District Court’s opinion below, is the only Federal Court challenged to uphold major legislation or policy in the area of abortion since January 22nd of 1973.","start":236.284,"stop":248.415,"duration":12.13},{"text":"In all other cases in which policy or legislation was challenged, it was voided as not meeting the requirements of Roe and Doe.","start":248.415,"stop":256.25,"duration":7.84},{"text":"The jurisdiction of this Court is clear under the holdings in Gonzales and M.T.M. This Court in Roe and Doe, and subsequent courts, which have had little difficulty in understanding the opinions rendered by this Court, have set up certain standards and tests by which abortion legislation and abortion policy is to be judged and they include among others; number one, the delineation of the period of gestation in the various periods, frequently called trimesters, but not truly so, at the first trimester and then the second period running up to the point of viability and the period afterwards.","start":256.25,"stop":292.45,"duration":36.2},{"text":"They have

the Eight Circuit pointed out that anytime the states seeks to single out abortion from among the hundreds and thousands of other medical and surgical procedures for special attention, it has imposed

interest test of course, is the fact that any regulations enacted, which conform to those test must be narrowly drawn and we suggest as we will go through each of these sections that are challenged here this morning, that they are not so narrowly drawn.","start":336.267,"stop":351.06,"duration":14.79},{"text":"Again, is a test which is required that abortion be treated equally with childbirth

mortality rates for childbirth.","start":351.06,"stop":371.068,"duration":20.01},{"text":"And lastly as the observation, the effect of any restrictions upon access to abortion are more onerous for the poor and for the young.","start":371.068,"stop":380.295,"duration":9.23},{"text":"It is basically of course very difficult to go into any great detail in any of this sections due to the time that it is allotted, and therefore, we will attempt to only take them in order as they appear in the statute.","start":380.295,"stop":391.871,"duration":11.58},{"text":"First Section that was challenged is Section 2(2), which involves the definition of viability.","start":391.871,"stop":398.24,"duration":6.37},{"text":"The statute provides that viability is defined as follows, “that stage of fetal development, when the life of the unborn child maybe continued indefinitely outside of the womb by natural or artificial life support of systems.”","start":398.24,"stop":412.76,"duration":14.52},{"text":"This section needs to be read of course in conjunction with Section 5, providing the no-abortion not necessary for life or health maybe performed after the period of viability as statutorily defined.","start":412.76,"stop":424.816,"duration":12.06},{"text":"This Court in speaking of viability, spoke about it in several different ways and on three separated occasions.","start":424.816,"stop":431.671,"duration":6.86},{"text":"First on page 160 of the decision in Roe, it referred the viability as usually being placed about seven months, twenty-eight weeks, but may occur earlier even at twenty-four weeks.","start":431.671,"stop":443.807,"duration":12.14},{"text":"Secondly, on page 163, the Court said that point of time in which the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother’s womb and in the third place also on page 160, the Court referred to when the fetus is potentially able to live outside the mother’s womb or be it with artificial aid.","start":443.807,"stop":466.484,"duration":22.68},{"text":"We do not believe as the State contends that the Court may only look to one of these meanings, and thereby incorporate it statutorily into the statute.","start":466.484,"stop":475.842,"duration":9.36},{"text":"We believe that all three must be look like -- look at and taken as a group.","start":475.842,"stop":481.462,"duration":5.62},{"text":"First of all this restriction in definition invades the first trimester.","start":481.462,"stop":486.416,"duration":4.95},{"text":"By the mere addition of the word indefinitely which do not appear in the Supreme Court’s decision, which dictionary is defined as indeterminate, it provides for remote possibility even for seconds of survival, and yet the idea of brief respiratory gasp or fleeting heartbeats are not considered by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as life.","start":486.416,"stop":509.031,"duration":22.62},{"text":"Fleeting heartbeats and respiratory gasps are still considered to qualify as a stillbirth under those definitions.","start":509.031,"stop":517.032,"duration":8},{"text":"Three courts, three Federal Courts have held that in fact this Court’s language as to twenty-eight weeks, but perhaps occurring at twenty-four was not dicta.","start":517.032,"stop":526.612,"duration":9.58},{"text":"That in fact it was to be a lower limit beyond which states could not allow viability to occur under then existing medical evidence before this Court in 1973.","start":526.612,"stop":538.26,"duration":11.65},{"text":"The problem of defining viability involves whether you are talking about a remote possibility of survival as opposed to perhaps a probability.","start":538.26,"stop":546.855,"duration":8.6},{"text":"This was a problem in the now celebrated trial of Dr. Ethan (ph) in Boston.","start":546.855,"stop":551.248,"duration":4.39},{"text":"We would suggest that the standard be as follows; that there be a irrebuttable and conclusive presumption that viability does not occur before twenty-four weeks.","start":551.248,"stop":561.18,"duration":9.93},{"text":"And we agree with the three federal courts that have interpreted the Court's decision as saying that this was not intended to be dicta, but was to be a holding.","start":561.18,"stop":568.741,"duration":7.56},{"text":"And we further believe that in those cases, the fetus being beyond twenty-four weeks in gestation, that the State has a burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that particular fetus in question would have survived and not the possibility.","start":568.741,"stop":584.565,"duration":15.82},{"text":"The fact that one in a thousand at that particular stage of gestation might survive is no answer to the Doctor whose faced of making the decision at the time, as to whether the particular fetus is viable.","start":584.565,"stop":597.768,"duration":13.2},{"text":"We also feel that it is necessary to have some form of absolute lower limit, because in practice it has been shown that the physician of course would tend to err on the side of safety for himself and the legal processes and not necessarily with only the woman’s interest in mind.","start":597.768,"stop":617.961,"duration":20.19},{"text":"Second Section challenged is that Section 3(2) requiring patient's consent.","start":617.961,"stop":625.058,"duration":7.1},{"text":"This makes it a crime to perform an abortion without requiring the woman to certify in writing that her consent is informed and freely given and not the result of coercion.","start":625.058,"stop":634.961,"duration":9.9},{"text":"It applies to all stages of pregnancy, and it singles out abortion from all other medical and surgical
