On March 18, the teachers went on strike.","start":124.575,"stop":135.717,"duration":11.14},{"text":"At that time they were then teaching under one-year individual contracts of employment, pursuant to Wisconsin law.","start":135.717,"stop":143.074,"duration":7.36},{"text":"The strike closed the public school.","start":143.074,"stop":147.248,"duration":4.17},{"text":"During the strike, the District sent each teacher two letters inviting them to return to work and in the second warning that the School Board would not condone the strike.","start":147.248,"stop":158.368,"duration":11.12},{"text":"A few teachers offered to return to work in response to the first letter, but none offered to return in response to the second letter.","start":158.368,"stop":165.643,"duration":7.28},{"text":"When there was no response to the second invitation to return, the School Board decided to consider whether to terminate and replace the teachers.","start":165.643,"stop":174.826,"duration":9.18},{"text":"Pursuant to the apparent requirements of Board of Regents versus Roth, the teachers were given notice and an opportunity to be heard respecting the action under consideration.","start":174.826,"stop":189.077,"duration":14.25},{"text":"At the hearing, which was scheduled pursuant to those notices before the School Board, the teachers appeared as a group represented by a counsel and took the position that they would not speak individually and would not answer questions.","start":189.077,"stop":202.26,"duration":13.18},{"text":"Counsel on their behalf took the following positions.","start":202.26,"stop":205.422,"duration":3.16},{"text":"First that the School Board could infer they were in fact on strike.","start":205.422,"stop":209.734,"duration":4.31},{"text":"Second, that because the School Board was involved in the bargaining over which they were striking, the School Board could not act in the matter and could not infer that the strike was a breach of contract or unlawful.","start":209.734,"stop":221.734,"duration":12},{"text":"And third, counsel for the teachers asserted that the School Board had in the past not bargained in good faith as required by Wisconsin law.","start":221.734,"stop":230.754,"duration":9.02},{"text":"The counsel for the School Board reminded counsel for the teachers at that point that the correct forum under Wisconsin law for any allegation of an employer-prohibited practice was the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission and informed counsel for the teachers that in his view, whether or not the School Board was alleged to have refused to bargain, was immaterial to the question of a strike, because under Wisconsin law there is no concept of a prohibited practice or justified strike and because in any event jurisdiction of those matters lay with the WERC.","start":230.754,"stop":264.041,"duration":33.29},{"text":"The WERC is an Agency similar to the National Labor Relations Board, which may decide and may annul any discharge which it’s found -- it finds to have been based in whole or in any part in an anti-union motivation.","start":264.041,"stop":278.426,"duration":14.38},{"text":"The counsel for the teachers in effect agreed that any remedy of an alleged prohibited practice would not terminate the strike, and that the teachers would return to work when a contract acceptable to them had been agreed upon.","start":278.426,"stop":292.312,"duration":13.89},{"text":"He did this by stating that it would do him no good to go before the WERC with an allegation of a prohibited practice.","start":292.312,"stop":300.354,"duration":8.04},{"text":"The teachers have in fact never filed any prohibited practice complaint against the School Board over any aspects of these matters, or never filed any such complaint at all, ever.","start":300.354,"stop":313.206,"duration":12.85},{"text":"Positions which were not taken by the teachers at the hearing were -- there was no attempt to prove or proof that there was any personal bias toward any individual teacher by any member of the School Board.","start":313.206,"stop":324.555,"duration":11.35},{"text":"Their position was an institutional incompatibility.","start":324.555,"stop":328.311,"duration":3.76},{"text":"Second, there was no offer to return to work made by the teachers at that hearing or any indication of an offer other than that in effect, the strike would continue until agreement satisfactory to teachers was reached.","start":328.311,"stop":341.219,"duration":12.91},{"text":"After the hearings, the School Board met and voted to terminate and replace the teachers.","start":341.219,"stop":346.66,"duration":5.44},{"text":"As a part of the same decisions, the School Board determined to invite each teacher to apply for reemployment, and each notice, a written notice of termination to each teacher in fact did contain what the Wisconsin Court described as a notice of a right to apply for reinstatement.","start":346.66,"stop":363.185,"duration":16.52},{"text":"Only one teacher did so apply and he was returned to his former position.","start":363.185,"stop":369.454,"duration":6.27},{"text":"On April 8, 1974, the schools reopened with contractive replacements.","start":369.454,"stop":375.422,"duration":5.97},{"text":"This action was begun alleging a denial of Due Process and in connection with beginning the action, the teachers asked a Wisconsin Circuit Court to enjoin the School Board from hiring permanent replacements, but did not in connection with that motion make an offer to return to work.","start":375.422,"stop":393.555,"duration":18.13},{"text":"After an evidentiary hearing, the Wisconsin Court denied the injunction against hiring replacements, and he noted in his opinion doing so that the teachers were still on strike and consequently depriving themselves of employment on April 11, 1974, some nine days after the terminations and four days after the school opened with contracted replacements.","start":393.555,"stop":416.721,"duration":23.17},{"text":"With respect to the underlying complaint, the School Board moved for summary judgment and in connection of that motion each party had the opportunity to and did make a record to show facts, which they thought were material and in dispute.","start":416.721,"stop":431.692,"duration":14.97},{"text":"The significance here is that the teachers again made no claim of or facts to show any personal bias on the part of any member of the School Board toward any individual teacher.","start":431.692,"stop":442.349,"duration":10.66},{"text":"Again, the focus was an institutional incompatibility, and again, with respect to this motion in June of 1974, the teachers made no effort to claim that there had been any offer to return to work.","start":442.349,"stop":456.2,"duration":13.85},{"text":"The later point is significant because in briefs before this Court, respondent’s now claim that they could prove that there was an offer made in April of ’74, however, the incident referred to was not an unconditional offer and was conditional and was in fact made on April 25, some eighteen days after the School Board had contracted and begun operating with contracted replacements.","start":456.2,"stop":479.644,"duration":23.44},{"text":"The Circuit Court granted the Board’s motion for summary judgment in the teachers' appeal.","start":479.644,"stop":484.659,"duration":5.01},{"text":"The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that under state law, a School Board could discharge these teachers who engaged in the prohibited strike, and the Court rejected the claim that prohibiting this strike was a denial of equal protection.","start":484.659,"stop":499.801,"duration":15.14},{"text":"However, the Wisconsin Court held that the teachers have been denied procedural Due Process.","start":499.801,"stop":505.09,"duration":5.29},{"text":"In Wisconsin Court’s view, under Morrissey versus Brewer, even in a case of a stipulated or undisputed facts, an involved decision maker had to decide what to do on the basis of those facts.","start":505.09,"stop":518.15,"duration":13.06},{"text":"The Wisconsin Court also did not make any finding of a personal bias.","start":518.15,"stop":522.183,"duration":4.03},{"text":"Rather it said that it was not suggesting that School Board members were anything other than dedicated public servants striving to preside -- provide their district with quality education within their limited budget.","start":522.183,"stop":535.415,"duration":13.23},{"text":"The Wisconsin Court made it clear that that defect it saw was an institutional perspective.","start":535.415,"stop":540.974,"duration":5.56},{"text":"It did so by analyzing the methods of review available to the teachers.","start":540.974,"stop":545.712,"duration":4.74},{"text":"It noted that under common law certiorari or by complaint to the Employment Relations Commission, any substantive violation of law was curable, and review it to determine whether or not the decision was arbitrary.","start":545.712,"stop":559.211,"duration":13.5},{"text":"But the Court said neither of these methods could replace an impartial decision maker in the first instance.","start":559.211,"stop":564.821,"duration":5.61}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"When you say neither of these methods, Mr. Walker, you mentioned the common law of writ of certiorari, then what was the other method?","start":564.821,"stop":572.698,"duration":7.88}]},{"speakerName":"Jack D. Walker","textObjs":[{"text":"The other method, Justice Rehnquist, described by the Wisconsin Supreme Court is by complaint to the Employment Relations Commission, and in its discussion of that relief the Court noted specifically that the Employment Relations Commission would overturn any discharge which was based on an anti-union motive, even if there was also a good reason for discharge.","start":572.698,"stop":591.627,"duration":18.93}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

One under Wisconsin law, the Employment Relations Commission cannot only hear normal prohibited practices, but may also entertain suits for breach of collective bargaining agreements and the teachers could probably could have sued in Court on that or in Court on the individual contracts, and did not do any of those things.","start":602.603,"stop":624.819,"duration":22.22}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"(Inaudible) I take it is de novo, would not be on a record made before the School Board?","start":624.819,"stop":630.207,"duration":5.39}]},{"speakerName":"Jack D.
