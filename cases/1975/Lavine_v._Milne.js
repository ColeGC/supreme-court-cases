under 131-11, that is the purpose for which you terminated your employment, cannot be produced or at least there is a considerable cloud on a local agent who required the production on the one hand or on the other who made a determination unfavorable to the applicant when the record was silent as to his purpose.","start":372.497,"stop":404.993,"duration":32.5},{"text":"That is the effect of the
