reversed a decision of the District Court for the District of Columbia, dismissing this complaint for injunction and held that the case should be remanded for a hearing at which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue would be required to make a factual submission as to the basis for the tax assessment here involved and in which the respondent taxpayer would be permitted discovery.","start":71.774,"stop":109.873,"duration":38.1},{"text":"The commission has sought rehearing on the basis of this Court’s opinions in Bob Jones University and Americans United, but the Court of Appeals refused to modify its decision and accordingly, we sought and obtained certiorari.","start":109.873,"stop":124.423,"duration":14.55},{"text":"The controversy arises in the following circumstances.","start":124.423,"stop":129.151,"duration":4.73},{"text":"Mr. Shapiro is a citizen of Israel who came to the United States in 1970.","start":129.151,"stop":136.458,"duration":7.31},{"text":"At some time in that year or shortly thereafter, he was indicted in Israel for security fraud and the government of Israel requested the government of the United States to permit his extradition.","start":136.458,"stop":151.208,"duration":14.75},{"text":"The question of his extradition was litigated in the District Court for the Southern District of New York and in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.","start":151.208,"stop":159.836,"duration":8.63},{"text":"Both courts held that Mr. Shapiro was extraditable and ordered his surrender.","start":159.836,"stop":166.334,"duration":6.5},{"text":"He then filed a petition for certiorari with this Court.","start":166.334,"stop":170.559,"duration":4.22},{"text":"While that petition was pending, Mr. Shapiro negotiated an agreement with the State of Israel under which he would withdraw his petition and would surrender for extradition, if the State of Israel would allow him to remain here until his then unborn child was born and we would allow him to remain on bail until his trial in Israel.","start":170.559,"stop":195.979,"duration":25.42},{"text":"The petition for certiorari in this Court from that extradition was then withdrawn and Mr. Shapiro was scheduled to surrender for extradition on December 9th 1973.","start":195.979,"stop":208.773,"duration":12.79},{"text":"On December 6 of that year, three days earlier, the commissioner, upon learning from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that this extradition was to take place, and pursuing an investigation which had begun in September ’73, issued a jeopardy assessment against Mr. Shapiro for income taxes amounting to approximately $7,000.00 for the year 1970 and $85,000.00 for the year 1971 and levied on some bank accounts maintained by Mr. Shapiro which represented some, but not all of his property.","start":208.773,"stop":249.993,"duration":41.22},{"text":"This of course was a recognition of the fact that had Mr. Shapiro been allowed to depart, the bank accounts would have also departed and there would have been no funds available to the United States to collect taxes which it believed to be due.","start":249.993,"stop":263.574,"duration":13.58},{"text":"At this point, I think it is appropriate to point out the procedure for these assessments.","start":263.574,"stop":268.783,"duration":5.21},{"text":"Normally, in income tax cases, the commissioner, if he determines a deficiency is due from a taxpayer, must under the code issue a statutory notice of deficiency, which provides that within 90 days thereafter, the tax payer may file a petition for review in the tax court of the United States.","start":268.783,"stop":293.452,"duration":24.67},{"text":"This is the procedure described in Section 6212 and 6213 of the Internal Revenue Code which appear in the appendix to our brief.","start":293.452,"stop":303.087,"duration":9.63},{"text":"If he does not follow that procedure, that statute expressly provides that he may be enjoined.","start":303.087,"stop":309.195,"duration":6.11},{"text":"But, Section 6213 contains an express exception, namely for a jeopardy assessment under Section 6861.","start":309.195,"stop":318.889,"duration":9.69},{"text":"That section provides that if the commissioner believes that the assessment or collection of a deficiency may be in jeopardy, he shall, not withstanding the provisions of Section 6213, immediately assess such deficiency.","start":318.889,"stop":336.391,"duration":17.5},{"text":"If he does this before a notice of deficiency has been issued, the statute further provides that he must issue a notice of deficiency within 60 days of that assessment.","start":336.391,"stop":348.379,"duration":11.99},{"text":"Thus, in jeopardy assessments, the procedure is essentially reversed.","start":348.379,"stop":352.387,"duration":4.01},{"text":"The assessment comes first and the notice of deficiency comes
