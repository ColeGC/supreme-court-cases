Shipley, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.","start":52.49,"stop":56.159,"duration":3.67},{"text":"This case was originally brought by the respondent, the plaintiff below, who was a member of the Tennessee National Guard.","start":56.159,"stop":64.971,"duration":8.81},{"text":"He also served in a dual capacity, a separate and distinct capacity, as a National Guard Technician which is a Federal Civil Service capacity exempt from the normal merit competitive Civil Service because of the requirement that these civil servants must maintain their membership in the Tennessee National Guard.","start":64.971,"stop":91.631,"duration":26.66},{"text":"Now, the plaintiff alleged that he was wrongfully denied his opportunity to re-enlist in the Tennessee National Guard, the Air National Guard, asserting that the only reason he was not allowed to reenlist was a sham to deny him his opportunity for continued employment as a technician, as a National Guard Technician under 32 USC Section 709 which creates the National Guard Technician positions.","start":91.631,"stop":123.5,"duration":31.87},{"text":"The complaint argued that in this case, the Military Commander’s discretion in determining whether or not to accept and offer of reenlistment was so broad and vague and it lacked objective criteria and was thus unconstitutional.","start":123.5,"stop":142.29,"duration":18.79},{"text":"Apparently, a delegation of authority argument rather than a Fourteenth Amendment vagueness argument, the denial of the opportunity then to reenlist denied the plaintiff, according to the complaint, his administrative review which he would have had, had he been dismissed for cause from his National Guard Technician status.","start":142.29,"stop":168.305,"duration":26.02},{"text":"The complaint was dismissed by the District Court alluding to the unique relationship between the State Militia and one of its members and holding that the judiciary should avoid interference with legitimate military matters.","start":168.305,"stop":186.549,"duration":18.24},{"text":"The Sixth Circuit from which this -- to which certiorari was granted, reversed and remanded the case directing the District Court to determine a threshold question.","start":186.549,"stop":199.801,"duration":13.25},{"text":"Here, whether or not this military decision not to reenlist this man, was made for a military reason indicating that you look to the military and it is of the decision rather than to the fact that the decision maker was a military man.","start":199.801,"stop":221.666,"duration":21.87},{"text":"The National Guard Technician’s Act of 1968 was passed in order to create a Federal Civil Service Position for National Guard Technicians.","start":221.666,"stop":233.962,"duration":12.3},{"text":"Prior to that time, they had been -- they were called caretakers and they were considered to be state employees.","start":233.962,"stop":241.505,"duration":7.54},{"text":"Consequently, you had a wide diversion of employment benefit, retirement benefits.","start":241.505,"stop":247.607,"duration":6.1},{"text":"So Congress in 1968 chose to make these persons Federal Civil Service employees.","start":247.607,"stop":256.701,"duration":9.09},{"text":"The top level supervisor of these Federal Civil Service employees with the states is the Adjutant General.","start":256.701,"stop":265.896,"duration":9.19},{"text":"He receives that authority from the Congressional Enactment.","start":265.896,"stop":274.12,"duration":8.22},{"text":"Because of the difficulties which had a reason previously with these caretakers not being military members of the particular units in which they served in a caretaker capacity during their week’s work as opposed to their weekend warrior capacity.","start":274.12,"stop":294.62,"duration":20.5},{"text":"The Congress imposed the basic requirement that a man is to be a National Guardsman in order to hold this Civil Service position.","start":294.62,"stop":307.632,"duration":13.01},{"text":"The Adjutant General, the top level supervisor, is required by the Congressional Enactment to promptly separate from employment, any technician, who fails to maintain his National Guard technician.","start":307.632,"stop":323.842,"duration":16.21},{"text":"Now, of course, a technician might be separated for cause.","start":323.842,"stop":327.897,"duration":4.06},{"text":"He might be fired as it were and were he separated for cause, a right of appeal would exist up to the Adjutant General, who is the Military Commander of the State National Guard.","start":327.897,"stop":343.082,"duration":15.19},{"text":"Now, the Sixth Circuit opinion indicates that because this man is a National Guard technician, he has a particular right to continued membership in the National Guard thus, apparently grafting the cause of requirement for firing a Civil Service technician on to the prerequisite for National Guard membership to be maintained in the first instance.","start":343.082,"stop":371.748,"duration":28.67},{"text":"So, that decision avoided the issue of the required membership in the National Guard.","start":371.748,"stop":380.082,"duration":8.33},{"text":"Now, a military member of the National Guard can lose his National Guard status for variety for a variety of reasons.","start":380.082,"stop":386.469,"duration":6.39},{"text":"He maybe too old to continue to serve in the National Guard, he may have a physical illness or injury which would cause him to be separated from the National Guard.","start":386.469,"stop":396.088,"duration":9.62},{"text":"He may simply failed to reenlist.","start":396.088,"stop":400.201,"duration":4.11},{"text":"So, the loss of Guard membership for any of those reasons results on a consequent virtually automatic loss of the technician employment.","start":400.201,"stop":412.964,"duration":12.76}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.
