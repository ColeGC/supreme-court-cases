conditions.”","start":386.588,"stop":419.153,"duration":32.57},{"text":"Now, I stress the words “subject to the following conditions” because the Chessie's contention here is that the orders the

were, if permitted to become effective, generate additional revenues sufficient to enable the carriers to prevent further deterioration and improved service,” and then it said, “However, if the schedules were permitted to become effective as filed and without conditions designed to promote service improvements, the increases proposed would be unjust and unreasonable and contrary to the
