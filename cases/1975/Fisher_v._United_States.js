Court?s decision three terms ago in Couch against the United States.","start":48.023,"stop":60.915,"duration":12.89},{"text":"Couch involved enforcement of an Internal Revenue summons, seeking to secure a taxpayer?s records in the possession of her accountant.","start":60.915,"stop":75.542,"duration":14.63},{"text":"Here, by contrast, we are concerned in both cases with the accountant?s own records, reflecting his work product in preparing tax returns for the taxpayers.","start":75.542,"stop":91.897,"duration":16.36},{"text":"In each of these cases, the records were in the accountant?s possession when the Internal Revenue Service special agents first indicated to the taxpayers that they wish to investigate their tax returns.","start":91.897,"stop":109.227,"duration":17.33},{"text":"In each instance they have been accountant?s possession for at least several years, and in one case dating back to 1959 and it was in both cases, only after the initial investigative contact between the agents and the taxpayers, that the taxpayers hired the attorneys who now have possession of the records, and the accountants were requested to deliver the records to the taxpayers who then handed them over to their attorneys.","start":109.227,"stop":148.14,"duration":38.91},{"text":"In one instance, within about five minutes and in the other instance in twelve days.","start":148.14,"stop":158.945,"duration":10.81},{"text":"The Internal Revenue summonses were issued shortly thereafter to the accountants and the attorneys requesting the records and the testimony of the accountants about the records.","start":158.945,"stop":174.673,"duration":15.73},{"text":"There are slight differences in the records involved in the summonses in the two cases, but in both instances, they are records from the accountant?s files, working for the taxpayer in helping to prepare his income tax returns and compiling other financial information for him.","start":174.673,"stop":197.807,"duration":23.13},{"text":"Upon refusal of the accountants and the attorneys to comply with the summons, these enforcement proceedings were brought, and in each case, the Fifth Amendment privileged against self-incrimination was asserted on behalf of the taxpayers.","start":197.807,"stop":215.935,"duration":18.13},{"text":"In the Third Circuit case, Fisher, the taxpayers intervened to assert the privileges for themselves.","start":215.935,"stop":223.221,"duration":7.29},{"text":"In the Fifth Circuit case, Kasmir, the taxpayer?s attorneys sought to assert it on their behalf.","start":223.221,"stop":235.212,"duration":11.99},{"text":"Both District Courts found that the records were still owned by the accountants and rejected the claim of Fifth Amendment privilege on the merits, and ordered enforcement of the summons.","start":235.212,"stop":253.362,"duration":18.15},{"text":"The District Court in the Fisher case summarized it findings on page A7 of the appendix to the petition as follows.","start":253.362,"stop":270.03,"duration":16.67},{"text":"The facts in the instant case as presented before this Court, demonstrate that the papers were and are the property of the accountant.","start":270.03,"stop":278.55,"duration":8.52},{"text":"They only left his possession after the taxpayer learned of the investigation.","start":278.55,"stop":283.83,"duration":5.28},{"text":"The transfer of the papers seems to indicate that this was an attempt to thwart to Government?s investigation.","start":283.83,"stop":291.363,"duration":7.53},{"text":"And much the same could of be said of actual situation in Kasmir, where the time span was even shorter between the call of the special agent and the transfer of the papers to the taxpayer and then on to the attorney.","start":291.363,"stop":312.91,"duration":21.55},{"text":"The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit sitting en banc affirmed the enforcement order with one Judge dissenting.","start":312.91,"stop":322.483,"duration":9.57},{"text":"A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the enforcement order in that case, again, with one Judge dissenting.","start":322.483,"stop":335.833,"duration":13.35},{"text":"Our starting point in analyzing the problem here is that these materials sought in the summonses would not be subject to a claim of the privilege against self-incrimination while in the accountant?s possession.","start":335.833,"stop":355.887,"duration":20.05},{"text":"This follows a fortiori from the holding in Couch, which held that even papers belonging to the taxpayer would not be subject to a claim of the privilege while in the non-transitory possession of the accountant, and it also follows from this Court?s opinion in California ers and other cases, holding that there is no privilege against self-incrimination with respect to third party records as production is sought from third persons.","start":355.887,"stop":396.003,"duration":40.12},{"text":"And so the question becomes whether they are transferred to the taxpayer in these circumstances, created a right to resist their production on the ground of the privilege against self-incrimination, where that right otherwise would not have existed and there is a further question, which I think is a less substantial one, of whether the subsequent transfer to the attorney affected the right in any way.","start":396.003,"stop":432.734,"duration":36.73},{"text":"In the only other post Couch case dealing with this question, the transfer was handled the other way and that is in the Beattie case, which we have reproduced with the convenience of the court and the appendix to our reply brief in the Kasmir case.","start":432.734,"stop":455.495,"duration":22.76},{"text":"That is a Second Circuit decision, dealing with an almost identical factual situation, except that there they decided to have the records transferred from the accountant through the attorney to the taxpayer and the taxpayer now has the them in his possession, rather than the other way around, but basically the same issues are involved.","start":455.495,"stop":485.941,"duration":30.45},{"text":"Now, we believe that the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Beattie were correct in rejecting the claim of privilege here, based on really two lines of cases supporting their view.","start":485.941,"stop":509.567,"duration":23.63},{"text":"The first are the cases dealing with what are essentially third party records, in the possession of the claimant of the privilege.","start":509.567,"stop":521.277,"duration":11.71},{"text":"Those cases have in the past involved largely organizational records, such as corporate records, labor union records, partnership records in the most recent case.","start":521.277,"stop":536.358,"duration":15.08},{"text":"The line of authority starts with Wilson against the United States and goes through Wheeler, Grant, White and finally Bellis, a recent decision of the Court, and we have developed those cases in our brief.","start":536.358,"stop":556.409,"duration":20.05},{"text":"In essence, they hold that the privilege against self-incrimination being an intimate and personal right, maybe applied only to one?s own personal papers.","start":556.409,"stop":570.353,"duration":13.94}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

Wallace","textObjs":[{"text":"That is correct, in resisting a subpoena to produce the papers.","start":576.192,"stop":580.68,"duration":4.49},{"text":"Those cases hold that an individual in custody of the papers can invoke the privilege only with respect to his own personal papers, not with respect to other papers whose essential characters, the expression that has been used in the case is ?non-personal,? even though they are rightfully in his possession and in several of these cases even though he has a claim of title to them.","start":580.68,"stop":611.389,"duration":30.71},{"text":"In fact, the Grant case involved a claim of exclusive title by the sole shareholder of a dissolved corporation.","start":611.389,"stop":622.59,"duration":11.2},{"text":"The Bellis case also involved a claim of co-ownership of the records, but because the records were not the personal papers of the individual claimant, it was held that the principle of the Boyd case does not apply.","start":622.59,"stop":640.908,"duration":18.32},{"text":"It seems to us that the result reached by the Third Circuit and the Second Circuit here follows a fortiori from these cases, since here there could not even be a claim of ownership asserted.","start":640.908,"stop":655.28,"duration":14.37},{"text":"In both instances, the District Court found that the papers were still owned by the accountant and the Court of Appeals did not disturb those findings.","start":655.28,"stop":666.319,"duration":11.04},{"text":"There was some evidence to the contrary in one of the cases, but it was properly rejected.","start":666.319,"stop":674.05,"duration":7.73}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
