case is here on petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.","start":67.02,"stop":71.644,"duration":4.62},{"text":"The question it poses as we see it is the following; Whether Wisconsin may, consistent with Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution, outlaw peaceful, concertedly refusals to work optional overtime in support of Worker Collective Bargaining Demands.","start":71.644,"stop":88.983,"duration":17.34},{"text":"A self-help pressure permitted under the balance of power is struck by Congress in the Federal Labor

within the Federal Labor Board’s jurisdiction, terminated its labor agreement with the Union in June of 1971.","start":100.4,"stop":109.901,"duration":9.5},{"text":"At that time, the parties had reached impasse on a number of the company’s demands for changes in the contract.","start":109.901,"stop":115.977,"duration":6.08},{"text":"One of these was insistence, the company’s insistence on increasing basic work day and work week from seven and one-half to eight hours a day and thirty-seven-one-half to forty hours a week where the commensurate reduction in over time pay.","start":115.977,"stop":130.583,"duration":14.61},{"text":"On March 1, 1972, while the parties were still in impasse on this and other issues, the company announced its decision to implement its work schedule demands unilaterally, just as it had previously changed other established working additions some months before.","start":130.583,"stop":145.922,"duration":15.34},{"text":"This time, the Union responded by holding a meeting on March 7 at which the membership voted to seek strike sanction from the International Union and unanimously resolved that no member should work overtime to find his work over seven-and-one-half hours a day or thirty-seven-one-half hours a week.","start":145.922,"stop":165.314,"duration":19.39},{"text":"Though the company continued to schedule overtime work thereafter, the membership resolution was observed by virtually all of the over 600 members over the next four months until the new contract was settled in late July.","start":165.314,"stop":178.677,"duration":13.36},{"text":"Faced with the Union’s counter to it self-help initiative, the company backed off from implementing its work day and work week demands.","start":178.677,"stop":186.798,"duration":8.12},{"text":"The impact of the Union’s overtime moratorium was to cause severe economic hardship to the company and its effort to deal with temporary pulse increases in production loads while the workers lost substantial additional earnings that they would have receive had the overtime been worked.","start":186.798,"stop":204.574,"duration":17.78},{"text":"For the past 17 years, K&T employees, the company’s employees had worked the seven-and-one-half hour work day and thirty-seven

moratorium.","start":215.011,"stop":222.896,"duration":7.88},{"text":"By custom and understanding as the commission found, Respondent Commission, none of these employees had been required to work daily or weekend overtime prior to the March 7 membership meeting.","start":222.896,"stop":235.965,"duration":13.07},{"text":"Admittedly, since acceptance of overtime assignments remained optional thereafter, no employee who concertedly refused to accept scheduled overtime, pursuant to the moratorium was even disciplined.","start":235.965,"stop":249.954,"duration":13.99},{"text":"The union rejected the company proposal to settle the controversy by the company’s differing implementation of the new work schedules, if the Union would agree that all daily overtime would now become part of the regular work schedule and cannot be refused, except for reasons acceptable to supervision.","start":249.954,"stop":269.342,"duration":19.39},{"text":"On June 12, 1972, during the overtime moratorium but the same day that it commenced the present action, the company filed a charge with the NLRB, alleging in part that Union’s overtime moratorium restrained the employees in the exercise

Act.","start":269.342,"stop":294.41,"duration":25.07},{"text":"That charge was dismissed by the Board’s director on the ground that the overtime refusals were not violative of the Federal Statute.","start":294.41,"stop":302.844,"duration":8.43},{"text":"The director cited the 1960 decision of this Court in Insurance Agents International Union where various concerted interference with production on the job action were held permissible under the Act though assumed not to be protected from employer appraisal by Section 7 of the National Act.","start":302.844,"stop":322.316,"duration":19.47},{"text":"In this case, in our case, the director made no determination as to whether K&T employees lost that protection by collectively exercising the right to reject overtime work in the circumstances here.","start":322.316,"stop":334.968,"duration":12.65},{"text":"However, the State Commission in the instant proceeding and later the Supreme Court held that the very same peaceful self-help activity permitted by the Board’s director breached the Wisconsin Labor Relations Statute which prohibits workers from engaging in any concerted effort to interfere with production, except by leaving the premises in an orderly manner for the purpose of going on strike.","start":334.968,"stop":362.487,"duration":27.52},{"text":"The Union’s defense of federal preemption was rejected by the state tribunals on grounds that the conduct was neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited by the Federal Statute and on the authority

regulate.","start":362.487,"stop":388.75,"duration":26.26},{"text":"That states the case.","start":388.75,"stop":390.75,"duration":2},{"text":"On these facts, we desire to emphasize two of the

case.","start":400.406,"stop":406.367,"duration":5.96},{"text":"The second that Briggs-Stratton should be declared overruled or limited to its exact facts and of course the reason supportive of the latter reinforce the former.","start":406.367,"stop":421.163,"duration":14.8},{"text":"The first point; without reaching any issue as to the current survival of any prior decision of this Court, we think state jurisdiction must yield simply because the quality of the conduct here is so different in kind from that which is hereto for ever been held subject to state prohibition in collective bargaining.","start":421.163,"stop":445.666,"duration":24.5},{"text":"Please contrast if --","start":445.666,"stop":447.029,"duration":1.36}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E.
