from?","start":454.983,"stop":467.338,"duration":12.36},{"text":"It seems to me quite logical to establish a foundation for the grand jury’s crediting his testimony to cover the background and show

suppress his grand jury testimony.","start":560.049,"stop":564.444,"duration":4.39},{"text":"He found that respondent had been a putative defendant at the time he was called to appear before the grand

he was entitled to full Miranda Warnings.","start":575.335,"stop":579.344,"duration":4.01},{"text":"Since he did not receive the full warnings the questioning was improper and his answer should be

putative defendant that therefore his interrogation was custodial and he was entitled to full Miranda Warnings.","start":593.573,"stop":601.637,"duration":8.06},{"text":"The opinion of the Court of Appeals reflects what we view as a rather disturbing approach toward the function of the grand jury and one that we think is quite inconsistent with the views expressed on numerous occasions by this court.","start":601.637,"stop":615.846,"duration":14.21},{"text":"While the requirement imposed that simply the giving of Miranda Warnings, the opinion reflects a basic hostility to the practice of calling as a grand jury witness persons who according to information on the government’s possession have some involvement in the activities under investigation.","start":615.846,"stop":632.013,"duration":16.17},{"text":"For instance, if you look at the appendix at page 15(a), the Court says this is toward the top to the certiorari petition that is correct, I am sorry.","start":632.013,"stop":645.005,"duration":12.99},{"text":"In order to deter the prosecuting officers from bringing a putative or virtual defendant before the grand jury for the purpose of obtaining incriminating and perjurious testimony, the accused must be adequately apprised of his rights for all of his testimony incriminating and perjurious will be suppressed and at

conduct.","start":645.005,"stop":672.803,"duration":27.8},{"text":"We conclude that the entire proceeding was a violation of Mandujano’s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.","start":672.803,"stop":678.389,"duration":5.59},{"text":"The same theme is echoed in United States against Wang which is the Ninth Circuit decision in which there is a pending certiorari petition.","start":678.389,"stop":687.165,"duration":8.78},{"text":"Now, ostensibly the Court of Appeals is talking about cases in which a witness is called for the purpose of getting him to incriminate himself or perjury himself but the application of its strong language, the facts of this case reflect how far its holding really goes in practical application.","start":687.165,"stop":708.354,"duration":21.19},{"text":"Now, we submit that the approach of the Court of Appeals strikes at the heart of the effective functioning of the investigator grand jury.","start":708.354,"stop":715.131,"duration":6.78},{"text":"That body is in that capacity attempting to ferried out secret crime.","start":715.131,"stop":720.492,"duration":5.36},{"text":"How can they do this without obtaining the cooperation of those persons who have at least some peripheral involvement in the criminal activity under investigation?","start":720.492,"stop":729.224,"duration":8.73},{"text":"In the San Francisco investigation of Police Corruption, a person such as Rose Wang who was apparently involved in gambling activities and thought to have made payoffs to police, is the very kind of person whose cooperation is absolutely essential to the grand jury.","start":729.224,"stop":746.38,"duration":17.16},{"text":"Here a person like Mandujano who is tied into major heroin dealings in the San Antonio areas, a person whose cooperation is vital to the

these.","start":760.059,"stop":767.661,"duration":7.6},{"text":"We advance in this case what are in effect five independent grounds for reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.","start":767.661,"stop":774.628,"duration":6.97},{"text":"The resolution of anyone of these in our favor and we believe we are clearly correct on all five necessitates a
