case.","start":509.456,"stop":514.585,"duration":5.13},{"text":"But that is not the posture this case is in now and I think as this Court said in Milliken, a controlling principle which is consistently been stated in the holdings of this Court is that the scope of the remedy is determined by the nature and the extent of the violation and as the concurring opinion put it there, the Courts there were in error for the simple reason that they thought what the remedy they thought necessary was simply not commensurate with the constitutional violation found and that is what I think is difficulty here.","start":514.585,"stop":545.558,"duration":30.97},{"text":"I want to discuss Milliken, but I first want to develop a point which is not fully developed in our brief, although it is present and which in and of itself seems to me fully dispositive of this case.","start":545.558,"stop":556.944,"duration":11.39},{"text":"As I said, respondents here proved a violation which was entirely within the City of Chicago and relief was ordered there quite properly and on this last appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeals ordered consideration of metropolitan relief.","start":556.944,"stop":574.104,"duration":17.16},{"text":"Now, it gave a couple of reasons why it thought metropolitan relief was essential.","start":574.104,"stop":579.401,"duration":5.3},{"text":"One was, that intra city relief had become less valuable while the case was pending because the number of neighborhoods with fewer than 30% black or outside of one mile within a census tract of less than 30% black residence had declined so that there was difficulty getting sites to put enough public housing in areas with more than 70% white population.","start":579.401,"stop":607.489,"duration":28.09},{"text":"Well, I think it is important to ask why that is true and it is true not because of any action by any Governmental Unit.","start":607.489,"stop":615.512,"duration":8.02},{"text":"It is true because of demographic shifts, shifts in residential patterns in the Chicago area.","start":615.512,"stop":622.178,"duration":6.67},{"text":"Thousands of individuals and families made personal choices which they are legally free to make and as result we are told the Federal Courts must pursue those demographic shifts into outlying cities and townships and municipalities.","start":622.178,"stop":638.373,"duration":16.2},{"text":"The Court is not pursuing Governmental action, or anything connected with Governmental action.","start":638.373,"stop":644.387,"duration":6.01},{"text":"They are pursuing populations and demographic shifts.","start":644.387,"stop":649.315,"duration":4.93},{"text":"Now, the other thing, the Court of Appeals said and it is quite clear in its opinion, is that it was reacting not to the constitutional violation in Chicago, but it was reacting to the phenomenon of white flight and it was reacting to sociological and demographic predictions about the distant future, 1984 was mentioned, the year 2000 was mentioned.","start":649.315,"stop":674.009,"duration":24.69},{"text":"The remedy in short is actually addressed to a predicted de facto segregation and not to the limited proven de jure segregation in public housing in Chicago.","start":674.009,"stop":688.587,"duration":14.58},{"text":"I happened to think that the sociological and demographic predictions made by the Court of Appeals are not accurate and if sociology were relevant to this Court, to this case, I would think that the remedy chosen to deal with sociological trends is the worst possible remedy one could choose, but that is not the point.","start":688.587,"stop":708.515,"duration":19.93},{"text":"Chasing demographic shifts and attacking purely de facto living patterns I think is not a proper remedial function of Courts and I think this Court recognized that fact in Swann against Charlotte-Mecklenburg and that seems to me sufficient to require reversal of the Court of Appeals here.","start":708.515,"stop":729.401,"duration":20.89},{"text":"But aside from the principle of Swann, there is the holding of Milliken against Bradley.","start":729.401,"stop":736.528,"duration":7.13},{"text":"This violation took place as I have said repeatedly within the City of Chicago and it is therefore inappropriate to frame relief in an area that encompasses 300 other Governmental Units, more than 300 other towns and villages with a complete strangers to the action and to the violation.","start":736.528,"stop":756.612,"duration":20.08},{"text":"Now, respondent's attempted answer to this is that this is not inter-district relief in the Milliken sense because it is not inter-district relief as to HUD, since HUD may operate over metropolitan areas.","start":756.612,"stop":771.938,"duration":15.33},{"text":"That is fallacious, that answer is fallacious for two reasons.","start":771.938,"stop":775.263,"duration":3.33},{"text":"The first is, that this remedy, even if it is nominally directed or actually directed only against HUD in a legal sense, will actually destroy the autonomy and some of the political processes of the cities and housing authorities, who have no connection with the violation in Chicago and secondly, I think it is irrelevant, it is a fallacious answer because the remedy would compel HUD and this cannot be gotten around, this remedy would compel HUD to ignore obligations placed upon it by Congress.","start":775.263,"stop":806.644,"duration":31.38},{"text":"Now, respondent’s argument as to the first point is that the 1974 Act permits HUD to bypass local communities and to deal with private developers.","start":806.644,"stop":821.072,"duration":14.43},{"text":"And that --","start":821.072,"stop":822.566,"duration":1.49}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"With

do not need, they do not want, they have committed no constitutional violation, and they are going to provide the services with a police protection, the fire protection, the additional schooling for
