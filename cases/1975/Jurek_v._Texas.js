Amsterdam","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, but was pre-Furman statute and I will come to those in just one moment, if I may.","start":162.696,"stop":170.293,"duration":7.6},{"text":"I am talking only about statutes enacted since Furman.","start":170.293,"stop":173.623,"duration":3.33},{"text":"The federal government of course has also punished with death, certain killings in course Air Piracy.","start":173.623,"stop":179.931,"duration":6.31},{"text":"Now, these various statutes range in breadth in terms of the crime which is made capital, from the federal statute on the one hand which is narrow one and the statute in Rhode Island which punishes murder by a prison inmate, to broad statutes which make all first degree murders punishable by death and sometimes other crimes as well.","start":179.931,"stop":202.078,"duration":22.15},{"text":"The pre-Furman statutes which this Court mentioned in Furman and whose constitutionally were reserved or I should say largely out of the picture now because they had either been superseded by new legislation as in Ohio, Rhode Island, Virginia, or in Massachusetts where they were not, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has invalidated as cruel and unusual punishment the pre-Furman rape-murder statute in that jurisdiction.","start":202.078,"stop":231.288,"duration":29.21},{"text":"So, we are basically talking to that, about the 34 post-Furman statutes or 35.","start":231.288,"stop":239.323,"duration":8.03},{"text":"Now, these assume a variety of forms, but I think they can fairly be characterize into four major categories.","start":239.323,"stop":249.411,"duration":10.09},{"text":"First of all there are the statutes which involve a bi-fabricated trial, a two-stage trial proceeding, during the first of which, the jury determines whether the defendant is guilty of a crime to find this cap and during the second stage of which the jury considers or the judge considers and this may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, there has been advisory jury, a list of aggravating circumstances and a list of the mitigating circumstances or there may just be aggravating circumstances as in judge with no listed mitigating circumstances, but the unique characteristic of this group of states is a weighing process in which aggravating and mitigating circumstances are supposed to be balanced in some way to determine their sufficiency for the purpose of the imposing the penalty of death.","start":249.411,"stop":299.96,"duration":50.55},{"text":"Now, there are eight states which has have that kind of statute of which statutes of Florida and Georgia, now before the Court are quite represented.","start":299.96,"stop":309.164,"duration":9.2},{"text":"The second of the four categories are statutes which require a finding of some specified fact, where circumstance or condition, in addition to the elements of the crime described as a capital crime, which has to be found, which must be found in order to support the imposition of the capital punishment.","start":309.164,"stop":331.284,"duration":22.12},{"text":"Now, these statutes sometimes have a two-stage proceeding bifurcated trial.","start":331.284,"stop":337.824,"duration":6.54},{"text":"Sometimes they have a one-stag proceeding.","start":337.824,"stop":340.674,"duration":2.85},{"text":"Sometimes as in Wyoming they have both, that is depending on the crime, but the important characteristic here is that there is no weighing or balancing process.","start":340.674,"stop":351.741,"duration":11.07},{"text":"Inquiry is made whether a particular circumstance and aggravating feature exists.","start":351.741,"stop":355.703,"duration":3.96},{"text":"If it does then the death penalty is be imposed.","start":355.703,"stop":358.85,"duration":3.15},{"text":"Sometimes there is a provision that if the aggravating circumstance is found, but a mitigating circumstance is also found, that the death penalty shall not be imposed.","start":358.85,"stop":367.865,"duration":9.01},{"text":"This is the federal statute for example, the Air Piracy Statute and Texas is very good example of this kind of thing.","start":367.865,"stop":374.614,"duration":6.75},{"text":"In Texas, as we will see shortly when we get to the Texas Statue, it is not enough to convict the defendant of capital murder in order to sentence him to death.","start":374.614,"stop":382.37,"duration":7.76},{"text":"In addition to that, three special verdict questions are submitted to the jury and life or death depends on the answers to those three questions.","start":382.37,"stop":391.519,"duration":9.15},{"text":"Now, the Texas Statute is the representative statute and that group is before the Court now.","start":391.519,"stop":396.578,"duration":5.06},{"text":"It looks a little different on its face than many of the other statute in this category because it has this rather unique feature about the determining whether there a probability that the defendant would engage in a continuing course of criminal violence and would be a danger to the society, but it is interesting that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has read into it, some of the ALI aggravating and mitigating circumstances by saying that you answer that question by saying whether the defendant acted under duress, whether the defendant had emotional troubles and that sort of things, so Texas is a fairly representative statute of this second group.","start":396.578,"stop":433.769,"duration":37.19},{"text":"Now, that has nine states in it plus the Federal Statute.","start":433.769,"stop":437.393,"duration":3.62},{"text":"Alright, now third group of capital statutes.","start":437.393,"stop":441.548,"duration":4.16},{"text":"The third group of statutes where, again, capital punishment turns on finding some particular designated fact or condition, but here the fact or condition is built into the definition of the capital crime as element of the crime and here we always have a single verdict trial by the definition and what we are talking about is states in which something narrower than first-degree murder is punishable by death, it maybe called capital murder, and maybe first-degree murder in five situations, but the Jury has to find at the single verdict trial whether the case falls within those situations.","start":441.548,"stop":479.297,"duration":37.75},{"text":"Here there are 11 states and the Louisiana Statute is perfectly exemplary of those states.","start":479.297,"stop":485.825,"duration":6.53},{"text":"The final class is the simplest to describe.","start":485.825,"stop":489.003,"duration":3.18},{"text":"It is simply statutes making all first-degree murder capital, using the fairly common and traditional outlines of first-degree murder that is premeditated and deliberated murder, felony murder, the usual what has always been of some local variation.","start":489.003,"stop":505.642,"duration":16.64},{"text":"First-degree murder in this country and there are seven states in that category and, of course, North Carolina is representative of that.","start":505.642,"stop":511.994,"duration":6.35},{"text":"My bottom-line is obviously that this Court is seeing in the five statutes here before the Court, although all of these statutes are vary bit by bit, a very representative set of the capital punishment statutes which are now in effect in this country.","start":511.994,"stop":527.741,"duration":15.75},{"text":"Now, I want to make one minor point and three major ones about that general description.","start":527.741,"stop":533.913,"duration":6.17},{"text":"My minor point is that these statutes which were summarized in the appendices to the briefs, have to be looked at with some caution in mind because they generally do not fully reflect the local law governing the application of death penalty.","start":533.913,"stop":547.343,"duration":13.43},{"text":"For example, the Georgia Statute says in terms that after a conviction of capital offense, the Court shall resume the trial and hold the penalty trial.","start":547.343,"stop":559.124,"duration":11.78},{"text":"But in fact we know and briefs demonstrate that, a solicitor at that point can simply waive the death penalty and there will be no penalty trial.","start":559.124,"stop":567.601,"duration":8.48},{"text":"The brief of Colorado Public Defender System's amicus curiae in this case points out that the similar Colorado practice is simply to stipulate not to have a penalty trial that practice is used in Texas as well so that there are variety of outlets that do not appear on the face of the statute when the Court examines the description of statute it would be aware of that.","start":567.601,"stop":589.281,"duration":21.68},{"text":"Secondly, there are, of course, general principles of criminal procedure that make these statutes look differently than they look on their phase.","start":589.281,"stop":598.376,"duration":9.1},{"text":"A good example is California where in theory, again, after the defendant is convicted of a capital of crime, the Court if the so-called special circumstances, aggravating circumstances are alleged in the indictment, shall convene a penalty jury.","start":598.376,"stop":612.352,"duration":13.98},{"text":"However, there is a general principle of California Criminal Procedure under 1181 sub-division 7 of the Penal Code, that a Trial Judge has complete discretion to strike from a in indictment allegations of factual matters which enhance penalty, so that the aggravating circumstances can be struck out at the discretion of the Court.","start":612.352,"stop":636.579,"duration":24.23},{"text":"I simply am going to give a sense that the statute should not taken as they are written.","start":636.579,"stop":641.444,"duration":4.87},{"text":"There are couple rather obvious propositions.","start":641.444,"stop":643.224,"duration":1.78},{"text":"One, the statutes are tidier in print than they are in operation and number two, they are a lot tidier at this point in time than they will be if they go on for any period of the time because of the natural tendency of any system to develop shortcuts and outlets and that sort of thing.","start":643.224,"stop":658.491,"duration":15.27},{"text":"Now, the three major points that need to be made.","start":658.491,"stop":660.849,"duration":2.36},{"text":"First, the use of the death penalty at this point in time is therefore characterized in this country by elaborate winnowing processes, involving a selective screening of cases potentially subject to the death penalty and an array of outlets for avoiding the actual use of the death penalty, either by the second stage penalty proceedings in which aggravating and mitigating circumstances are either balanced or adjudicated or else by definitions of the capital crime which narrow the capital crime and set it off from others along often intangible and impressionistic lines.","start":660.849,"stop":708.211,"duration":47.36},{"text":"The contrast I think is striking between capital punishment as it is authorized by these statutes and the next more severe penalty known to our law, life imprisonment, where if you look you will find statute --","start":708.211,"stop":721.192,"duration":12.98}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A.

Amsterdam","textObjs":[{"text":"No, all I was saying at the moment was draw to a factual distinction between the ways in which the states statute use capital punishment and use life imprisonment, it is ultimate thrust of my argument, yes.","start":743.051,"stop":757.333,"duration":14.28}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A. Blackmun","textObjs":[{"text":"And all I am saying is or asking was this not compelled, this very thing compel by our holding in the prior case?","start":757.333,"stop":765.382,"duration":8.05}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony G. Amsterdam","textObjs":[{"text":"No, I do not think that it was necessarily, Mr. Justice Blackmun.","start":765.382,"stop":769.247,"duration":3.87},{"text":"That is the way the states chose to use capital punishment, the decision to have a very narrow class of cases to draw the lines to have aggravating and mitigating circumstances.","start":769.247,"stop":781.394,"duration":12.15},{"text":"I think the very variety of responses indicate that the states could have responded by making all crimes, including jaywalking punishable mandatorily by death, that would have been response to Furman as well.","start":781.394,"stop":792.609,"duration":11.22},{"text":"The particular form which the response took was not dictated by Furman, although of course, the response was a response to Furman.","start":792.609,"stop":800.472,"duration":7.86}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A. Blackmun","textObjs":[{"text":"Are you surprised that we have these new statutes?","start":800.472,"stop":804.345,"duration":3.87}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony G. Amsterdam","textObjs":[{"text":"No, but I think it is remarkable, even though our submission does not basically turn on the nature of there legislative shape, I think it is significant that the statutes are as narrow as they are and the contrast I am seeking to make is between life imprisonment statutes which exist in 52 jurisdictions in this country for 408 crimes without all of these elaborate post talk justifications, the special circumstances, trials, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the very narrow roster of a capital crimes all encrusted with and surrounded by procedures which permit selective application and draw the bottom-line, wholesale evasion of the provisions of the death penalty statutes.","start":804.345,"stop":858.54,"duration":54.19}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A. Blackmun","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, of course selective application is what you argued before twice, is it not?","start":858.54,"stop":863.065,"duration":4.53}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony G. Amsterdam","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":863.065,"stop":864.656,"duration":1.59}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A. Blackmun","textObjs":[{"text":"And you cannot have been surprised, if you read the opinions in 1972 because this kind of thing was forecast, at least in one opinion?","start":864.656,"stop":877.499,"duration":12.84}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony G. Amsterdam","textObjs":[{"text":"The suggestion was certainly made that the legislatures might respond this way and what I am describing simply is I think something that one might not have predicted which is the perpetuation of a whole array of mechanisms for selectivity after Furman.","start":877.499,"stop":900.714,"duration":23.22},{"text":"You might have expected simply that the states would come back and enact mandatory death statutes, for the most part they have not.","start":900.714,"stop":906.983,"duration":6.27},{"text":"For the most part, they have come back with these highly elaborate and articulated winnowing devices.","start":906.983,"stop":911.908,"duration":4.93},{"text":"Now, I am not suggesting for the moment Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think the mandatory statute is mandatory in any sense and that is the point I am going to come back to the moment, but in specific answer to the question, I do think the form that the statutes have assumed is indicative of something less than a broad based acceptance of the death penalty in our society.","start":911.908,"stop":933.744,"duration":21.84},{"text":"It is a regular part of the penal armamentarium of American Society, Life imprisonment, yes, broadly accepted, generally accepted, no particular care to winnow it down, but when the death penalty is involved, all of these selective procedures.","start":933.744,"stop":952.279,"duration":18.53},{"text":"Now my second major point is that in addition to these winnowing devices, there are other procedures in every state in here I come back the mandatory death penalty statutes, so called mandatory death penalty statutes, which permit additional outlets through which potentially capital cases can be processed to non-capital conclusions and the dearth penalty can averted from some defendants, while being applied to other defendants in distinguishable cases on unaccountable grounds.","start":952.279,"stop":988.145,"duration":35.87},{"text":"Some of these procedures are unique to capital cases.","start":988.145,"stop":991.521,"duration":3.38},{"text":"For example, the statutes may provide that in order to charge capital crime, there must be special allegations in the indictment which the prosecutor can simply choose not include.","start":991.521,"stop":1000.154,"duration":8.63},{"text":"Some of these procedures are not unique to capital case.","start":1000.154,"stop":1003.05,"duration":2.9},{"text":"There are common to non-capital and capital cases, but they assume particular importance in capital cases such a commutation, for example, where the action has always been on the death case.","start":1003.05,"stop":1012.014,"duration":8.96},{"text":"The attention or focus of concern, the intensity of using that sort of thing or the procedures very commonly found in jurisdictions where otherwise lesser offenses are not submitted generally, that in capital trial the judge will always, as matter of routine, give the jury the lesser options, so that it can let the defendant off the death penalty.","start":1012.014,"stop":1034.891,"duration":22.88},{"text":"Some of these outlets and procedures are common in all cases, but assume a particular character in significance in capital cases for a variety of reasons I am going to come back to, but the most important of which is that the life death decision is inevitably enormous out of all proportions to the factual differences in the particular cases in which the choice of life or death is made and the nature of the decision by judge or jury to kill a human being, involves an intense, unique, condemnatory judgment that has to be made in often sensational atmosphere of the capital trial.","start":1034.891,"stop":1080.361,"duration":45.47},{"text":"Now, the third point and this will lead me into the constitutional issues specifically about the general array of statutes, Is that I think the difference is among the states are less impressive than the similarities.","start":1080.361,"stop":1092.993,"duration":12.63},{"text":"Although these states differ in technical detail, the government’s brief I think is right in it is amicus presentation in talking collectively about all of them and describing all of the administration of criminal justice in this country as providing, if you will, the road to death with avenues that discretionary mercy shooting of from the beginning of the process to the end.","start":1092.993,"stop":1116.754,"duration":23.76},{"text":"The avenues are different in different jurisdictions.","start":1116.754,"stop":1118.936,"duration":2.18},{"text":"They work differently as technical matter, but basically the sameness, the remarkable sameness of this process appears in all of the five records and all of five statutes that this Court has and in the other statutes as well.","start":1118.936,"stop":1132.071,"duration":13.13},{"text":"Now, that brings me to the two constitutional submissions which are made by the petitioners Jerry Lane Jurek and Stanislaus Roberts in these two cases and by the petitioners and the companion cases and they are first, that death sentences imposed pursuant to systems of arbitrary selectivity of this sort are unconstitutional under Furman.","start":1132.071,"stop":1157.378,"duration":25.31},{"text":"The square a holding in the Furman decision rightly concedes, compels that result and secondly that apart from this specific holding in Furman, the death penalty as it is used or as it is proposed to be use today is an excessively cruel punishment when it is assessed against the history of this country's use of the punishment in this century.","start":1157.378,"stop":1178.411,"duration":21.03},{"text":"Now, these are separate contentions, although they are closely connected and in part three of our brief in Jurek we describe the interrelationship as best we can between the two
