Evans","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.","start":50.332,"stop":55.356,"duration":5.02},{"text":"At issue in this case is one portion of a Federal Power Commission order entered in 1972, which established an optional procedure for the certification of new sales of natural gas by producers to interstate pipelines.","start":55.356,"stop":70.688,"duration":15.33},{"text":"The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the order in every respect, except one.","start":70.688,"stop":76.769,"duration":6.08},{"text":"It ruled that the Commission has no authority under the Natural Gas Act to authorize the future termination of a sale of natural gas at the same time that it authorizes the sale to commence.","start":76.769,"stop":90.68,"duration":13.91},{"text":"This Court granted the Commission’s petition for writ of certiorari to review the validity of this advanced termination issue, which the Commission refer to in its order as pregranted abandonment authority.","start":90.68,"stop":102.073,"duration":11.39},{"text":"The Court simultaneously denied a cross petition by the respondents here seeking to raise the remaining aspects of the Court of Appeals’ judgment.","start":102.073,"stop":111.01,"duration":8.94},{"text":"Although this single feature of the order is before the Court, I think it would be helpful if I outline very briefly the problems at the optional procedure program was designed to meet and the solutions that the Commission devised.","start":111.01,"stop":126.255,"duration":15.24},{"text":"Like several other recent orders that have been before the Court, by the Power Commission, this is one of a number of efforts that the Commission has undertaken in order to fulfill its responsibility to assure an adequate supply of gas to an interstate market that has been increasingly in critical shortage of supply.","start":126.255,"stop":145.382,"duration":19.13},{"text":"The Commission focused here on a particular set of problems, resulting principally from the lengthy rate review proceedings that had been endemic ever since almost the Commission began regulating producer sales.","start":145.382,"stop":159.985,"duration":14.6},{"text":"These lengthy procedures resulted in rate uncertainties that the Commission determined were impeding the willingness of producers to undertake new exploration and development of gas reserves.","start":159.985,"stop":170.666,"duration":10.68},{"text":"Even under the area rate proceedings, the Commission’s rate review function had seemed interminable and even after they were concluded, there were lengthy and very complex traditional review proceedings, two of which this Court -- reached this Court.","start":170.666,"stop":189.834,"duration":19.17},{"text":"The rates collected by the producers during this entire period were under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act collected subject to the possibility of refund if the rates were ultimately determined to be in excess of the level found to be just and reasonable and producers as a consequence were unsure that the funds they had already collected were really there.","start":189.834,"stop":212.06,"duration":22.23},{"text":"So, whether they would have to be refunded nor could they accurately predict how much they could expect to receive as a return on investments, because there was no assurance what the rate was likely to be in the future.","start":212.06,"stop":222.546,"duration":10.49},{"text":"All that they knew for sure is the Commission stated in its order here was that once that they started deliveries to the interstate market, they could not stop, unless they were able to persuade the Commission that the public interest permitted the abandonment of this service.","start":222.546,"stop":239.454,"duration":16.91},{"text":"With the availability of the existing capital and with the prospective rate of return on their investment unsure and with the prospect of an indefinite commitment to an interstate market which were unsettled prices, the Commission found that producers naturally attended to act cautiously before embarking upon new exploration and development and before committing new acreage to the interstate market.","start":239.454,"stop":264.406,"duration":24.95},{"text":"The order here was designed to meet these problems by making available to producers an alternative to the area rate procedure and in the effect giving them the ability to establish rates with certainty over the life of their contracts.","start":264.406,"stop":280.567,"duration":16.16},{"text":"First, the procedure permitted the producers to file for the Commission’s approval, contracts for the sale of new gas to interstate pipelines at initial rates and at fixed incremental rates provided for in the contract above the applicable area ceiling level.","start":280.567,"stop":300.006,"duration":19.44},{"text":"Second, the Commission indicated that it would then conduct in a single proceeding and promptly consider and resolve, whether the sale was one that should be certificated as consistent with the public convenience and necessity under Section 7 and would also consider and determine whether it could approve as just and reasonable, both the initial rate in the contract, as well every fixed increment in the contract.","start":300.006,"stop":326.051,"duration":26.05},{"text":"Third, if the Commission issued a certificate of convenience and necessity and approved the rates specified in the contract, including these increments, the producer was to be free to collect them without risk of refund.","start":326.051,"stop":339.037,"duration":12.99},{"text":"The Commission undertook to the extent that it could to assure the certainty of the rates that it had approved for the life of the contract.","start":339.037,"stop":348.109,"duration":9.07},{"text":"Fourth, and really the only directly pertinent aspect of the order, as far as this case goes, is that the Commission indicated that it would be willing to consider in the same single proceeding at which it would consider certification and approval of the rates.","start":348.109,"stop":364.105,"duration":16},{"text":"It would be willing to consider request by the producer for authority in advance, to terminate service to the pipeline at the end of the contract term.","start":364.105,"stop":372.513,"duration":8.41},{"text":"This is the feature that the Court -- that the Commission titled pregranted abandonment.","start":372.513,"stop":377.875,"duration":5.36},{"text":"The theory was that some otherwise unavailable gas might be attracted to the interstate market if the producers were given advance assurance that at the end of the contract term, he would be free to discontinue deliveries without having to demonstrate, again, at the end of the term that discontinuance was consistent with the public interest at that time.","start":377.875,"stop":399.788,"duration":21.91},{"text":"These benefits of the optional procedure were not without a quid pro quo because the producers was required to live with the rates set in the contract.","start":399.788,"stop":409.024,"duration":9.24},{"text":"He had to waive his right, which he ordinarily would have under Section 4 of the Act to file notice of rate changes for the life of the contract.","start":409.024,"stop":419.308,"duration":10.28},{"text":"He also had to waive his right to receive, under certain applicable area rate orders, to receive contingent escalations of price for existing sales of flowing gas or other purchasers.","start":419.308,"stop":434.841,"duration":15.53},{"text":"And finally, the contract could contain no indefinite pricing clause, that is one that referred to a variable standard, such as what is common in many contracts, an area rate clause, which says that the rate provided for in this contract will reflect the maximum allowed by the Commission under the applicable area rate.","start":434.841,"stop":458.289,"duration":23.45},{"text":"I would like at the outset to make clear what pregranted abandonment feature of the order is not.","start":458.289,"stop":467.72,"duration":9.43},{"text":"Respondents’ contentions here are bottomed on the assumption, which is made repeatedly in their brief that this aspect of the order amounts to a form of deregulation.","start":467.72,"stop":477.316,"duration":9.6},{"text":"That is simply not so.","start":477.316,"stop":478.941,"duration":1.63},{"text":"The Commission has not relinquished its control over the termination of service, nor has it in any way indicated that it is prepared to abandon these explicit statutory standards, governing the termination of service.","start":478.941,"stop":491.132,"duration":12.19},{"text":"On the contrary, the Commission’s order indicates unambiguously that future termination will not be authorized, unless the record demonstrates that the proposed termination will be consistent with the present or future public convenience and necessity, which is the standard under Section 7 (b) of the Act.","start":491.132,"stop":507.715,"duration":16.58},{"text":"This is not deregulation.","start":507.715,"stop":509.529,"duration":1.81},{"text":"A good example of what is deregulation is contained in a Bill pending before Congress, which I even told was approved by the full House Committee on interstate and foreign commerce, HR9464 approved, I am told only yesterday by the Committee, which is a design to assure the availability of adequate supplies of natural gas during this winter and the following winter and it would permit certain sales of natural gas to be made without commission rate regulation in a limited class of cases.","start":509.529,"stop":551.352,"duration":41.82},{"text":"And, Section 6 of this Bill provides that the abandonment provisions of Section 7 shall not apply to those sales.","start":551.352,"stop":559.341,"duration":7.99},{"text":"The effect of that Bill if it is enacted will be to allow the producer consistent with his contract obligations to terminate the sale of natural gas at his will and whenever he wishes without need for any Commission approval, that is deregulation.","start":559.341,"stop":577.2,"duration":17.86},{"text":"The order here would have no such effect, because the Commission would retain full authority and full control over both whether and when termination would take place.","start":577.2,"stop":590.282,"duration":13.08},{"text":"There is another point I would like emphasize, which is that the order in this case is not an order, granting an authority to terminate service at any point.","start":590.282,"stop":598.86,"duration":8.58},{"text":"The order here is simply the establishment of a procedure, by which the Commission has indicated its willingness to consider applications for such authority.","start":598.86,"stop":607.605,"duration":8.75},{"text":"The issue is consequently quite abstract.","start":607.605,"stop":610.531,"duration":2.93},{"text":"It is not whether the Commission will regulate, but rather when and because we are dealing here with the establishment of a procedure, rather than with the grant of any authority, it seems to me that the respondents have very heavy burden of demonstrating that in no conceivable circumstances could the Commission ever authorize termination of service at the same time that it authorizes a certification.","start":610.531,"stop":634.259,"duration":23.73},{"text":"The Court of Appeals in effect held precisely that.","start":634.259,"stop":636.899,"duration":2.64},{"text":"That is that there are no circumstances in which this could be ever be done.","start":636.899,"stop":640.423,"duration":3.52},{"text":"In its view, Section 7 (b) requires that any authorization to terminate service be granted at the time roughly, when the termination is proposed.","start":640.423,"stop":651.689,"duration":11.27},{"text":"There is an irony to that holding.","start":651.689,"stop":654.4,"duration":2.71},{"text":"Until twenty years ago that was in fact the Commission’s position, with respect to Section 7 (b).","start":654.4,"stop":660.25,"duration":5.85},{"text":"The issue was first litigated in Court, in mid 1950s in a series of Sunray of cases, one of which ultimately reached this Court, as I will mention in a moment, a producer in the Sunray litigation has sought a certificate for sales of natural gas to a pipeline and had asked the Commission to limit the certificate to the duration of the underlying contract term.","start":660.25,"stop":683.339,"duration":23.09},{"text":"The Commission issued a certificate, but the client issued it with the limitation requested, on the ground that precisely what the Court of Appeals says here, that it cannot do so except in a separate proceeding, commenced under Section 7 (b) and at the time of the termination.","start":683.339,"stop":701.001,"duration":17.66},{"text":"Well, that went to the Tenth Circuit, which ruled that the Commission was in error.","start":701.001,"stop":705.24,"duration":4.24},{"text":"It held that so long as the Commission exercised its statutory control over the termination, it could do so at the time of certification, as well as at the time of the termination.","start":705.24,"stop":717.349,"duration":12.11},{"text":"It also ruled, however, that because the producers had not demonstrated a reason why he should be allowed to terminate, the Commission’s order should be affirmed anyway and what followed was a petition for a Certiorari by the producer, asking that the case be sent back to the Commission for reconsideration in light of this new holding that it has authority that it thought it had not.","start":717.349,"stop":739.994,"duration":22.64},{"text":"Commission filed a response in this Court saying that on further study of the Court of Appeals' opinion agreed with the legal holding of the court and it did not object to the proposed disposition of the case, which the court in a per curiam opinion, in fact did.","start":739.994,"stop":761.146,"duration":21.15},{"text":"A few years later, there was a second round of Sunray litigation, which did reach this Court, on the merits.","start":761.146,"stop":768.195,"duration":7.05},{"text":"Again the same producer, but different set of sales.","start":768.195,"stop":770.932,"duration":2.74},{"text":"He sought again a limited term certificate and again the Commission tendered an unlimited certificate, this time acknowledging its authority to grant a limited term certificate, but finding that there had not been showing that the public convenience and necessity would be served by doing so.","start":770.932,"stop":788.116,"duration":17.18},{"text":"On review, the Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that while the Commission has authority and acknowledges that it has authority to grant a certificate, which would expire of its own force, it is not required t do so in the absence of adequate showings.","start":788.116,"stop":802.165,"duration":14.05},{"text":"And this Court, subsequently grant a certiorari and affirmed in an opinion for the Court by Mr. Justice Brennan, reported at 364 US.","start":802.165,"stop":809.902,"duration":7.74},{"text":"And, while the only question presented in the case was whether the Commission could properly issue an unlimited certificate, when one of limited duration was applied for, the Court’s opinion, as well as the dissenting opinions plainly presupposed that the Commission had authority under the statute to grant limited terms certificates.","start":809.902,"stop":828.003,"duration":18.1},{"text":"The question was whether it also had the authority not to.","start":828.003,"stop":832.765,"duration":4.76},{"text":"And this Court’s opinion quite pointedly stated at page 157, that there was no contention that the Commission was, and I am quoting, “again indulging in the erroneous notion that it had no power to issue a limited term certificate.”","start":832.765,"stop":849.139,"duration":16.37},{"text":"The Court cited at that point the Tenth Circuit’s opinion in the first round of the Sunray litigation, which in fact established that the Commission had the power.","start":849.139,"stop":857.018,"duration":7.88},{"text":"The Court’s holding, as I read it in the second Sunray opinion here, was that the Commission could properly decline the issue of limited term certificate, if it did so with the recognition that it had authority to grant one.","start":857.018,"stop":872.334,"duration":15.32},{"text":"Respondents have made no effort in their brief to distinguish between the limited term certificates that were involved in the Sunray litigation and the so-called pregranted abandonment authority that is involved here and there is not any distinction between them anyway.","start":872.334,"stop":886.823,"duration":14.49},{"text":"In either case, the Commission simultaneously authorizes the commencement of a sale and the future termination of the sale at the date certain without need for additional and subsequent Commission approval at the end of the term.","start":886.823,"stop":901.846,"duration":15.02},{"text":"Nor do respondents even acknowledge the existence of the this Court’s statement in this Sunray opinion, concerning the power to issue the limited terms certificate, much less did they attempt to explain why there is not a full answer to their contentions here.","start":901.846,"stop":914.542,"duration":12.7},{"text":"They prefer to ignore that aspect of the Sunray opinion and to focus on language elsewhere in the opinion from which they seem to draw some comfort, unduly I think and that was also the Court of Appeals error.","start":914.542,"stop":930.523,"duration":15.98},{"text":"The language relied upon by both the Court of Appeals and by the respondents relates only to the dangers that the Court perceived from a holding that the Commission work was compelled to grant a limited certificate merely because it was requested by the applicant.","start":930.523,"stop":948.882,"duration":18.36},{"text":"The order here does not have any of those dangers and that language, it seems to me, totally inapplicable.","start":948.882,"stop":954.077,"duration":5.2},{"text":"The Commission has made clear that it would not automatically grant abandonment authority on a producer's request, but require a showing that the public interest would thereby be served and as we indicate in footnote 9 of our brief, at pages 17 to 18, the Commission has in fact rejected such requests precisely because no such showing was made.","start":954.077,"stop":975.082,"duration":21},{"text":"In light of this history, it seems to us the case is very simple.","start":975.082,"stop":979.631,"duration":4.55},{"text":"The short of it is that Section 7 (b) simply does not address the question of when the Commission may properly authorize the termination of service.","start":979.631,"stop":987.881,"duration":8.25},{"text":"It is designed as the legislative history reflects merely to ensure that the Commission has control over the termination.","start":987.881,"stop":995.823,"duration":7.94},{"text":"It leaves to the Commission to question of when that control is going to be exercised.","start":995.823,"stop":1001.081,"duration":5.26},{"text":"The respondent's contention that the Commission cannot possibly foresee at the time of certification what the public interest will be at the time of termination, really rests on a faulty premise that the only proper inquiry for the Commission is whether the public would need to gas at a date after the proposed termination.","start":1001.081,"stop":1021.37,"duration":20.29},{"text":"Well, that is just no right.","start":1021.37,"stop":1022.655,"duration":1.28},{"text":"There is nothing in the Act that forecloses the Commission from considering as one element of the public -- of the present or future public convenience and necessity.","start":1022.655,"stop":1035.178,"duration":12.52}]},{"speakerName":"William J.
