you know, the Court of Appeals, in this case, disagreed with that argument which we made indicated that the Commission had obviously reached a final conclusion as to this issue and that the interest of justice required the court to reach the issue at that juncture because the Commission had made that ruling in a number of other cases and the court felt that there was no indication that any further elaboration of that issue would help resolve the question of the Commission’s power at that juncture.","start":118.149,"stop":153.855,"duration":35.71},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, having

supplier, for direct sales of electricity to industry.","start":193.695,"stop":201.926,"duration":8.23},{"text":"And Conway alleged that by raising the wholesale rate to it while keeping the retail

205 of the Federal Power Act, the Commission is charged with assuring the justness and reasonableness of wholesale electric rates in interstate

Commission concluded that it could not as Conway was suggesting based the wholesale rate on the non-jurisdictional retail rates.","start":262.716,"stop":272.372,"duration":9.66},{"text":"The Commission said and this occurs at page 53 of the record, “Wholesale rates must recover allocated wholesale costs.","start":272.372,"stop":280.99,"duration":8.62},{"text":"Conway suggested relief as a rate not related to wholesale costs but rather related to Arkansas Power’s industrial rate.”","start":280.99,"stop":289.217,"duration":8.23},{"text":"“However, that industrial rate,” the Commission said, “is subject to the sole jurisdiction of the State Commission and not the Federal Power Commission.”","start":289.217,"stop":298.632,"duration":9.42},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed holding that the Federal Power Commission had a responsibility under Sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act to remedy an alleged discrimination between a jurisdictional wholesale rate and a non-jurisdictional retail rate cause by, and these are the court’s words, “the utility’s own decision to depress certain retail revenues in order to curb retail competition from its wholesale

to any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission can only be understood with reference to the legislative history of the 1935 Power Act, and perhaps more important, the impact of this Court’s 1914 decision in the Shreveport Case upon that legislative history.","start":351.105,"stop":378.489,"duration":27.38},{"text":"Briefly, Shreveport involved the question of the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Interstate Commerce Act to remedy a discrimination between jurisdictional wholesale railroad rates and non-jurisdictional intrastate railroad rates set by the Texas Railroad Commission.","start":378.489,"stop":399.353,"duration":20.86},{"text":"Based on this Court’s view of the broad and unexceptional language of the antidiscrimination provisions in the Interstate Commerce Act, this Court in 1914 concluded that the Commerce Commission could require an increase of a non-jurisdictional intrastate rate which discriminated against interstate commerce.","start":399.353,"stop":423.096,"duration":23.74},{"text":"The Shreveport Case figured prominently in the 1935 debates or hearings, I should say, on the Wheeler-Raybum Bill which with

service.”","start":436.829,"stop":460.086,"duration":23.26},{"text":"At the hearings on the Bill, the solicitor of the Federal Power Commission who was a draftsman of the Bill was asked if the Shreveport case would apply if the retail rates were so low that for a company to exist, it became necessary to charge exorbitant rates for its wholesale interstate business.","start":460.086,"stop":481.045,"duration":20.96},{"text":"He argued that it would not apply to the Bill as drafted and maintained and this is a quote.","start":481.045,"stop":487.203,"duration":6.16},{"text":"“The intrastate rate should be determined upon its reasonable,” excuse me I

terms.","start":505.503,"stop":523.196,"duration":17.69},{"text":"Accordingly, the Act was amended -- the Bill was amended and the words added which became the words of Section

attention.","start":531.205,"stop":539.568,"duration":8.36},{"text":"No public utility shall with respect to any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission maintain any unreasonable differences in rates, etcetera.","start":539.568,"stop":550.784,"duration":11.22},{"text":"Following these amendments, Representative Cole, who was a sponsor of the Bill, stated, “We have tried, I think, successfully to avoid the interjection of federal control into intrastate activities in a way in which the Shreveport Case might permit.”","start":550.784,"stop":569.84,"duration":19.06},{"text":"This wording of the Act has led Justice Jackson concurring in Colorado interstate to make the only statement that a member of this Court has made on precisely the issue involved in this state -- in this case.","start":569.84,"stop":582.683,"duration":12.84},{"text":"And he said at 324 U.S. at 615, the Act forbids discrimination only as between regulated rates and does not forbid discrimination between regulated and unregulated ones.","start":582.683,"stop":600.494,"duration":17.81},{"text":"Despite this legislative history, the Court of Appeals concluded that Section 205, as enacted, did not require that both rates involved in the pattern of discrimination fall within the jurisdiction of the Commission.","start":600.494,"stop":614.774,"duration":14.28},{"text":"The court argued that if Congress had intended to limit Section 205 to competitions merely between jurisdictional rates, it would’ve added to the end of the section the following words, classes of service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, rather than as the act reads merely the words classes of service.","start":614.774,"stop":634.431,"duration":19.66},{"text":"Thus, according to the Court of Appeals, if the Congress had wished to limit Section 205 to discriminations between jurisdictional sales, this is what it would have had to have said, no public utility shall with respect to any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission maintain any unreasonable differences in rates between classes of service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.","start":634.431,"stop":661.285,"duration":26.85},{"text":"However, the repetition of the phrase subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission at the end of Section 205 is obviously redundant because by its terms the statute is already limited to quote “any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission”.","start":661.285,"stop":680.881,"duration":19.6},{"text":"Based on Congress’ failure to repeat this obviously redundant phrase, the Court of Appeal said that the Commission was required to address the question or the issue of discriminations between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional rates.","start":680.881,"stop":696.604,"duration":15.72},{"text":"Its only concession was to say that any sanction imposed by the FPC to remedy in any competitive practice is to be addressed to the jurisdictional rate.","start":696.604,"stop":707.669,"duration":11.06}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"What if the Court of Appeals had just said the Commission could consider it and not

Justice.","start":715.491,"stop":717.291,"duration":1.8},{"text":"I think that the -- our principal analysis of the statute is that we are limited in the matters that we are to concern ourselves with, with matters which may not be the subject of state regulation.","start":717.291,"stop":732.716,"duration":15.42},{"text":"And our view of our statute is that the only discrimination which we may address within the ambit of Section 205 and 206 is the discrimination between jurisdictional rates.","start":732.716,"stop":745.051,"duration":12.34},{"text":"And that is our fundamental submission in this case.","start":745.051,"stop":747.446,"duration":2.39}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Tuttle, is it not true that in making the determination of reasonableness on the wholesale rate, you do have to make some preliminary judgment as to whether costs are probably allocated, do you not?","start":747.446,"stop":758.824,"duration":11.38}]},{"speakerName":"Allan Abbot Tuttle","textObjs":[{"text":"Absolutely.","start":758.824,"stop":760.209,"duration":1.38}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Does that not involve some inquiry under the rate base for the retail rates?","start":760.209,"stop":765.081,"duration":4.87}]},{"speakerName":"Allan Abbot Tuttle","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, it involves an allocation, as you say, of costs.","start":765.081,"stop":769.347,"duration":4.27},{"text":"And there’s no question that we may look to the retail business to the extent of determining that the wholesale rate and the wholesale

service.","start":769.347,"stop":787.216,"duration":17.87}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"But you say the statute makes it impermissible for you to look and see -- assume
