parish.","start":92.28,"stop":96.339,"duration":4.06},{"text":"In Louisiana, our law requires the Districts Attorneys in our state to represent the local governmental units in their districts such as School Boards and Police Juries.","start":96.339,"stop":108.362,"duration":12.02},{"text":"Often times a District Attorney will have three parishes in his district which gives him three School Boards, three Police Juries to advice.","start":108.362,"stop":116.788,"duration":8.43},{"text":"Of course he is primarily a county prosecutor.","start":116.788,"stop":120.132,"duration":3.34},{"text":"Criminal Law; our District Attorneys are generally understaffed and overworked and their assistants, the view that they have are trained primarily in Criminal Law.","start":120.132,"stop":131.839,"duration":11.71},{"text":"But we do not have for our School Boards unfortunately and our Police Juries a battery of lawyers such as the Solicitor General and Justice Department have, or the lawyers committed to Civil Rights under the Law or even lawyers with the expertise and knowledge in Constitutional Law that Mr. Halpin has from the many cases he has handled with the AC, American Civil Liberties Union.","start":131.839,"stop":153.995,"duration":22.16},{"text":"I say that not to present a David and Goliath type picture, but merely so that the Court will understand that back in 1971, 68 to 71 when this was in -- the case was in the District Court, that School Board and Police Jury was relying on the advice of an Assistant District Attorney who really had not a great deal of experience in this area of the law.","start":153.995,"stop":176.807,"duration":22.81},{"text":"And also, the second point, this

out.","start":205.438,"stop":223.66,"duration":18.22},{"text":"The Louisiana Legislature in 1968 adopted a law which would permit School Boards to reapportion themselves, that was Act 561.","start":223.66,"stop":235.001,"duration":11.34},{"text":"A similar and not seminar law, but to the same effect was suggested by the Police Juries, Act 445.","start":235.001,"stop":243.885,"duration":8.88},{"text":"It is animated and the plaintiffs -- respondent’s brief and the government's brief that because in prior years the School Board members and the Police Jury members had been elected from wards within a parish.","start":243.885,"stop":261.878,"duration":17.99},{"text":"That when the Legislature switched to a reapportionment plan which would permit At-Large Districts that there was some invidious motive in switching from single member districts, if you could call our Police Jury Ward Single-member District, they really were not, because some of them were Multi-Member.","start":261.878,"stop":280.917,"duration":19.04},{"text":"But the switch-in from that system to a possible Permissive At-Large System was designed to

feature.","start":362.939,"stop":369.203,"duration":6.26},{"text":"We spent, myself and Mr. James Prescott who was Executive Secretary of the Louisiana School Boards Association about two years with numerous phone calls and correspondents trying to convince the Attorney General that since that the at-large feature was permissive and since the Voting Rights Act would require submission of local governmental units reapportionment plans to him, there was no need for him to object to the State Legislation and not only that, but because of his objection we now find that some School Boards, I say them particularly because I represent them more than I do Police Juries, could not reapportion because of the inoperativeness of the State Legislation.","start":369.203,"stop":410.632,"duration":41.43}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"It was authorizing Legislation was not
