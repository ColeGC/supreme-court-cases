Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":8.604,"stop":11.039,"duration":2.44},{"text":"This lawsuit seeks personal money damages against a former Attorney General of the United States for doing his job, allegedly with an improper motive, yet the Attorney General, like the Federal prosecutor in Idaho who sought the material witness warrant at issue in this case, was performing the functions of his office.","start":11.039,"stop":28.983,"duration":17.94},{"text":"There are three reasons why the Petitioner should not be personally liable for money damages.","start":28.983,"stop":33.654,"duration":4.67},{"text":"The first is because the prosecutor's act of seeking the material witness warrant is integrally associated with the judicial process and entitled to absolute immunity.","start":33.654,"stop":43.26,"duration":9.61},{"text":"To view it any other way is to expose both line prosecutors and high officials to lawsuits by highly incentivized litigants based on their purportedly bad motives.","start":43.26,"stop":53.385,"duration":10.13},{"text":"That is something this Court has manifestly resisted and for good reason, because improper motives are easy to allege and hard to disprove.","start":53.385,"stop":61.222,"duration":7.84},{"text":"Allowing such suits to proceed would result in burdensome litigation and interfere with the ability of prosecutors to do their jobs.","start":61.222,"stop":68.494,"duration":7.27},{"text":"The second reason is that the Fourth Amendment was not violated, and, therefore, qualified immunity applied.","start":68.494,"stop":74.214,"duration":5.72},{"text":"There can be little doubt that the statutory requirements of section 3144 were met in this case, and, equally, there can be little doubt that the subjective motivations of Attorney General Ashcroft or the line prosecutor are thoroughly irrelevant to whether a Fourth Amendment violation exists.","start":74.214,"stop":90.991,"duration":16.78},{"text":"This Court has repeatedly rejected subjectivity, explaining that otherwise time-consuming, vexatious, burdensome, and, indeed, destabilizing discovery and litigation would be the inexorable result.","start":90.991,"stop":102.532,"duration":11.54},{"text":"And the third reason, and the easiest reason, is that whatever one thinks the applicable law is, what it -- it was manifestly not the law in 2003 when the warrant in this case was issued by a neutral judge in Idaho.","start":102.532,"stop":114.506,"duration":11.97}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Can I ask whether your second reason doesn't boil down to saying that it makes very

in this case is one about whether motivations matter for the Fourth Amendment; whereas the motivation question in the absolute immunity sense, as Respondents see it, is -- is something broader.","start":166.039,"stop":179.197,"duration":13.16},{"text":"It's not limited to the Fourth Amendment, per se.","start":179.197,"stop":181.13,"duration":1.93},{"text":"Their argument is if the prosecutor is -- has bad motives essentially or a certain bad motive, an investigatory or purposeful bad motive to engage in preventive detention, that somehow pierces the veil of absolute immunity.","start":181.13,"stop":193.687,"duration":12.56},{"text":"That is something this Court has never accepted.","start":193.687,"stop":196.456,"duration":2.77}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I thought the -- I thought the argument, rather, was that this is not as close to the core of the prosecutorial function as some of the other functions to which we

conduct.","start":196.456,"stop":225.726,"duration":29.27},{"text":"But I don't understand why if we agree with you on qualified immunity, there is any difference

point.","start":252.143,"stop":254.661,"duration":2.52},{"text":"Now, with respect to whether this is intimately associated with the judicial process, these are material witness warrants being sought in connection with an ongoing investigation by a prosecutor.","start":254.661,"stop":266.486,"duration":11.82},{"text":"It is quintessentially a prosecutorial function to obtain these warrants and has
