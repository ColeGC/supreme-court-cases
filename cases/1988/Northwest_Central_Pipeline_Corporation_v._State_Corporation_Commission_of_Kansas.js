Commission which is designed to alter the purchasing practices of interstate natural gas pipelines that are regulated under the Natural Gas Act.","start":23.655,"stop":42.238,"duration":18.58},{"text":"I say it's another case because on two prior occasions, in 1958 in Cities Service Gas Company versus The Kansas Corporation Commission and in 1963 in Northern Natural Gas Company versus The Kansas Corporation Commission, this Court held invalid Kansas Corporation Commission regulations which intruded on federal regulation under the Natural Gas Act.","start":42.238,"stop":67.075,"duration":24.84},{"text":"There as here the Kansas Corporation Commission contended that those regulations were necessary for it to carry out its functions in the regulation of production from Kansas fields.","start":67.075,"stop":80.445,"duration":13.37},{"text":"In Northern Natural Gas Company, this Court squarely held that the Kansas Corporation Commission could not either directly or indirectly intrude on federal regulation of purchasing practices of interstate pipeline companies.","start":80.445,"stop":95.823,"duration":15.38},{"text":"And it therefore held that a Kansas regulation which had directed a pipeline company to take gas in a certain manner in that field

decision although the gas in that case was federally deregulated.","start":107.032,"stop":120.25,"duration":13.22},{"text":"Since the gas in this case is old gas, gas that remains subject to federal

Transcontinental.","start":120.25,"stop":136.332,"duration":16.08},{"text":"Now, the Kansas Commission contends they have... that they have circumvented this Court's prohibitions in Northern Natural

penalty.","start":163.367,"stop":177.598,"duration":14.23},{"text":"It's for this reason that we contend that the regulation in this case is the same type of case that we had in Northern Natural, but

facts.","start":189.275,"stop":191.787,"duration":2.51},{"text":"The regulation that we're talking about in this case applies to the Kansas Hugoton Field.","start":191.787,"stop":197.353,"duration":5.57},{"text":"It is one of the largest, if not the largest, gas field and one of the old gas fields in the United

contracts.","start":203.017,"stop":211.632,"duration":8.62},{"text":"The natural gas pipeline companies that purchase gas in this field have invested hundreds of millions of collars in pipeline facilities to take gas in the field.","start":211.632,"stop":220.467,"duration":8.84},{"text":"And those facilities were authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission upon a showing that there would be sufficient reserves to support the investments that were made.","start":220.467,"stop":231.244,"duration":10.78},{"text":"The gas which Northwest Central and other pipelines take in this field is commingled with gas which they take from other sources in other states.","start":231.244,"stop":238.749,"duration":7.5},{"text":"This gas is transported and sold in interstate commerce

cost.","start":263.083,"stop":274.033,"duration":10.95},{"text":"And, therefore, the cost to purchase gas is subject to very, very close scrutiny by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission including

Kansas.","start":286.349,"stop":292.994,"duration":6.65},{"text":"Under Kansas law, the objective is for the regulation to provide that each owner in a common pool will get its fair share of the gas in place.","start":292.994,"stop":304.571,"duration":11.58},{"text":"So, the purpose of the law is not to promote Kansas gas, but rather to provide a basis upon... in which each producer will get his share of the gas.","start":304.571,"stop":312.418,"duration":7.85},{"text":"In doing that, Kansas establishes allowables for each well on a monthly basis.","start":312.418,"stop":319.742,"duration":7.32},{"text":"The allowables are basically a limit on how much well... how much each well can produce.","start":319.742,"stop":323.414,"duration":3.67},{"text":"And because wells in the Kansas Hugoton Field do not produce uniformly because the purchaser's requirements are for different or for
