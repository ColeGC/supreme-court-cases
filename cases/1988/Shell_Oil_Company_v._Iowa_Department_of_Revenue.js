whether the State of Iowa may tax the income earned by Shell Oil Company in the extraction of oil and gas from the outer continental shelf.","start":62.24,"stop":75.398,"duration":13.16},{"text":"Simply stated, Iowa requires Shell to take its OCS earnings into account in figuring out its Iowa income tax liability, with the result being that the more money Shell earns on the outer continental shelf, the more Iowa income tax it generally pays.","start":75.398,"stop":92.86,"duration":17.46},{"text":"It's our position that State taxation of this sort is prohibited by the language, the legislative history, and the purposes and policies of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which demonstrate, we believe, that Congress meant to prohibit the States from taxing any portion of OCS revenue.","start":92.86,"stop":110.221,"duration":17.36},{"text":"Iowa, on the other hand, contends that the Act contains an implied exception for apportioned income taxes.","start":110.221,"stop":116.875,"duration":6.65},{"text":"Let me begin by briefly explaining the background of this dispute.","start":116.875,"stop":121.362,"duration":4.49},{"text":"Shell engages in substantial exploration for oil and gas on the outer continental shelf, pursuant to Federal leases.","start":121.362,"stop":128.533,"duration":7.17},{"text":"Now, it's relatively easy for Shell to figure out its net income from these OCS operations, because the oil and gas has a definite and easily ascertainable fair market value at the wellhead, and Shell also knows what its expenses are in extracting the oil and gas from the shelf.","start":128.533,"stop":145.227,"duration":16.69},{"text":"In fact, Shell has to figure out, make these precise calculations for a number of Federal purposes, such as the windfall profits tax, the oil depletion allowances, and most importantly, in figuring out the amount it owes to the Federal Government as royalties on these Federal leases.","start":145.227,"stop":159.487,"duration":14.26},{"text":"Now, Shell also does business in Iowa, and as a result, it's subject to Iowa's corporate income tax.","start":159.487,"stop":165.474,"duration":5.99},{"text":"Now, Iowa, like virtually every State, determines the Income tax liability for a multi-state business through use of a formula apportionment method.","start":165.474,"stop":175.58,"duration":10.11},{"text":"It starts with the corporation's Federal income tax base, its net income for Federal income tax purposes, and it then subtracts from that Federal income tax amounts that it either can't Constitutionally tax, such as items that may not be part of the unitary business, or items that Congress by statute has prohibited it from taxing, such as, for example, the interest on Federal securities.","start":175.58,"stop":201.647,"duration":26.07},{"text":"Now, what is left then is the Iowa income tax base.","start":201.647,"stop":205.699,"duration":4.05},{"text":"Then multiplies that by a percentage... in most States, that percentage is based on three factors of payroll, property and sales.","start":205.699,"stop":214.455,"duration":8.76},{"text":"As the Court is aware from its decision in Poorman, Iowa uses a one factor sales formula with the numerator being sales in Iowa, and the denominator being sales everywhere.","start":214.455,"stop":226.929,"duration":12.47},{"text":"Then multiplies that Iowa income base by this fraction, and it comes up with the corporation's Iowa taxable income.","start":226.929,"stop":234.202,"duration":7.27},{"text":"Now, when Shell computed its Iowa income for the years in question, it subtracted from its Federal income base the amounts it earned from the extraction of oil and gas from the outer continental shelf, and it did that based on the provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which
