Gresham","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":59.93,"stop":63.537,"duration":3.61},{"text":"In this case the Court must determine whether it will apply its longstanding practice of borrowing the analogous State statute of limitations and apply that to a free speech claim under Title I of the LMRDA, or whether it will apply the narrow exception to that normal borrowing procedure which was described in DelCostello v. Teamsters, and in applying that exception, then select the six-months' limitation period of 10(b) of the NLRA.","start":63.537,"stop":97.758,"duration":34.22},{"text":"The facts in this case indicate that it is a prototypical Title I claim.","start":97.758,"stop":104.16,"duration":6.4},{"text":"It is retaliation against a union member for protesting both the improper use of union funds and for opposing a dues increase in the local.","start":104.16,"stop":115.469,"duration":11.31},{"text":"What are these facts?","start":115.469,"stop":118.483,"duration":3.01},{"text":"Well, Mr. Reed was the treasurer of his local.","start":118.483,"stop":120.67,"duration":2.19},{"text":"He discovered that the general chairman was obtaining funds that he was not entitled to.","start":120.67,"stop":126.184,"duration":5.51},{"text":"He was getting funds for the local for time for which the company had paid him.","start":126.184,"stop":131.323,"duration":5.14},{"text":"Mr. Reed demanded repayment of this money from the general chairman.","start":131.323,"stop":136.633,"duration":5.31},{"text":"At the same time, during the same time period, he opposed the general chairman's efforts to get a dues increase in the local.","start":136.633,"stop":143.615,"duration":6.98},{"text":"Reed went so far as to tell the auditor from the international about the general chairman's double dipping, getting union funds for work where he'd been paid by the company.","start":143.615,"stop":155.267,"duration":11.65},{"text":"What was the auditor's response?","start":155.267,"stop":157.36,"duration":2.09},{"text":"He didn't have time to think about that sort of matter.","start":157.36,"stop":160.576,"duration":3.22},{"text":"The auditor, however, then demanded that Reed pay back funds that he had received from the local, funds that had been approved by the local after Mr. Reed had taken time from his job to perform duties for his union.","start":160.576,"stop":174.603,"duration":14.03},{"text":"The reason given: Mr. Reed had not received prior approval; that is, he had not gotten their approval prior to doing the work.","start":174.603,"stop":183.13,"duration":8.53},{"text":"The problem with that response?","start":183.13,"stop":186.098,"duration":2.97},{"text":"There had never been a prior approval requirement.","start":186.098,"stop":190.361,"duration":4.26},{"text":"At the same time that Mr. Reed was being required to repay this money, one of the general chairman's subordinates, the vice general chairman, went to another dissident union member, told him they could get him too, but at that point, they were just after Mr. Reed.","start":190.361,"stop":206.324,"duration":15.96},{"text":"The vice chairman also suggested that perhaps this other union member might want to withdraw from the race for national delegate where the general chairman was also running.","start":206.324,"stop":216.273,"duration":9.95},{"text":"What did Mr. Reed do?","start":216.273,"stop":218.538,"duration":2.27},{"text":"He paid back the money as demanded.","start":218.538,"stop":220.849,"duration":2.31},{"text":"It was equal to about six months of the small stipend that he received for his usual duties as treasurer and he protested to the international president, Mr. Hardin.","start":220.849,"stop":231.908,"duration":11.06},{"text":"And Mr. Hardin denied the protest.","start":231.908,"stop":234.328,"duration":2.42},{"text":"Mr. Reed then tried to apply the same prior approval policy to reimbursement requests by other local members.","start":234.328,"stop":241.216,"duration":6.89},{"text":"He was chastised by the international president and required to pay the money in spite of the fact there was no prior approval.","start":241.216,"stop":249.009,"duration":7.79},{"text":"This discriminatory treatment ultimately led Mr. Reed to file this claim, and the Title I claim, we argue to this Court, is not one which necessitates departure from the longstanding practice of this Court in labor law, as the Court said in DelCostello, as otherwise of borrowing the appropriate state statute of limitations.","start":249.009,"stop":271.392,"duration":22.38},{"text":"The reason that there is no need for such a departure is that the conditions present in DelCostello are not present in this case.","start":271.392,"stop":280.762,"duration":9.37},{"text":"The claim in DelCostello that hybrid duty of fair representation, Section 301 claim under Taft Hartley, unlike the Title I claim, which is simply a straightforward claim, a union member suing union for violation of rights under Title I, this DFR 301 claim directly challenged the collective bargaining agreement.","start":280.762,"stop":306.674,"duration":25.91},{"text":"And the private resolution of disputes under that agreement which are at, as this Court indicated in DelCostello, at the center of the labor law policy passed by Congress in the NLRA and Taft Hartley.","start":306.674,"stop":321.199,"duration":14.53},{"text":"Indeed, I think the hybrid DFR 301 action that was brought in DelCostello is perhaps the most direct challenge that can be made to that consensual process.","start":321.199,"stop":331.648,"duration":10.45},{"text":"What is the worker asking there?","start":331.648,"stop":334.458,"duration":2.81},{"text":"He's asking the federal court to set aside the private dispute resolution.","start":334.458,"stop":337.708,"duration":3.25},{"text":"His basis, to get to court and to avoid the requirements of exhaustion and the way the court would normally look at the arbitration, what must he do?","start":337.708,"stop":347.798,"duration":10.09},{"text":"He must show that the union has failed to properly represent him.","start":347.798,"stop":351.453,"duration":3.65},{"text":"Not only that, he must show that the arbitrator made the wrong decision and, in fact, he was entitled to relief.","start":351.453,"stop":358.654,"duration":7.2},{"text":"He has a very heavy incentive to sue both, the union and the employer, for otherwise he will not collect his full measure of damages.","start":358.654,"stop":366.854,"duration":8.2},{"text":"As this Court indicated in DelCostello, the... it spoke to its concern because there was no doubt that there was an unquestioned impact by the hybrid DFR 301 action on the consensual and private dispute resolutions process, and I think that it was that fact that drove the Court to apply the exception which it did in DelCostello.","start":366.854,"stop":393.28,"duration":26.43},{"text":"This Title I claim, however, does not involve a work place dispute as did DelCostello, DelCostello being that situation where Mr. DelCostello had been terminated from his job.","start":393.28,"stop":406.76,"duration":13.48},{"text":"The other plaintiffs in DelCostello had varying disputes over the work place, layoffs, poor job assignments.","start":406.76,"stop":414.833,"duration":8.07},{"text":"It does not implicate the collective bargaining agreement.","start":414.833,"stop":417.598,"duration":2.76},{"text":"The employer is not a party.","start":417.598,"stop":420.284,"duration":2.69},{"text":"Rather, the claim is very straightforward.","start":420.284,"stop":423.533,"duration":3.25},{"text":"The union member asserts that the union has violated his rights under the union members' bill of rights, Title I of the LMRDA.","start":423.533,"stop":433.405,"duration":9.87},{"text":"This bill of rights was promulgated because of policy considerations present in neither the NLRA nor the LMRDA.","start":433.405,"stop":442.994,"duration":9.59},{"text":"Congress, at the time of the passage of Title I, had become aware that some unions were acting in a very autocratic fashion and, indeed, some unions were corrupt.","start":442.994,"stop":457.207,"duration":14.21},{"text":"Congress was casting for a way to deal with these problems.","start":457.207,"stop":461.159,"duration":3.95},{"text":"One would have been far more direct government interference, but Senator McClellan rejected that approach when he put forward the labor union members' bill of rights.","start":461.159,"stop":471.686,"duration":10.53},{"text":"His approach was by granting union members the rights of free speech, of assembly, of due process, of participation in elections, of the vote, that by applying the very model which had worked so well for this country in the relationship between citizen and government to the relationship between union member and union, that the democratic process itself would correct the abuses which Congress had found.","start":471.686,"stop":500.455,"duration":28.77},{"text":"I think you can see how wide Congress sought to sweep and that it applied Title I not just to unions that are governed by the NLRA or unions that are governed by the Railway Labor Act but, indeed, to all unions, even the agricultural unions which are not subject to the other federal labor policies.","start":500.455,"stop":520.353,"duration":19.9},{"text":"At the time of the passage of the LMRDA, commentators realized that this democratic process which Congress sought to establish was a fragile one.","start":520.353,"stop":532.115,"duration":11.76},{"text":"As Archibald Cox recognized in his article in the Michigan Law Review, most men are reluctant to risk the cost incurred in vindicating those intangible rights that were set out in Title I, and those who sued under Title I ran, in Mr. Cox' words, enormous risk for they were going up against the power, the entrenched power of the union.","start":532.115,"stop":556.917,"duration":24.8},{"text":"But as this Court has noted in Hall v. Cole, the principal beneficiary of these Title I actions is not the individual union member, it is the union membership as a whole, it is the general public interest that labor unions in this country be run democratically.","start":556.917,"stop":575.739,"duration":18.82},{"text":"Indeed, as Justice Marshall in rejecting a six-months' limitation in a case involving similar rights asserted against the government noted, these are the very claims which belong in court.","start":575.739,"stop":588.544,"duration":12.8},{"text":"They do not or should not be curtailed by a short statute of limitation.","start":588.544,"stop":594.652,"duration":6.11},{"text":"Secondly, what about the practicalities of the litigation because that again was a factor which concerned this Court in DelCostello and again drove it away from the usual practice?","start":594.652,"stop":604.664,"duration":10.01},{"text":"I think the practicalities of this litigation indicate that there is a need for the longer state statute of limitations, the analogous statute in this case being the personal injury statute in North Carolina.","start":604.664,"stop":617.097,"duration":12.43}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"And how long is that, Mr. Gresham?","start":617.097,"stop":618.814,"duration":1.72}]},{"speakerName":"John W. Gresham","textObjs":[{"text":"That is three years under [GS1-51-5.]","start":618.814,"stop":622.437,"duration":3.62},{"text":"It is a general statute of limitation for personal injury.","start":622.437,"stop":626.389,"duration":3.95},{"text":"That... that longer state statute of limitations is the more appropriate vehicle, again quoting the language in DelCostello, for this bit of interstitial lawmaking.","start":626.389,"stop":637.807,"duration":11.42},{"text":"As both Archibald Cox recognized in his article and Judge Coffen recognized in his decision in Doty v. Sewall where he applied the normal practice and rejected any exception, there are good reasons for a union member who has suffered internal union harassment not to come forward immediately.","start":637.807,"stop":660.375,"duration":22.57},{"text":"After all, he still has his job.","start":660.375,"stop":662.812,"duration":2.44},{"text":"This is not a work place dispute.","start":662.812,"stop":665.31,"duration":2.5},{"text":"It's a dispute over his rights in the union.","start":665.31,"stop":668.121,"duration":2.81},{"text":"Maybe if the union member keeps quiet, the problem will go away, or maybe someone else will step forward.","start":668.121,"stop":675.338,"duration":7.22},{"text":"After all, I think the union member must always keep in mind those in power, as Judge Coffen indicated, do have long memories.","start":675.338,"stop":685.677,"duration":10.34},{"text":"Yet, if the union membership as a whole and the public interest is to be served, the union member must step forward, and when he does, what must he do?","start":685.677,"stop":695.752,"duration":10.07},{"text":"He must in most cases find and pay a lawyer.","start":695.752,"stop":700.843,"duration":5.09},{"text":"And what must the lawyer do?","start":700.843,"stop":702.936,"duration":2.09},{"text":"The lawyer must investigate.","start":702.936,"stop":704.623,"duration":1.69},{"text":"The lawyer... the lawyer must ensure himself that the facts are there sufficient to meet any challenge under Rule 11 and file his complaint.","start":704.623,"stop":715.368,"duration":10.75},{"text":"That is different from the situation in DelCostello.","start":715.368,"stop":718.913,"duration":3.54},{"text":"The DelCostello plaintiff, Mr. DelCostello, had already lost his job.","start":718.913,"stop":724.756,"duration":5.84},{"text":"He had already lost his arbitration.","start":724.756,"stop":728.082,"duration":3.33},{"text":"He was casting about for one more forum which might bring him relief and might get him back his job and his wages.","start":728.082,"stop":736.376,"duration":8.29},{"text":"Additionally I would note that there were practicalities in the DelCostello litigation after the case was filed.","start":736.376,"stop":744.169,"duration":7.79},{"text":"It's a problem of the two different actions with the two different conceptual underpinnings.","start":744.169,"stop":748.948,"duration":4.78},{"text":"In the issue of damages, as this Court has noted, one collects damages from the union only to the extent that the union has created damages over and above the actions of the employer.","start":748.948,"stop":762.474,"duration":13.53},{"text":"If you apply the short statute of limitations in DelCostello, the 90-day arbitration period, to the action against the employer, you've truncated the damages.","start":762.474,"stop":773.61,"duration":11.14},{"text":"If you apply the long statute, the two-year statute of limitations that this Court found was the most analogous statute to the... for the duty of fair representation claim, you again run head on into the problems of the effect and interference that that long statute of limitations would have on the private dispute resolution process that is at the heart of the collective bargaining agreement, again, not something that you have in this case.","start":773.61,"stop":802.473,"duration":28.86},{"text":"And the difference, the difference in the conceptual underpinnings of these two statutes, brings me to a third point.","start":802.473,"stop":808.628,"duration":6.16},{"text":"In DelCostello there was simply no good state analogy.","start":808.628,"stop":813.204,"duration":4.58},{"text":"The Court thought perhaps after wrestling with the issue in Mitchell, 90 days, the very short statute of limitations for arbitration in most states... some states had 60.","start":813.204,"stop":823.998,"duration":10.79},{"text":"I think some had perhaps a bit more... was not sufficient.","start":823.998,"stop":827.292,"duration":3.29},{"text":"It did not allow the union members sufficient time to come forward if you did have a legitimate grievance.","start":827.292,"stop":833.774,"duration":6.48},{"text":"And the two-year malpractice statute had no... no connection at all with the action against the employer.","start":833.774,"stop":842.77,"duration":9},{"text":"And again, if it were implied... if it were applied, it would again cause that disturbance with the underlying collective bargaining.","start":842.77,"stop":851.563,"duration":8.79},{"text":"I would note that that interference is set forth in the NLRA and in the Taft Hartley Act.","start":851.563,"stop":862.185,"duration":10.62},{"text":"And in the DelCostello case, those were the acts which gave Mr. DelCostello his claim, the act or the action inferred against the union in this Court and the duty of fair representation and the specific statutory right under Section 301.","start":862.185,"stop":878.536,"duration":16.35},{"text":"Those statutes brought forward the problem, the labor policies that were being interfered--","start":878.536,"stop":884.784,"duration":6.25},{"text":"xx reach the issue of is there a limitation other than the appropriate state statute of limitations for the factors I've set out.","start":884.784,"stop":983.712,"duration":98.93},{"text":"But should the Court... should the Court look to see if Section 10(b) is analogous, I think the Court will find that that close analogy... clearly a closer analogy is I believe the language of the Court in setting out its standards in DelCostello... is not present here.","start":983.712,"stop":999.409,"duration":15.7},{"text":"First of all, what did the Court find with regard to the DFR hybrid action and the unfair labor practice statute of limitations?","start":999.409,"stop":1009.234,"duration":9.83},{"text":"They found, if they took the NLRB's position, a complete overlap of those claims.","start":1009.234,"stop":1014.732,"duration":5.5},{"text":"The Court said, not... not yet ready to decide that point, we at least understand that there is a substantial overlap.","start":1014.732,"stop":1021.853,"duration":7.12},{"text":"Yet, with the Title I claim, which involves the internal union procedures used to violate the rights of the union member, both the NLRB and this Court have consistently held that those internal union procedures and that discipline, no matter what the motive, is excluded from the reach of the unfair labor practice.","start":1021.853,"stop":1046.14,"duration":24.29},{"text":"As recently as Pattern Makers' I think in 1985, this Court reaffirmed that the union in its internal procedures was not subject to an unfair labor practice.","start":1046.14,"stop":1057.839,"duration":11.7},{"text":"Indeed, the amicus for the respondent, the AFL-CIO in that case, argued that that exception reached so broadly that the NLRB could not reach the situation where the union tried to discipline members that resigned.","start":1057.839,"stop":1073.443,"duration":15.6},{"text":"I would note that that position is entirely opposite from the one that the AFL-CIO takes in its amicus brief here today where they talk of the substantial overlap of the two claims.","start":1073.443,"stop":1085.344,"duration":11.9},{"text":"Indeed, I think a shift of that major proportion is such as to make the argument of the AFL-CIO what they term in their brief \"content-free\".","start":1085.344,"stop":1094.215,"duration":8.87},{"text":"Additionally, the policy considerations of Section 10(b), as this Court noted in DelCostello, were specifically attuned to that balance which the Court was trying to find in DelCostello, the balance between the worker, the worker with the work place dispute, trying to assert his claim and the need for speedy resolution.","start":1094.215,"stop":1121.392,"duration":27.18},{"text":"The Court found that that was what Section 10(b) was attuned to and that that's what was at issue in DelCostello.","start":1121.392,"stop":1129.232,"duration":7.84},{"text":"That is not what is at issue in this case.","start":1129.232,"stop":1131.887,"duration":2.65},{"text":"There is no work place

effort to set aside that private resolution of the dispute.","start":1137.619,"stop":1143.022,"duration":5.4},{"text":"Thus, Section 10(b) is simply not an appropriate analogy for this case.","start":1143.022,"stop":1150.021,"duration":7},{"text":"Even if the Court were to determine that given the practicalities of the litigation, given the federal policies, given the available limitations, it had to look elsewhere, it is not a clearly more appropriate statute of limitations.","start":1150.021,"stop":1166.482,"duration":16.46},{"text":"Rather, it is an action by a member of
