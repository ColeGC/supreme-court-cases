of law.","start":466.368,"stop":476.99,"duration":10.62},{"text":"The Virgin Islands has, I think, developed a quite delicate social fabric in which it is extremely important that Virgin Islanders

themselves.","start":476.99,"stop":495.804,"duration":18.81},{"text":"And if we had a system where non-residents were admitted to the bar, but were not required to function as the local lawyers do in taking their full share of criminal appointments, if they could in effect hire a mercenary substitute for themselves, I think there would be damage to the system that the District Court has devised for requiring all lawyers to fulfill their share of responsibility equally.","start":495.804,"stop":517.65,"duration":21.85},{"text":"Also, we don't know that the system in Guam is

in Piper.","start":592.682,"stop":596.335,"duration":3.65},{"text":"The, the concern that we have is that if the only problem with admission to the Virgin Islands bar were distance, if we only needed somebody to occasionally answer a motion call on short notice, aside from the District Court's concern that in most cases when that local lawyer appears in pro hac vice cases he answers, not ready, Judge, I didn't know this case.","start":596.335,"stop":617.999,"duration":21.66},{"text":"But putting that concern aside, we have the complicated situation that it is, in the case of the Virgin
