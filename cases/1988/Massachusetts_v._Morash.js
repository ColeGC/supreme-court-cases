Valvo","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":47.762,"stop":50.73,"duration":2.97},{"text":"This case is here on certiorari to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.","start":50.73,"stop":55.213,"duration":4.48},{"text":"The primary issue presented is whether an employer's agreement to pay additional compensation in lieu of vacation is an ERISA employee welfare benefit plan, as the Court below held, or is it a payroll practice outside the scope of ERISA, as the Secretary of Labor concluded.","start":55.213,"stop":73.377,"duration":18.16},{"text":"The facts of the case are as follows:","start":73.377,"stop":76.141,"duration":2.76},{"text":"The employer bank had agreed that employees could forego some or all of an annual vacation leave and, instead, receive payments for the unused vacation time.","start":76.141,"stop":86.809,"duration":10.67},{"text":"These payments came from the general assets of the bank.","start":86.809,"stop":90.151,"duration":3.34},{"text":"In 1985, two employees of the bank were discharged, each with an accumulation of days they had actually worked instead of taking vacation.","start":90.151,"stop":99.32,"duration":9.17},{"text":"Upon their termination, the bank refused to pay for this time worked, and, subsequently, criminal complaints under the Massachusetts Statute, Section 148, were filed.","start":99.32,"stop":110.846,"duration":11.53},{"text":"Upon report from the trial court to the SJC, the SJC held that the prosecutions under the state statute were preempted by ERISA.","start":110.846,"stop":119.859,"duration":9.01},{"text":"Now, if the bank's arrangement is a welfare benefit plan, as the Court below held, then employers with common vacation policies like the bank's, may be required to comply with ERISA's elaborate regulatory provisions, with no real corresponding benefit to employees.","start":119.859,"stop":139.522,"duration":19.66},{"text":"If, however, the practice is a payroll practice, as the Secretary of Labor terms it, the states will continue to enforce statutes like Section 148, which have long been proven to be an efficient and effective means of resolving vacation pay claims, which often amount to no more than a few hundred dollars.","start":139.522,"stop":161.795,"duration":22.27},{"text":"If the SJC is correct, then a disappointed employee's sole remedy, with respect to vacation pay, will be to file a federal ERISA action to claim his... his pay.","start":161.795,"stop":179.148,"duration":17.35},{"text":"Now, whether one views these payments as straight compensation for time worked or as a lump sum amount that aggregates what would have been paid to the employee had he taken vacation, the Secretary's payroll practices regulation controls.","start":179.148,"stop":196.342,"duration":17.19},{"text":"This regulation was promulgated shortly after the enactment of ERISA, pursuant to express and a quite broad delegation of rule-making power to the Secretary, to carry out the provisions of the statute and to define its terms.","start":196.342,"stop":213.664,"duration":17.32},{"text":"And, I might add that, unlike Justice Scalia perhaps, the Secretary had to both read the statute and deal with reality.","start":213.664,"stop":222.379,"duration":8.72},{"text":"He had to make the plan requirements of ERISA work in the real world, so that this payroll practice is a... the regulation is an accommodation of the purposes and history of the statute, as applied to common payroll practices used throughout the nation.","start":222.379,"stop":241.731,"duration":19.35}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra

benefit.","start":261.988,"stop":273.78,"duration":11.79},{"text":"He, at the time, read that statutory provision to include and mean the pooled vacation arrangements that Congress was aware of,

it used it again in 3(1), than the use of the term in the Taft-Hartley Act.","start":315.748,"stop":330.446,"duration":14.7},{"text":"So, I think that it's fair to conclude, as the Secretary did, that Congress was not so much concerned with defining neat boxes of benefits in ERISA that would be in addition to whatever was in the Taft-Hartley enumeration of benefits.","start":330.446,"stop":348.718,"duration":18.27},{"text":"It was just throwing a lot of things into the scope of ERISA, and one of those things was the funded vacation arrangements that
