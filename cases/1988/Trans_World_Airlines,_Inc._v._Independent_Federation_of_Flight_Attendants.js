this Court's decision in Florida East Coast Railway... of course the Court is familiar with that decision, and the discussion of it which we had in the case which we refer to as TWA 1, which is still pending, petition for rehearing in this Court.","start":383.679,"stop":408.829,"duration":25.15},{"text":"The Respondent says that that decision requires the continuation of pre-strike working conditions into and beyond the self-help period.","start":408.829,"stop":419.352,"duration":10.52},{"text":"Respondent argues that therefore the seniority system as it refers to it, in the 1981-84 contract between TWA and IFFA, which the District Court held did not include any right of unreinstated strikers to displace incumbents... that that seniority system somehow expands because of the statute to confer that right of displacement after the expiration date of the contract.","start":419.352,"stop":451.74,"duration":32.39},{"text":"In other words, Respondent says that a right conferred

contract.","start":492.9,"stop":501.006,"duration":8.11},{"text":"And clearly if this Court should hold that the contract including all of the seniority provisions which it did have has expired, there
