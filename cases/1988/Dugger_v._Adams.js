further, we find the presentation of these claims an abuse of the post-conviction procedure.","start":601.554,"stop":611.441,"duration":9.89},{"text":"Rule 3.850 was then set out and it was described as barring new claims as well as successive claims.","start":611.441,"stop":617.824,"duration":6.38},{"text":"And the Florida Supreme Court then concluded and held that the new claims were barred as an abuse of procedure as well as by case law.","start":617.824,"stop":625.841,"duration":8.02},{"text":"And the new Rule 3.850 is a... a codification of prior existing case law barring such new

procedural bars in the context of Caldwell claims being raised on collateral attack.","start":634.795,"stop":648.124,"duration":13.33},{"text":"The court has discussed in its opinions the inapplicability of Caldwell only to demonstrate that no relief can be granted in this area on a 3.850, and it cannot be entertained because Caldwell is not a significant change of law, which is one of the criteria under our post-conviction relief procedure.","start":648.124,"stop":670.689,"duration":22.56},{"text":"Caldwell was discussed in the case of Garcia... excuse me... only to demonstrate the

sentence.","start":681.298,"stop":688.64,"duration":7.34},{"text":"So, in conclusion, the Florida Supreme Court has regularly and consistently applied its procedural bar.","start":688.64,"stop":696.306,"duration":7.67},{"text":"Our contention is that even if the merits of the claim could be reached, Adams is still entitled to no relief because the claim is an adequate description of Florida sentencing procedure.","start":696.306,"stop":710.896,"duration":14.59},{"text":"During voir dire in this case, each time new prospective jurors were seated, the trial judge explained our capital sentencing system to them.","start":710.896,"stop":720.941,"duration":10.05},{"text":"He advised them of the advisory nature of their sentencing recommendation and the fact that he could disregard it and sentence them to either life or death.","start":720.941,"stop":729.446,"duration":8.5},{"text":"In elaborating upon this, he indicated verbally to the jurors, distilled

instructed the jury as to the finding and the weighing of aggravating circumstances.","start":743.047,"stop":750.892,"duration":7.85},{"text":"Proceeding to the penalty phase, the jury was similarly

judge.","start":750.892,"stop":769.564,"duration":18.67},{"text":"At that point in time, however, they were also instructed that they must find sufficient aggravating circumstances not outweighed by the mitigating circumstances and that their verdict should be based on the evidence.","start":769.564,"stop":783.222,"duration":13.66},{"text":"More than that and most important to this case also is the fact that the trial judge drove home to them the importance and the gravity of their undertaking at that particular time in the proceeding.","start":783.222,"stop":796.282,"duration":13.06},{"text":"He stated to them that they should not act hastily or without due regard to the gravity of these proceedings, and he instructed

have any notion at all but their... their recommendation may have the possibility of sealing Adams' fate.","start":812.661,"stop":822.228,"duration":9.57},{"text":"I think that that was driven home to them.","start":822.228,"stop":823.698,"duration":1.47},{"text":"Moreover, the prosecutor admonished the jurors to be fair to the defendant and the people of the State of Florida, and that any way they decide will satisfy the people of the State of Florida.","start":823.698,"stop":835.008,"duration":11.31},{"text":"These statements were an accurate description of Florida law.","start":835.008,"stop":838.428,"duration":3.42},{"text":"Under our death penalty statute, Florida statutes 921.141, a jury is directed to return an advisory recommendation, but the statute

the judge looks for from the jury is essentially in the nature of guidance alone.","start":864.366,"stop":869.739,"duration":5.37},{"text":"And I think that his independent nature as the sentencer is reflected most aptly in a scenario where if the jury recommends death and the trial judge, applying the statutory criteria, cannot find an aggravating circumstance, he's constrained to impose a sentence of lite.","start":869.739,"stop":891.542,"duration":21.8},{"text":"I think that reflects that he is, indeed, an independent and ultimate
