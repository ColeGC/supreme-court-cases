Scanlon this Court reaffirmed the concept that abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity involves a fundamental shift in the constitutional balance between the states and the federal government as well as an expansion of federal constitutional power of the federal courts.","start":57.087,"stop":78.683,"duration":21.6},{"text":"Consequently, the court has held that abrogation of immunity will not be found unless Congressional intent to subject suits to... subject states to federal court suits is unmistakably clear.","start":78.683,"stop":93.86,"duration":15.18},{"text":"This clear statement rule has two fundamental and important reasons.","start":93.86,"stop":99.764,"duration":5.9},{"text":"First of all, it is intended to provide notice to the states who, as in the EHA, have voluntarily agreed to participate in a program to provide equal education to handicapped children.","start":99.764,"stop":115.125,"duration":15.36},{"text":"Secondly, it makes certain that Congress considers directly the problems and issues which would arise if states are subjected to suit in federal court and, therefore, lessens the chance that Congress will act in haste or without giving consideration to the constitutional balance which it will be affecting with its actions.","start":115.125,"stop":139.407,"duration":24.28},{"text":"It is our position that this notice, which is required, especially to the states, has not been given to the 50 states who since 1975 have joined in this Federal Government partnership to provide appropriate education for every handicapped child in America.","start":139.407,"stop":158.285,"duration":18.88},{"text":"The court of appeals in its opinion struggled to find this clear abrogation language and in doing so it pointed to the preamble of the statute found at Section 140C(b)(9) which speaks in terms of the Federal Government's intent to assist the states in providing federal funds so that equal education can be achieved for handicapped children.","start":158.285,"stop":186.054,"duration":27.77},{"text":"That is at page 6 of our petition for cert.--","start":186.054,"stop":189.339,"duration":3.28},{"text":"It also points

party so aggrieved will have the right to bring an action in federal court.","start":189.339,"stop":214.372,"duration":25.03},{"text":"The last basis on which the court of appeals stands is section

there are specific statues, those enumerated, and there are other statutes which specifically are designed to eliminate discrimination in particular areas.","start":317.689,"stop":329.264,"duration":11.57},{"text":"There are entitlement statues usually.","start":329.264,"stop":331.966,"duration":2.7}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day

perhaps.","start":331.966,"stop":338.603,"duration":6.64}]},{"speakerName":"Maria Parisi-vickers","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, this is actually... you could view this as a discrimination statute because it focuses particularly on one group and gives them benefits which other children may not be entitled to, or other groups may not be entitled to.","start":338.603,"stop":353.629,"duration":15.03},{"text":"For those reasons, we believe that it's not a statute which can be lumped into the category of antidiscrimination statute, and, therefore, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments does not apply, both on the merits and as to the applicable date.","start":353.629,"stop":369.674,"duration":16.04}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Now, suppose we were to agree with you, that at least as to the claims that arose before 1986 that there is an Eleventh Amendment bar

remanded.","start":476.243,"stop":479.528,"duration":3.29},{"text":"The attorney's fees issue was improperly decided by the district court and there is a remand on that.","start":479.528,"stop":488.551,"duration":9.02},{"text":"And, therefore, in deciding the issue of the Secretary we will now be able to know whether or not the Commonwealth has prevailed on one or two issues, and that affects the attorney's fees determination.","start":488.551,"stop":510.314,"duration":21.76},{"text":"Going back to the examination of the statute, this court has long since held, at least since 1973, that merely because states have been included among a class of actors is not enough to strip them of their sovereign prerogative of immunity from suit.","start":510.314,"stop":529.045,"duration":18.73},{"text":"And an award of attorney's fees in an amendment such as the 1986 Amendment to the EHA is not sufficient either.","start":529.045,"stop":540.667,"duration":11.62},{"text":"In addition, the Third Circuit used the language of the statute regarding the ability of the federal courts to grant appropriate relief under this Act to find further support for its position that the appropriate relief should be tuition reimbursement.","start":540.667,"stop":560.564,"duration":19.9},{"text":"We note parenthetically that it took a decision of this Court in Burlington to determine that tuition was an... tuition reimbursement was an appropriate relief at all against a school district.","start":560.564,"stop":573.824,"duration":13.26},{"text":"And in that case there was no Eleventh Amendment protection.","start":573.824,"stop":578.126,"duration":4.3},{"text":"We suggest that the power of the federal courts in fashioning appropriate relief is constrained by Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, and that the barrier of sovereign immunity was not removed by the EHA.","start":578.126,"stop":591.035,"duration":12.91},{"text":"And the reason that it was not removed is that Congress did not need to do so.","start":591.035,"stop":596.503,"duration":5.47},{"text":"It could achieve the purposes of the EHA by providing other remedies, remedies which it included in the statute and which are available to children and parents.","start":596.503,"stop":606.711,"duration":10.21},{"text":"Primary among those remedies is the fact that parents, together with their children, participate fully at every stage of the formulation and implementation of the individualized program of education for a child.","start":606.711,"stop":620.638,"duration":13.93},{"text":"If they're unhappy with that program of education, they can appeal the decision of the school district to an administrative hearing.","start":620.638,"stop":629.66,"duration":9.02},{"text":"If they're unhappy with that, there is a judicial remedy... a judicial review in the courts.","start":629.66,"stop":634.962,"duration":5.3},{"text":"Now, once in the courts there is a judicial remedy at least against the school districts.","start":634.962,"stop":641.218,"duration":6.26},{"text":"And in the overwhelming number of cases the tuition reimbursement remedy will be available to litigants because the school districts are the ones which are usually the entitles which formulate the IEP and are in dispute with the parent.","start":641.218,"stop":656.228,"duration":15.01},{"text":"Therefore, in the overwhelming number of cases there will be a tuition reimbursement under the Act.","start":656.228,"stop":662.064,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Moreover, if there is an ongoing violation of federal law, state of official can be enjoined.","start":662.064,"stop":669.035,"duration":6.97},{"text":"So, there is injunctive relief at that level.","start":669.035,"stop":672.403,"duration":3.37}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Counsel, could I... maybe I'm coming back to the same question that Justice O'Connor
