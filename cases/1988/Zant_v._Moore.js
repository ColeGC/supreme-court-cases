Boleyn","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":17.338,"stop":19.712,"duration":2.37},{"text":"This is a second application for federal habeas corpus relief that raises both old and new grounds.","start":19.712,"stop":25.24,"duration":5.53},{"text":"On the new grounds, they allege that a change in the law permits them to present these new claims for the first time in a second or subsequent application.","start":25.24,"stop":34.127,"duration":8.89},{"text":"It's the Petitioner's position that the failure of the Respondent to include these so-called new claims in his first application was inexcusable neglect and, therefore, this application should have been dismissed as an abuse of the writ.","start":34.127,"stop":46.217,"duration":12.09},{"text":"There are three major points which the Petitioner would like to discuss today and these three points are as follows.","start":46.217,"stop":52.089,"duration":5.87},{"text":"First, when a district court is faced with reviewing a second or subsequent application for federal habeas corpus relief that raises new claims based on alleged changes in the law, the district court should not focus on whether or not the decision that's cited by the applicant is in fact new law.","start":52.089,"stop":69.644,"duration":17.56},{"text":"Instead, the proper focus of the district court's consideration should be whether at the time the first application was filed and it was pending in the district court that the claim was reasonably available to the applicant at that time.","start":69.644,"stop":83.139,"duration":13.49},{"text":"The second point the Petitioner would like to make is that reasonably available means was there a sufficient legal basis in existence at the time the first application was filed and during the time it was pending to enable the applicant to raise the claim.","start":83.139,"stop":97.492,"duration":14.35},{"text":"And finally, under our standard that we're proposing to the Court today, the burden would remain on the applicant to excuse his omission of the new claims from the earlier application and to show that it was not inexcusable neglect to fail to include these claims.","start":97.492,"stop":111.956,"duration":14.46},{"text":"If we take the reasonably available standard that we're propounding to the Court today and apply it in the practical context, this is what occurs.","start":111.956,"stop":119.483,"duration":7.53},{"text":"Of course, the applicant files a second or successive application for federal habeas corpus relief and the government, as is its burden, pleads abuse of the writ with clarity and particularity.","start":119.483,"stop":130.181,"duration":10.7},{"text":"And essentially implicit in our response to their second or successive application is our belief that there is no newly available facts and no newly available law which would allow the applicant to raise a claim at this time which he didn't have at a previous application time.","start":130.181,"stop":147.815,"duration":17.63},{"text":"Of course, once we plead abuse of the writ and we say that there's new... no new law, then of course the applicant has to respond to the pleading of abuse of the writ.","start":147.815,"stop":157.577,"duration":9.76},{"text":"And what generally happens is they simply say change in the law and they cite a case for it that was rendered subsequent to the time that the first application was disposed of.","start":157.577,"stop":166.074,"duration":8.5},{"text":"They hope by mouthing what are sometimes thought of as magic words of \"change in the law\", that they can thereby excuse their inexcusable neglect in failing to raise that claim at the first time.","start":166.074,"stop":177.256,"duration":11.18},{"text":"And, of course, they also hope that what will happen is that the district court will look to the government to determine whether or not the claim was reasonably available at that time.","start":177.256,"stop":185.582,"duration":8.33},{"text":"When the district court then is faced with our allegation of abuse of the writ and their allegation that there's new law, what does the district court have to do?","start":185.582,"stop":194,"duration":8.42},{"text":"Well, essentially the district court can't decide whether the decision is new law in a legal vacuum.","start":194,"stop":199.528,"duration":5.53},{"text":"Instead, what the district court has to do is look at the claim and decide whether or not at the time the first application was filed and was pending that the claim was reasonably available.","start":199.528,"stop":210.337,"duration":10.81},{"text":"So, they compare the date of the decision cited back to the date that the first application was filed.","start":210.337,"stop":215.726,"duration":5.39}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Ms. Boleyn, may I inquire how your proposed standard differs from

Boleyn","textObjs":[{"text":"Your Honor, our reasonably available standard differs from the, the standards set forth in Reed v. Ross for the cause standard in several respects.","start":225.362,"stop":233.624,"duration":8.26},{"text":"First of all, our standard is not as high a standard as a Reed v. Ross standard because we don't have the additional element of prejudice.","start":233.624,"stop":240.324,"duration":6.7},{"text":"And second, of course, primarily when you're discussing a procedural default, you're looking at whether counsel failed to preserve the issue and why the issue was not preserved; whereas on our reasonably available standard, the focus that you have is why the claim could not have been presented.","start":240.324,"stop":255.475,"duration":15.15},{"text":"So, really in a procedural default context, a Reed v. Ross type situation, one of the things you're looking at is foreseeability; whereas in our test you have the benefit of hindsight and you can look back to the legal environment as it existed at the time the first application was filed.","start":255.475,"stop":268.673,"duration":13.2},{"text":"Then, of course, too, when you're looking at a procedural default context, the prior proceeding that you're examining is a proceeding in which you had the right to counsel and you had the right to effective assistance because it's trial or appeal.","start":268.673,"stop":279.372,"duration":10.7},{"text":"But in our standard, you're looking at a proceeding where you did not have the right to counsel and so, in effect, it just doesn't factor in.","start":279.372,"stop":285.306,"duration":5.93}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"How does your standard differ from that suggested by Judge Tjoflat below?","start":285.306,"stop":292.07,"duration":6.76}]},{"speakerName":"Susan V.

Ross, and we simply said was it reasonably available, was there a sufficient legal basis for the claim.","start":295.022,"stop":303.003,"duration":7.98},{"text":"And it's similar for the tools language that Judge Tjoflat adopted.","start":303.003,"stop":307.47,"duration":4.47},{"text":"The only thing that Judge Tjoflat did was he referred to the Reed v. Ross language about whether other petitioners were raising the claim at the same time.","start":307.47,"stop":314.201,"duration":6.73},{"text":"And we've simply said in our standard that that might be germane, but it might not be outcome-determinative in determining whether the claim was reasonably available.","start":314.201,"stop":321.371,"duration":7.17},{"text":"So, it's very similar to what he's... what he's alleged.","start":321.371,"stop":323.65,"duration":2.28}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Could you... could you tell me how it could ever be held that the claim... that the claim was not reasonably available when there has been a change in the law?","start":323.65,"stop":340.471,"duration":16.82},{"text":"I mean, almost by definition somebody else thought of it.","start":340.471,"stop":342.626,"duration":2.15},{"text":"So, how could you possibly ever... I mean, why not just adopt a simpler rule that you simply can't do it at all?","start":342.626,"stop":350.249,"duration":7.62},{"text":"Period.","start":350.249,"stop":350.593,"duration":0.34},{"text":"Is there any difference?","start":350.593,"stop":352.342,"duration":1.75}]},{"speakerName":"Susan V.
