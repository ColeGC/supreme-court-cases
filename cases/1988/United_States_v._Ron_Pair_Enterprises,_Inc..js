the result for which they contend, not only because of the ambiguity that would then exist, but because the Code elsewhere, when it wants to refer only to consensual secured claims, uses a term of

liens.","start":990.322,"stop":997.116,"duration":6.79},{"text":"But those cases did not hold what the language of 506(b) obviously would require, that a court would have to look to the terms of the

Congress enacted are to be totally ignored, contrary to every principle of approaching statutory construction.","start":1021.029,"stop":1035.303,"duration":14.27},{"text":"Now, in addition to the language of the statute, the context rather strongly suggests that oversecured claims are referred to comprehensively in Section 506(b).","start":1035.303,"stop":1050.392,"duration":15.09},{"text":"It

Section 506(b) more narrowly.","start":1075.6,"stop":1085.378,"duration":9.78},{"text":"Then if we look to the legislative history, it simply does not address this question, which seems on balance to
