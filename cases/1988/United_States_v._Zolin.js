Horowitz","textObjs":[{"text":"Getting back to what I said before, there's a summons there and if the IRS is entitled to enforcement, the court is supposed to compel enforcement of the summons, not change it.","start":3193.875,"stop":3201.2,"duration":7.32},{"text":"And there has been litigation on that kind of subject.","start":3201.2,"stop":3204.699,"duration":3.5},{"text":"I'd like to talk briefly about this idea of abuse of process because it seems to me this is just the core of Respondents' argument.","start":3204.699,"stop":3211.43,"duration":6.73},{"text":"Is that the notion the courts have an inherent authority to prevent abuse of their process basically gives them carte blanche in whatever sort of order they want in a case like this.","start":3211.43,"stop":3221.801,"duration":10.37},{"text":"We don't deny there's inherent authority to control abuse of process, but there's nothing like that going on here.","start":3221.801,"stop":3226.988,"duration":5.19},{"text":"This is discussed at great length by this Court in Powell case and follows through in subsequent summons enforcement cases.","start":3226.988,"stop":3233.624,"duration":6.64},{"text":"We know what abuse of process is in this context and it is the issuance of a summons in bad faith for an illegitimate purpose that is not encompassed by the congressional grant of authority and the other is sort of power criteria.","start":3233.624,"stop":3246.572,"duration":12.95},{"text":"If the court were... if the IRS were to get a summons under the circumstances where it did not satisfy those criteria, that would be an abuse of the court's process, and the court is entitled to protect itself against that.","start":3246.572,"stop":3258.099,"duration":11.53},{"text":"And that's why there is a summons enforcement proceeding.","start":3258.099,"stop":3260.426,"duration":2.33},{"text":"In this case, and in most cases, the court looked at those criteria and it found... and it found quite unequivocally that there was no bad faith.","start":3260.426,"stop":3269.453,"duration":9.03},{"text":"That the IRS was entitled to enforcement of its summons.","start":3269.453,"stop":3271.609,"duration":2.16},{"text":"That ends the abuse of process inquiry, and it does not give this kind of carte blanche for the court to go out there to see what the IRS is going to do with the documents down the road.","start":3271.609,"stop":3281.246,"duration":9.64},{"text":"And I should mention, I guess, that all through summons enforcement law you see that the court does not really take it upon itself to worry about what the IRS does with documents down the road.","start":3281.246,"stop":3293.1,"duration":11.85},{"text":"In the LaSalle case, of course, there was a great controversy over whether the summons should be enforced there because of the danger at that time information would immediately infringe on criminal discovery and the role of the grand jury because there had already been a criminal referral in effect.","start":3293.1,"stop":3309.438,"duration":16.34},{"text":"But, of course, in the typical IRS investigation where there is no criminal referral in effect, documents are furnished to the IRS pursuant to a summons and then later on down the road, a year later, a year and a half later, the case may be referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.","start":3309.438,"stop":3323.213,"duration":13.78},{"text":"And that information that came through the summons goes to the Justice Department at that point.","start":3323.213,"stop":3327.851,"duration":4.64},{"text":"And there's nothing wrong with that.","start":3327.851,"stop":3328.835,"duration":0.98},{"text":"That doesn't show abuse of the court's process or bad faith, or anything like that.","start":3328.835,"stop":3332.865,"duration":4.03},{"text":"The idea of the summons enforcement proceeding is to decide at that time whether the summons should be enforced.","start":3332.865,"stop":3337.097,"duration":4.23},{"text":"As far as the benignness of this particular restriction, we think the real problem here is that there is no way to draw a line between the kind of restriction that the court imposed here and much broader and more intrusive restrictions.","start":3337.097,"stop":3350.531,"duration":13.43},{"text":"If the court has the authority to monitor the IRS' investigation, as the Ninth Circuit says, then there will be other... a lot of litigation and a lot of other restrictions that are very damaging.","start":3350.531,"stop":3359.215,"duration":8.68},{"text":"Just to quickly summarize the attorney/client issue.","start":3359.215,"stop":3363.307,"duration":4.09},{"text":"Of course, we don't concede that there is any independent evidence requirement.","start":3363.307,"stop":3366.663,"duration":3.36},{"text":"When I was induced to concede that the district court would have to at least have some evidence before it made an in camera inspection, there's certainly no reason why that evidence has to be independent in the sense that Respondent was talking about.","start":3366.663,"stop":3382.33,"duration":15.67},{"text":"Neither the court of appeals nor Respondents have given any reason why there should be such a rule, and we suggest that there shouldn't be one.","start":3382.33,"stop":3388.125,"duration":5.8},{"text":"But, again, the issue in this case is whether the court is precluded from ever looking at so-called nonindependent evidence before it decides whether the attorney/client privilege should be taken away because of crime-fraud.","start":3388.125,"stop":3400.323,"duration":12.2},{"text":"Thank
