said about that, concerning specifically the former wife, both their support of the CIA employee spouse and their direct contribution... and Congress was referring to the agency... often prevented the

very precise, carefully managed system for disposable retired income.","start":724.648,"stop":735.003,"duration":10.36},{"text":"And they defined disposable to exclude a number of things.","start":735.003,"stop":737.824,"duration":2.82},{"text":"And among the things that it excluded is VA and the taxes and a number of other things that I can set out forth a whole list, if you'd like.","start":737.824,"stop":748.871,"duration":11.05},{"text":"But, but the answer is that this Court invited Congress to provide more protection, if Congress thought the former spouse should have some.","start":748.871,"stop":757.748,"duration":8.88},{"text":"And they had some options in front of them, various ways they'd done things in the

plain meaning of the law that they did pass demonstrates that they only meant to allow disposable retired pay to be divided, as opposed to these other things they could have done that were before them at the time.","start":765.104,"stop":779.792,"duration":14.69},{"text":"Starting with the language of 3101, which is the... the anti-attachment statute though, I think just analyzing the language of that shows that those benefits can't be reached.","start":779.792,"stop":793.781,"duration":13.99},{"text":"In the first place, it says the benefits are not assignable, except to the extent
