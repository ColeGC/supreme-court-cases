Court:","start":16.222,"stop":18.575,"duration":2.35},{"text":"This case involves an award of attorney's fees pursuant to Section 706(k) of Title VII in favor of the settling plaintiffs and against a union when that union was not a defendant and intervened only because the settlement agreement would override the union's contract and impair the seniority rights and job security of its members.","start":18.575,"stop":38.388,"duration":19.81},{"text":"Petitioner IFFA is the labor union which represents TWA's flight attendants.","start":38.388,"stop":43.803,"duration":5.41},{"text":"In 1970, the union which formerly represented TWA's flight attendants filed charges in this class action suit challenging TWA's practice of terminating all flight attendants who became mothers.","start":43.803,"stop":54.951,"duration":11.15},{"text":"The class was defined as all flight attendants so terminated from 1965 forward.","start":54.951,"stop":60.624,"duration":5.67},{"text":"Two months later, the union successfully negotiated the elimination of the \"no-mothers\" policy pursuant to a new collective bargaining agreement.","start":60.624,"stop":68.328,"duration":7.7},{"text":"The case was settled in 1971, but the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's approval of that settlement because of a conflict of interest it perceived between the union's obligations to the class members on one hand and its duties to represent the incumbent employees on the other.","start":68.328,"stop":84.961,"duration":16.63},{"text":"And it was those same duties, of course, which brought about IFFA's intervention years later.","start":84.961,"stop":90.186,"duration":5.23},{"text":"But, at that point, in 1973, the union and union counsel were replaced as class representative and class counsel by the parties and counsel who had brought that appeal.","start":90.186,"stop":99.252,"duration":9.07},{"text":"In 1976, the district court held that TWA's policy was indeed illegal and that all plaintiffs had timely claims for the reason that TWA had engaged in the so-called continuing violation.","start":99.252,"stop":111.851,"duration":12.6},{"text":"The Seventh Circuit reversed again in 1978, holding that while the policy was illegal, TWA had not engaged in a continuing violation, and that the claims of 92 percent of the plaintiffs were therefore time-barred.","start":111.851,"stop":125.789,"duration":13.94},{"text":"In response to a secondary argument made by plaintiffs to the effect that TWA had waived its timeliness defense, the Seventh Circuit said that it need not address that issue because the Title VII time limit was a jurisdictional prerequisite which could not be waived.","start":125.789,"stop":140.642,"duration":14.85},{"text":"The plaintiff sought certiorari on the jurisdictional issue only.","start":140.642,"stop":145.093,"duration":4.45},{"text":"TWA cross-petitioned, but consideration of those petitions was deferred when the parties announced yet another settlement.","start":145.093,"stop":151.477,"duration":6.38},{"text":"Pursuant to this new settlement, the class was divided into two subclasses; Subclass A consisting of the approximately 30 women with timely claims, and Subclass B consisting of the approximately 400 women with untimely claims.","start":151.477,"stop":164.865,"duration":13.39},{"text":"TWA was to pay $3 million, one half to each subclass.","start":164.865,"stop":169.72,"duration":4.85},{"text":"Counsel fees were to be deducted from the settlement fund.","start":169.72,"stop":173.002,"duration":3.28},{"text":"Plaintiffs were to be able to regain their jobs and obtain a grant of retroactive competitive seniority from original date of hire through the date the settlement agreement was signed in 1979.","start":173.002,"stop":183.551,"duration":10.55},{"text":"And, last but not least, the settlement agreement specifically purported to supersede prior, current, and future collective bargaining agreements.","start":183.551,"stop":191.925,"duration":8.37},{"text":"At that point, in 1979, IFFA, which had come into existence in 1977, intervened to contest the grant of seniority to the class members because of the effect we believed that seniority would have upon the incumbents.","start":191.925,"stop":205.634,"duration":13.71},{"text":"As part of our arguments, we contended that if in fact there was no subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of Subclass B, as the Seventh Circuit had already held, then the district court had no power to grant seniority to those individuals and override the collective bargaining agreement on behalf of those plaintiffs with jurisdictionally defective claims.","start":205.634,"stop":224.077,"duration":18.44},{"text":"The district court overruled that argument, saying that it need not heed the opinion of the Seventh Circuit finding a lack of jurisdiction for the reason that it was not final.","start":224.077,"stop":232.882,"duration":8.81},{"text":"The Seventh Circuit overruled us for an entirely different reason, holding that a district court need not have subject matter jurisdiction to issue orders pursuant to a settlement agreement.","start":232.882,"stop":244.351,"duration":11.47},{"text":"IFFA petitioned for certiorari, and in March of 1981 our petition was granted on two issues, including the question of whether a district court had power to issue orders pursuant to a settlement agreement in the face of a holding by its court of appeals that jurisdiction was lacking.","start":244.351,"stop":260.733,"duration":16.38},{"text":"At the same time, however, the court granted the petitions of TWA and plaintiffs which had been held in abeyance since 1978.","start":260.733,"stop":268.497,"duration":7.76},{"text":"In the Zipes opinion in 1982, the Court chose not to decide the jurisdictional issue we had framed in No. 80-951 but, instead, decided that the Seventh Circuit had been wrong when it had previously held that the Title VII time limit was a jurisdictional prerequisite which could not under any circumstances be waived.","start":268.497,"stop":288.842,"duration":20.34},{"text":"The Court went on to affirm the orders approving the settlement and granting seniority to the plaintiffs.","start":288.842,"stop":293.265,"duration":4.42},{"text":"Now, the primary reason IFFA had fought the grant of seniority was that it feared that the TWA flight attendant work force was about to enter a period where it would not only not expand but actually significantly shrink.","start":293.265,"stop":306.823,"duration":13.56},{"text":"As it happened, from mid-1979 when the settlement was announced, until mid-1983, TWA furloughed several hundred flight attendants and hired none.","start":306.823,"stop":318.72,"duration":11.9},{"text":"When expansion finally came, those openings went not to the incumbent furloughees, but to the plaintiffs because of the seniority granted to them.","start":318.72,"stop":327.867,"duration":9.15},{"text":"The reentry of hundreds of plaintiffs into the work force blocked the recall of 159 furloughees who eventually dropped off the employment rolls due to a five-year contractual limitation on furlough status.","start":327.867,"stop":341.407,"duration":13.54},{"text":"And, finally, we get to the subject of attorney's fees.","start":341.407,"stop":345.518,"duration":4.11},{"text":"In 1982 plaintiff's counsel sought and were awarded nearly $1.4 million from the $3 million settlement fund.","start":345.518,"stop":354.614,"duration":9.1},{"text":"Of that amount, $1,250,000 was paid for pre-settlement work at a multiplier of two.","start":354.614,"stop":361.519,"duration":6.91},{"text":"Meanwhile, the typical Subclass B member who had been away from her job as a flight attendant for 13 to 18 years, received approximately $2,000 in back pay.","start":361.519,"stop":371.917,"duration":10.4},{"text":"Counsel also sought fees against TWA and IFFA for the litigation in regard to the settlement, and in 1986 the district court denied the request for further fees against TWA, holding that plaintiffs had waived any further fees from TWA in the settlement agreement.","start":371.917,"stop":387.809,"duration":15.89},{"text":"However, the district court assessed fees against IFFA in an amount exceeding $180,000 because, in the view of the district court, prevailing plaintiffs are almost automatically entitled to an award of attorney's fees.","start":387.809,"stop":400.787,"duration":12.98},{"text":"Last year, a divided Seventh Circuit panel affirmed.","start":400.787,"stop":403.411,"duration":2.62},{"text":"All of this Court's decisions regarding civil rights attorney's fees from Piggle Park, to Christiansburg, to Garland last month, make it clear that equitable considerations are paramount.","start":403.411,"stop":417.18,"duration":13.77},{"text":"As Justice Stewart said in Christiansburg, 706(k) does not even invite, much less require, a mechanical construction.","start":417.18,"stop":424.794,"duration":7.61},{"text":"Accordingly, we believe it appropriate to consider the very difficult, perhaps nearly impossible, quandary which IFFA faced when it intervened in 1979.","start":424.794,"stop":434.461,"duration":9.67},{"text":"And that dilemma was brought about not just by the facts I've outlined, but also by the changing state of the law, as best demonstrated by the then very recent decisions of this Court in the Franks case in 1976 and the Teamsters case in 1977.","start":434.461,"stop":451.39,"duration":16.93},{"text":"In Franks, the Court held that successful Title VII plaintiffs are ordinarily entitled to a grant of retroactive competitive seniority unless that seniority will have unusual adverse impact upon the incumbents.","start":451.39,"stop":465.82,"duration":14.43},{"text":"Now, Franks gave us some problems.","start":465.82,"stop":468.902,"duration":3.08},{"text":"First, Franks was decided against the background of a final determination of liability.","start":468.902,"stop":474.836,"duration":5.93},{"text":"The timeliness and violation issues had been finally determined in favor of plaintiff's, as emphasized in Justice Steven's opinion in the Evans case the next year.","start":474.836,"stop":483.614,"duration":8.78},{"text":"So, arguably, the Franks standard did not even apply to our situation.","start":483.614,"stop":486.694,"duration":3.08},{"text":"Second problem.","start":486.694,"stop":488.607,"duration":1.91},{"text":"What is unusual adverse impact?","start":488.607,"stop":490.927,"duration":2.32},{"text":"Well, we thought the seniority would affect peoples' ability to hold their jobs.","start":490.927,"stop":495.652,"duration":4.72},{"text":"Surely, that is adverse.","start":495.652,"stop":497.061,"duration":1.41},{"text":"Arguably, it is the most adverse affect an employee can feel in a Title VII case.","start":497.061,"stop":501.205,"duration":4.14},{"text":"Is it unusual?","start":501.205,"stop":502.817,"duration":1.61},{"text":"We would certainly hope so.","start":502.817,"stop":504.217,"duration":1.4},{"text":"And, thus, we thought we could meet the Franks standard even if it applied.","start":504.217,"stop":507.74,"duration":3.52},{"text":"But our third problem was the most difficult.","start":507.74,"stop":509.563,"duration":1.82},{"text":"How do you prove it?","start":509.563,"stop":511.333,"duration":1.77},{"text":"The standard requires the union or the incumbent employees to present evidence looking forward, evidence which is necessarily speculative and conjectural.","start":511.333,"stop":519.089,"duration":7.76},{"text":"And, in retrospect, I must say that no one took our speculation seriously.","start":519.089,"stop":525.083,"duration":5.99},{"text":"In fact, the Seventh Circuit, one year after IFFA's intervention, despite the fact that during that year TWA had furloughed hundreds of flight attendants and hired none... a fact of which the court was aware... overruled our arguments in significant part in reliance upon previous testimony before the district court to the effect that this settlement is no problem, it will not affect the incumbents, as a result of normal expansion and attrition, we can absorb all of these class members in less than one-half year.","start":525.083,"stop":556.154,"duration":31.07},{"text":"Unfortunately, it did not happen.","start":556.154,"stop":559.587,"duration":3.43},{"text":"Looking back, obviously, our arguments have more force than they had looking forward.","start":559.587,"stop":566.41,"duration":6.82},{"text":"To use the language in Christiansburg, although we may have presented facts that appeared questionable or unfavorable at the outset, clearly IFFA had an entirely reasonable ground for bringing its claims.","start":566.41,"stop":578.387,"duration":11.98},{"text":"This, alone, provides a strong equitable reason for denying fees.","start":578.387,"stop":581.91,"duration":3.52}]},{"speakerName":"Sandra Day O'Connor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Fehr, does it make any difference under your equitable theory if an intervenor

that be a consideration in the ultimate award of fees?","start":598.273,"stop":601.766,"duration":3.49}]},{"speakerName":"Steven A.
