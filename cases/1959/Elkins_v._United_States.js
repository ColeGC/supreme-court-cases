federal court.","start":102.344,"stop":119.314,"duration":16.97},{"text":"That was an additional ground which we submit all of the evidence was fully developed in the trial court and the Circuit Court

consideration, the situation which confronted the federal officers at the time of the state seizures.","start":128.761,"stop":138.816,"duration":10.06},{"text":"The FBI agent testified that he learned of these seizures by reading the newspapers, the following morning.","start":138.816,"stop":145.79,"duration":6.97},{"text":"Portions of the tapes were printed in the newspapers.","start":145.79,"stop":148.982,"duration":3.19},{"text":"It was apparent that if all of the accounts were true, there existed a federal violation.","start":148.982,"stop":154.598,"duration":5.62},{"text":"Following up this information coming to him, he went over to the state officers and he listened to some -- to one of the tapes that

Attorney was aware of this possible federal violation.","start":168.236,"stop":173.743,"duration":5.51},{"text":"Now, the federal agent had heard a knock on that one tape and he had seen the notes accompanying the tape indicating a synopsis of the tape, the names of the parties to the conversations, and year at that time or later, the FBI agent talked to one of the parties Langley and learned that he had not given any consent to the interception of these messages.","start":173.743,"stop":197.959,"duration":24.22},{"text":"Now, on the basis of that, it was public knowledge, and that there was a federal violation.And it was knowledge which the U.S. Attorney and the FBI agents have.","start":197.959,"stop":207.852,"duration":9.89},{"text":"So the tapes wound up in a state of

existing.","start":218.271,"stop":219.482,"duration":1.21},{"text":"And on that basis, the FBI agent went to the state authorities and asked permission again to listen to the tapes which he did on August the 13th, 1956.","start":219.482,"stop":229.153,"duration":9.67},{"text":"Following a complete audit of the tapes on which he testified, he could tell because of the background noises of the conversation and of the wire noises that they were intercepts, they were not recordings made outside of the telephone system, he then sworn out a federal warrant, and on that basis, on September the 5th, secured the tapes from the custody of the State.","start":229.153,"stop":257.289,"duration":28.14},{"text":"That warrant, I think, is unquestionably based on personal knowledge of the agent, it

to.","start":378.852,"stop":379.812,"duration":0.96},{"text":"This is a clear case of complete innocence on the Federal Government's part.","start":379.812,"stop":384.98,"duration":5.17},{"text":"I think the testimony is that before any communication from Schrunk or anybody else in the state side, the FBI agents had seen the testimony or seen the report of the raid in the newspapers and were discussing it in their office, as to whether or not a federal violation was involved.","start":384.98,"stop":403.153,"duration":18.17},{"text":"And as I was about to say, one of the state authorities, it may have Langley wrote a letter to the Attorney General of Oregon and to the federal authorities and to someone else to the telephone company notifying them of the seizure of these tapes which indicated interceptions in violation of both state and federal law.","start":403.153,"stop":424.108,"duration":20.95},{"text":"I do not wish to overstate my case here because it's a good one without any elaboration or whatever, but here -- this is a situation confronting the federal authorities.","start":424.108,"stop":437.09,"duration":12.98},{"text":"And in -- as Mr. Justice Whittaker pointed out yesterday in a question, would the bungling or purposeful misuse of process by a state court forever bar the Federal Government?","start":437.09,"stop":449.056,"duration":11.97},{"text":"Now here, the petitioner Elkins has accused District Attorney Langley of purposefully misusing state process.","start":449.056,"stop":456.995,"duration":7.94},{"text":"I make no brief for one side or another in this power struggle between these people in Oregon.","start":456.995,"stop":462.575,"duration":5.58},{"text":"But if that is true, if there was a purposeful misuse of process here, abuse of process by the State District Attorney, should that forever bar the Federal Government from prosecuting an apparent federal violation here?","start":462.575,"stop":478.059,"duration":15.48},{"text":"We submit that the Federal Government proceeded in the only way that it could have, that is, it got out a warrant and it went to the place where the tapes where, and it took the tapes under that warrant and then proceeded to present the evidence to a federal grand jury.","start":478.059,"stop":497.938,"duration":19.88},{"text":"I -- the -- because of the nature of the state court's rulings, these tapes were in a sort of limbo.","start":497.938,"stop":506.015,"duration":8.08},{"text":"They were instruments of crime under both Oregon and federal law, able decided yesterday, they were the fruits of crime, they could not be returned to the petitioners Elkins and Clark.","start":506.015,"stop":519.794,"duration":13.78},{"text":"They were going to be held in state custody, and so the United States proceeded in the only way it could.","start":519.794,"stop":526.258,"duration":6.46},{"text":"Now, I'm reminded of Mr. Justice Frankfurter's comment yesterday that this -- that this action took place by people who were not in the same household.","start":526.258,"stop":535.658,"duration":9.4},{"text":"And that is very clear on this record.","start":535.658,"stop":537.91,"duration":2.25},{"text":"The federal authorities were not in the same household with the state people.","start":537.91,"stop":542.615,"duration":4.71},{"text":"And I'm reminded of Mr. Justice Holmes remarks in the Silverthorne case, where it -- where he said for the Court that if knowledge of them, the facts, is gained from an independent source, they maybe proved like any others, but the knowledge gained by the Government's own wrong cannot be used by it.","start":542.615,"stop":562.719,"duration":20.1},{"text":"Here, there is no own wrong by the Government in any way.","start":562.719,"stop":567.108,"duration":4.39},{"text":"And here, we have to take the situation as it is and proceed in accordance with the due process of a federal court.","start":567.108,"stop":574.647,"duration":7.54},{"text":"We submit that on the facts which came out yesterday in argument and on the facts which I'll go into later, that on a situation like this, the wisdom, the policy of wisdom is to allow the Federal District Judge free and unfeathered choice of the evidence not being bound by any actions which may have been taken place either by state police officers or by rulings of the state judiciary.","start":574.647,"stop":601.701,"duration":27.05},{"text":"This is, as I will develop later, an example of attempted frustration of federal process merely by an abuse of state judicial process.","start":601.701,"stop":611.017,"duration":9.32},{"text":"And I think that these facts provide the strongest practical argument for not applying a rigid exclusionary rule.","start":611.017,"stop":618.126,"duration":7.11},{"text":"On a rational of the Abatte decision, written for the Court by Mr. Justice Brennan, stated that the basic -- this dealt of course with double jeopardy, but the reasoning here on the Fifth and Fourth Amendments, I think, the reasoning is close and similar.","start":618.126,"stop":633.783,"duration":15.66},{"text":"The basic dilemma was recognized over a century ago in Fox versus Ohio as it was there pointed out, if the States are free to prosecute criminal acts violating their laws and a result on state prosecution to bar federal prosecutions based on the same acts, federal law enforcement must necessarily be hindered.","start":633.783,"stop":655.496,"duration":21.71},{"text":"And again, Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Feldman case, the Government here is not seeking to benefit by evidence which it extorted.","start":655.496,"stop":664.361,"duration":8.87},{"text":"And that's certainly true here and in the later -- in the opinion for the Court.","start":664.361,"stop":668.364,"duration":4},{"text":"Otherwise, the criminal law of the United States would be at the hazard of carelessness or connivance in some petty civil litigation in any state court, quite beyond the reach of the most alert watchfulness by the law officers of the Government.","start":668.364,"stop":684.078,"duration":15.71},{"text":"Now, I'm reminded of the fact that in the Abatte opinion, in Footnote 7, in citing Courts of Appeals cases where the state prosecution did not bar subsequent federal prosecution.","start":684.078,"stop":695.946,"duration":11.87},{"text":"This Court, through Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion, first cited the Rios case, which is set for argument immediately following this one.","start":695.946,"stop":703.545,"duration":7.6},{"text":"Now, in Rios, we had a situation in which there was a seizure which was ruled illegal by the state courts.","start":703.545,"stop":710.828,"duration":7.28},{"text":"That, in the state trial under state procedure resulted in an acquittal without any possibility of appeal by the State.","start":710.828,"stop":720.415,"duration":9.59},{"text":"Now, then on -- on the Abatte case, the Federal Government would be free to prosecute without any question of jeopardy arising.","start":720.415,"stop":727.739,"duration":7.32},{"text":"And here we have in Rios, a situation where the question is not under the Fifth Amendment but the question involves the same identical package of narcotics under the question of search and seizure.","start":727.739,"stop":739.054,"duration":11.31},{"text":"And so I submit that the logic, the same logic that applies to one applies to another that the Federal Government should not be barred in its use of the evidence obtained by the acts of state officers anymore under the Fourth Amendment than it would be barred by a state court acquittal based on the suppression of the evidence under the Fifth.","start":739.054,"stop":762.318,"duration":23.26},{"text":"I think the reasoning is parallel.","start":762.318,"stop":765.924,"duration":3.61},{"text":"Now, in -- it's been referred to in the petitioners' brief about the conviction of the District Attorney Langley here on a misdemeanor charge and his removal from office.","start":765.924,"stop":779.857,"duration":13.93},{"text":"Again, I emphasize the Federal Government here nowise has taken any sides in the struggle in Oregon.","start":779.857,"stop":786.086,"duration":6.23},{"text":"And we think the wisdom is manifested.","start":786.086,"stop":788.127,"duration":2.04},{"text":"But I want to call to the Court the opinion in State versus Langley, cited by petitioner in 323 Pacific and give you the circumstance of that conviction.","start":788.127,"stop":798.777,"duration":10.65},{"text":"Incidentally, in addition to the indictment and conviction of Langley, there was the indictment of seven other federal witnesses, four of them state officers who appeared and testified in federal courts, those indictments in coming -- coming just before or during the federal hearing on the motion to suppress and some of them being introduced in the record in this case for purposes of impeachment.","start":798.777,"stop":820.432,"duration":21.65},{"text":"Nine of those other indictments resulted in a conviction.","start":820.432,"stop":823.55,"duration":3.12},{"text":"Only one, I think, went to trial.","start":823.55,"stop":825.139,"duration":1.59},{"text":"There was an acquittal, all the rest were dismissed.","start":825.139,"stop":827.867,"duration":2.73},{"text":"But now, as to Mr. Langley's conviction on a misdemeanor charge, that misdemeanor indictment was returned 10 days after the federal indictment in Elkins.","start":827.867,"stop":838.511,"duration":10.64},{"text":"Secondly, Langley state trial in all of these facts are from the opinion in the Pacific reporter.","start":838.511,"stop":845.106,"duration":6.6},{"text":"Langley state trial began April the 9th, 1957, the very same day that Elkins motion to suppress evidence came on for hearing in the U.S. court.","start":845.106,"stop":855.342,"duration":10.24},{"text":"Thirdly, while waiting in the state judges chambers for the trial, during a recess, Langley was arrested on two new state indictments.","start":855.342,"stop":866.089,"duration":10.75},{"text":"Fourthly, at same day, there were five column and eight column headlines in the Portland newspapers telling of the District Attorney's arrest while on the very day, he went to trial in the misdemeanor case on which he was convicted.","start":866.089,"stop":881.197,"duration":15.11},{"text":"Fifthly, television cameras were in the judges' chambers, photographed the arrest of Langley, and they were shown on three news programs that night, the day he went to trial.","start":881.197,"stop":891.727,"duration":10.53},{"text":"Sixthly, cameramen permitted -- were permitted to take pictures from within the courtroom railing during the testimony of petitioner Elkins against Langley contrary to Rule 69 of the state court rules.","start":891.727,"stop":905.532,"duration":13.81},{"text":"Seventhly, a photographer was permitted to stand beside the jury box to take 25 still picture of Langley's defense counsel during his closing argument.","start":905.532,"stop":916.469,"duration":10.94},{"text":"Eighthly, the trial judge presiding in this trial was the same circuit judge who ruled that the seizure of these tapes of illegal and turn the tapes over to the State Attorney General.","start":916.469,"stop":929.694,"duration":13.22},{"text":"Now, that was the way which Mr. Langley was convicted.","start":929.694,"stop":932.979,"duration":3.29},{"text":"I will add that this was a state trial of course.","start":932.979,"stop":935.795,"duration":2.82},{"text":"It was affirmed by the Oregon Supreme Court.","start":935.795,"stop":938.05,"duration":2.25},{"text":"Certiorari was sought and denied by this Court, which I take it merely means that for -- there were no federal question involved or there are more important cases demanding the Court's attention and in nowise, it constituted a ruling

not having any exclusionary rule in the federal courts when there -- a hassle is going on between state officers and state courts, and that there are definite abuses of the state judicial process in that course because if the Federal Government is in anyway bound or determined by the illegality of any action as a judge in the state courts or if the state law is held to be determinative in the

result.","start":1009.124,"stop":1034.905,"duration":25.78},{"text":"Now, isn't that as much of a horrible as the one that you -- you profess to us here and wouldn't that lead to an opposite
