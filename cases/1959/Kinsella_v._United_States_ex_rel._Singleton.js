applied.","start":120.814,"stop":135.62,"duration":14.81},{"text":"Now this case, of course is like the case – like the two cases before this Court in Covert and Krueger in that involved the dependents, persons accompanying the armed forces except for this fact that here a noncapital rather than the capital offense is involved.","start":135.62,"stop":154.871,"duration":19.25},{"text":"And the problem here is whether this difference, this distinction should make for a difference in the result.","start":154.871,"stop":161.608,"duration":6.74},{"text":"The problem can really be broken down in two questions first, where the capital and noncapital distinction can be relevant at all for jurisdictional purposes, and secondly, if it can be relevant whether it should be decisive to the

offense.","start":181.125,"stop":191.89,"duration":10.76},{"text":"Well, that may well be true as a general matter, although it isn't entirely in all cases.","start":191.89,"stop":196.845,"duration":4.96},{"text":"For example, the military for many years from 1863 to 1916 had jurisdiction over common law offenses other than capital offenses, did not -- did not have jurisdiction over capital offenses even the time of war until 1916.","start":196.845,"stop":212.782,"duration":15.94},{"text":"It certainly is true in this situation and that is for these reasons.","start":212.782,"stop":221.294,"duration":8.51},{"text":"The problem of course here is a constitutional one.","start":221.294,"stop":224.776,"duration":3.48},{"text":"Now, the capital and noncapital distinction has relevance and has been held by the Court to have relevance in other types of constitutional cases and I'm specifically I'm referring to due process cases.","start":224.776,"stop":237.504,"duration":12.73},{"text":"In our view, the problem that is here involved is essentially similar to a due process type of problem, and the techniques and the approach of the due process determination should be used and this arises essentially out of the fact that the offense was committed overseas outside of the jurisdiction of the United States proper.","start":237.504,"stop":259.612,"duration":22.11},{"text":"Now, we recognize that In re Ross and the Insular Cases which this Court discussed at length both in the first Covert opinion and in the second Covert case, cannot be read to put the proposition that the Constitution cannot in any event have any application abroad.","start":259.612,"stop":281.049,"duration":21.44},{"text":"But I think those cases do stand for the proposition that the circumstances of a particular case, the practicalities and the necessities do have relevance in determining whether any particular power, any particular provision does apply when the problem arises outside of the United States proper.","start":281.049,"stop":303.788,"duration":22.74},{"text":"For example, in the Ross case itself it was deemed relevant that the -- it was -- it appeared necessary for the protection of Americans of Counselor Courts be established.","start":303.788,"stop":315.055,"duration":11.27},{"text":"I'm not saying at the Ross case without more just because this was held to be true in the Ross case that therefore we could establish Counselor Courts or similar type of Courts in this situation, but it does stand for the proposition and -- as far as we can determine and has not been overruled, it does stand for the proposition that in particular circumstances, various factors such as practicalities and necessities do have a bearing on the scope and the breadth of various constitutional provisions and policies.","start":315.055,"stop":351.761,"duration":36.71},{"text":"The same would be true of the Insular Cases.","start":351.761,"stop":354.173,"duration":2.41},{"text":"The Court there held in these various cases that -- that, for example, jury trials need not be provided in Criminal Cases in the Philippines or in Hawaii and Puerto Rico and so on because it was said that the traditions and institutions in those territories didn't lend themselves to that type of procedural device.","start":354.173,"stop":376.303,"duration":22.13},{"text":"And again, while we're not arguing if this has to be carried over as such into these cases, it does show that the approach is essentially one of determining each situation on its particular facts and on the circumstances as they arise.","start":376.303,"stop":396.014,"duration":19.71},{"text":"So, the basic conclusion that can be drawn from those decisions is that -- that practical matters, circumstances of the era, circumstances of -- of the -- the power that can be exercised properly in the particular -- in the particular country at a particular time, do have relevance to the scope of -- of constitutional powers and constitutional provisions and guarantees generally abroad.","start":396.014,"stop":424.596,"duration":28.58},{"text":"Now, that's true generally and then I suppose assuming that the conditions here are present for the same -- in the same way that -- that would come to the conclusion would it be relevant in this situation as well.","start":424.596,"stop":440.653,"duration":16.06},{"text":"Now, the -- that -- that type of an issue as to whether the practicalities of the situation demand and the circumstances at least are relevant to determining the scope of powers is best and can really only be determined and -- and decided by a due process type of approach.","start":440.653,"stop":462.306,"duration":21.65},{"text":"On the one hand, the interests of the various parties have to be considered, on the other hand, the practicalities and necessities of the situation and that type of an approach, traditionally, the capital, noncapital distinction has been irrelevant factor.","start":462.306,"stop":480.039,"duration":17.73},{"text":"I might say too that the same conclusion can be reached irrespective really of Ross or the Insular Cases simply on the -- on the problem of the content of Clause 14 itself, the clause which permits Congress to provide for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.","start":480.039,"stop":499.976,"duration":19.94},{"text":"As was indicated, as -- as we quote in our brief from Alexander Hamilton from The Federalist, he had the view that the circumstances and necessities are relevant to the -- to the determination of the scope of this Clause 14 power.","start":499.976,"stop":515.732,"duration":15.76},{"text":"Now, we don't mean to say that the Clause 14 power can be expanded at will, at the expense as it's suggested by our opponents at the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, but we do suggest that the -- the circumstances are appropriate in any -- in any given case to determine how far the power extends.","start":515.732,"stop":537.075,"duration":21.34},{"text":"For example, as we read the history, the power does extend -- did extend in frontier type situations where there were no civil courts.","start":537.075,"stop":547.717,"duration":10.64},{"text":"The power does extend and did extend in war time for civilians as -- as some of the cases hold.","start":547.717,"stop":555,"duration":7.28},{"text":"So, it -- it seems to us that if those types of considerations can give content to the power and have given content to the power, then in this situation too, these -- these same considerations maybe considered and maybe relevant to determine what the content of the power is.","start":555,"stop":576.723,"duration":21.72},{"text":"We contend of course that in a -- in a – certainly in the general way, the situation we have here overseas is analogous to the types of situations that were confronted by the British Parliament when the -- the Articles of War 1765 were passed when -- when they were talking about giving Court Martial Jurisdiction over persons who were in places where the -- where our civil judicature as it is said in the -- in the article is absent.","start":576.723,"stop":609.211,"duration":32.49},{"text":"He -- our the civil judicature is absent as the same way as it was in Gibraltar or in Annapolis in -- at time when those articles were first enacted.","start":609.211,"stop":622.164,"duration":12.95},{"text":"Now, assuming that it is capital, noncapital, distinction can be relevant across the problem still is whether the -- whether that distinction should have a decisive impact on the case so as to cause a result that's different from that was reached in Covert and we think that it does.","start":622.164,"stop":640.518,"duration":18.35},{"text":"It has that impact and does have that significance.","start":640.518,"stop":644.265,"duration":3.75},{"text":"In two respects, one that might be called that has negative and the other positive and negative aspect is simply the fact that here, the very important consideration that -- that was so much discussed in the Covert opinions and concurring opinions, certainly, that life was at stake and that the -- the death was irrevocable.","start":644.265,"stop":669.128,"duration":24.86},{"text":"That factor is simply absent here.","start":669.128,"stop":671.347,"duration":2.22},{"text":"That type of the factor which many times in the past has led the Court to make a sharp distinction between one type of process that may -- maybe that do appropriate in one type of situation.","start":671.347,"stop":685.344,"duration":14},{"text":"It has led the Court to hold that the same type of process need not be given, where noncapital cases involve.","start":685.344,"stop":693.919,"duration":8.57},{"text":"But beyond that merely negative factor of the absence of the -- of the capital nature of the case, there is also a positive factor and that has to do with the alternatives that are available to the exercise of Court Martial Jurisdiction.","start":693.919,"stop":710.918,"duration":17},{"text":"Briefly, it's our view that the only real alternative to the exercise of Court Martial Jurisdiction is also attractive and palatable and desirable from the overall American interest not only of the American government but also of this -- of the persons involved themselves is a trial in this country.","start":710.918,"stop":731.637,"duration":20.72},{"text":"And that I think was the rationale in which the decision -- the ultimate decision in Convert can be explained.","start":731.637,"stop":738.712,"duration":7.08},{"text":"In other words, it was possible to bring back to transport the few persons involved in capital cases back to this country for a trial.","start":738.712,"stop":750.347,"duration":11.63},{"text":"The -- It warranted and -- and physically and practically possible, but I think it's not realistic or practical to expect the same kind of approach in the many noncapital cases that are committed at all times overseas by the -- almost half a million persons who make up this contingent that these cases are concerned with.","start":750.347,"stop":778.473,"duration":28.13},{"text":"For -- for these minor offenses, it would simply not be one that the said in motion, the elaborate apparatus that would be necessary to bring about a trial in the United States.","start":778.473,"stop":789.54,"duration":11.07},{"text":"For example, the problem of witnesses alone would be a -- a staggering problem.","start":789.54,"stop":796.639,"duration":7.1},{"text":"The -- some of the witnesses might be local police officials.","start":796.639,"stop":800.439,"duration":3.8},{"text":"You
