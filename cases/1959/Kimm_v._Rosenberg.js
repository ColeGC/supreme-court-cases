it.","start":344.511,"stop":349.595,"duration":5.08},{"text":"That is reinforced in the present case by the contrast and the text between the preconditions which the alien must prove and has the burden of proving, and the different way in which exceptions were carved out by Section 19 (d).","start":349.595,"stop":366.194,"duration":16.6},{"text":"Furthermore, if the alien has a burden of proving that he is not within the exception on 19 (d), then, then he has unreasonable burden of proving not only a negative, but a whole host of negatives.","start":366.194,"stop":380.54,"duration":14.35},{"text":"He has prove not only that he's not or never was a member of the Communist Party, he also has the burden of proving that he was not an anarchist, that he was not a dope kind of smuggler and so forth.","start":380.54,"stop":393.189,"duration":12.65},{"text":"Now, the fact is that it is not reasonable to suppose that Congress intended that the applicability of Section 19 (c) would be a triable issue in the suspension hearing as distinguished from the deportation hearing.","start":393.189,"stop":412.687,"duration":19.5},{"text":"I suggest that Congress assume that if an alien were in fact within one of the deportable classes referred to in Section 19 (d), that would have been an issue which would have been charged and proved against them in the deportation preceding problem.","start":412.687,"stop":434.152,"duration":21.46},{"text":"And Congress just did not seem to have in mind the possibility that the alien might have been charged in the deportation proceeding with one cause for deportation but of course not with in 19 (d), but that he might also be subject to deportation for another uncharged cause, which was within Section 19 (d).","start":434.152,"stop":458.758,"duration":24.61},{"text":"Maybe it wasn't charged because it was not known to the service, maybe it wasn't charged because the service couldn't carry the burden of proof.","start":458.758,"stop":465.654,"duration":6.9},{"text":"But I think all Congress had in mind was at Section 19 (d) would automatically preclude or even holding suspension hearings in cases where the charge for deportation was a -- a cause such as anarchism, Communism and so -- prostitution, of course, listed in 19 (d).","start":465.654,"stop":488.742,"duration":23.09},{"text":"Otherwise, if you assume as the Court of Appeals did that the alien must prove in the suspension proceeding that he is not deportable, on the various grounds referred to in Section 19 (d), you get what is virtually an impossible situation.","start":488.742,"stop":509.319,"duration":20.58},{"text":"Consideration of a suspension application becomes necessary only after the alien is found deportable.","start":509.319,"stop":517.649,"duration":8.33},{"text":"The suspension hearing is only ancillary to the deportation hearing.","start":517.649,"stop":522.476,"duration":4.83},{"text":"Under the Court of Appeals theory, the ancillary deportation hearing, the ancillary hearing, the suspension hearing has to become a kind of second deportation hearing.","start":522.476,"stop":534.892,"duration":12.42},{"text":"And in the second deportation hearing, you have to determine with the burden of proof on the alien that the alien is not deportable on some ground additional to that already charged and found against them.","start":534.892,"stop":551.601,"duration":16.71},{"text":"Well, I just don't think that Congress so intended it and it -- it somewhat is an unworkable system and I think therefore, it is fair to conclude that the alien does not have the burden of disproving 19

-- I think the regulation is ambiguous because I am not sure whether they represent the regulation to condition -- to the burden of proving eligibility.","start":585.031,"stop":597.041,"duration":12.01},{"text":"It also means the burden of disproving disqualification under 19 (d) as distinguished from proving a -- a conformance to the eligibility conditions, preconditions of 19 (c).","start":597.041,"stop":612.081,"duration":15.04},{"text":"If the regulation is broad enough, to put on the alien the burden of disproving 19 (d), then, I say that is invalid because it is not justified by the statute.","start":612.081,"stop":627.346,"duration":15.26},{"text":"Now, let me go to the third reason.","start":627.346,"stop":629.779,"duration":2.43},{"text":"And this is the reason that is at least principally and perhaps solely briefed by the Government, and that was advanced by the Board of Immigration Appeals.","start":629.779,"stop":641.524,"duration":11.75},{"text":"The reason -- this reason goes as follows.","start":641.524,"stop":645.124,"duration":3.6},{"text":"They say the questions answered of the petitioner were pertinent questions and were proper for the Attorney General to answer, because after all were proper for the Attorney General to ask because after all, if -- if the alien in fact gave an affirmative answer, then he wouldn't -- he would be disqualified.","start":645.124,"stop":670.011,"duration":24.89},{"text":"Now, they say after all the Attorney General had a right to ask the questions they were pertinent, not only that, but the alien is seeking a favor.","start":670.011,"stop":679.204,"duration":9.19},{"text":"Therefore, the petitioner had a duty to answer the questions.","start":679.204,"stop":685.146,"duration":5.94},{"text":"By refusing to answer he breached the duty and this made him ineligible eligible for suspension.","start":685.146,"stop":691.982,"duration":6.84},{"text":"And I think that is a fair summary of the argument of the argument of the -- made by the Board of Immigration Appeals and by the Government's brief.","start":691.982,"stop":701.538,"duration":9.56},{"text":"And the shorter it is that the Board of Immigration rule, Board of Immigration Appeals Rule, that is to say condition to eligibility that the alien answer questions of the Attorney General if those questions are pertinent to Section 19 (d).","start":701.538,"stop":723.377,"duration":21.84},{"text":"Now, I think this reason is wrong in the first place because it creates a condition, a requirement for suspension eligibility that is not provided by the statute and that goes beyond the conditions that are provided by the statute.","start":723.377,"stop":741.993,"duration":18.62},{"text":"Congress provided certain specific conditions before an alien could be eligible for suspension.","start":741.993,"stop":750.348,"duration":8.35},{"text":"It also spelled out the disqualifying exceptions of 19 (d).","start":750.348,"stop":756.916,"duration":6.57},{"text":"Now, Congress did not spell out the discretionary factors which the Attorney General could take into account once the alien was found eligible.","start":756.916,"stop":767.445,"duration":10.53},{"text":"But what we're talking about now is eligibility, because petitioner was found ineligible and the Board of Immigration Appeals found that the Attorney General could not exercise his discretion.","start":767.445,"stop":783.982,"duration":16.54},{"text":"Now, the fact is that although the statute specifies the conditions for eligibility, and although it specifies the disqualifying factor of alien deportable under 19 (d), it does not say that one of these conditions is if the alien answered questions of the Attorney General or that he cooperate with the Attorney General.","start":783.982,"stop":809.317,"duration":25.34}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"The Congress defined the procedure

I don't think that as part of his right to investigate and ascertain, he had the right to put substantive and important conditions on eligibility which are in addition to those required by the statute.","start":832.937,"stop":855.43,"duration":22.49}]},{"speakerName":"Felix Frankfurter","textObjs":[{"text":"He didn't do

a moment.","start":867.653,"stop":879.522,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Now, nor does the statute say that a refusal to answer the questions of the Attorney General, or a refusal to cooperate with the

Attorney General to inquire whether the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party body, and assuming that the questions were pertinent, it doesn't follow that the petitioner had a duty to answer

considered.","start":895.822,"stop":920.544,"duration":24.72},{"text":"On the contrary, even if a general obligation to cooperate were read into the statute and if something that has to be read in to
