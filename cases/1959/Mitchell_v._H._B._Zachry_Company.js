apply.","start":108.526,"stop":113.226,"duration":4.7},{"text":"But they also say that if -- if this were a case where the water -- the dam and reservoir were being constructed solely or primarily for interstate producers and interstate instrumentalities, then they concede that there would be a forceful case for holding that the employees here were closely related and directly essential to production of goods by the producers within the area.","start":113.226,"stop":146.073,"duration":32.85},{"text":"Their argument turns largely, if not entirely, on their construction of the amendment to the production coverage of the Act in 1949.","start":146.073,"stop":159.156,"duration":13.08},{"text":"And respondent like the Court of Appeals below doesn't spend much time on the other grounds on which the District Court upheld coverage the Alstate ground.","start":159.156,"stop":171.066,"duration":11.91},{"text":"The Court of Appeals dismissed that as -- said -- assumed that the Government wasn't relying on it mistakenly and their only comment was that the employees here certainly weren't producing any goods for commerce when they were construction the dam that they were -- they were simply producing the dam.","start":171.066,"stop":194.261,"duration":23.19},{"text":"Our -- our answer to that is that this is the way you produce waters to construct the dam.","start":194.261,"stop":199.817,"duration":5.56},{"text":"It's an engineering fact that you produce water by constructing a dam and a

Act, actual producing it's -- is like you drill -- drill wells for oil or you mine -- dig and mine for coal and that this is as much producing water as the mining of coal is producing coal of a digging -- drilling of oil wells is producing oil so that the -- we don't need to minimize that ground of coverage when we direct most of our brief in answering the arguments of the Court of Appeals and respondents.","start":207.441,"stop":249.338,"duration":41.9},{"text":"They do not give any answer to that and that is still, we think, a -- a sufficient basis of coverage.","start":249.338,"stop":258.613,"duration":9.28},{"text":"Coming though to there -- in -- to the interpretation of the legislative history of the 1949 amendment to production, the Court of Appeals said that it didn't have to look to the legislative history to decide that Congress intended to expand the local enterprises that it was removing from the Act and it obviously assumed that what it did was to extract a part of the reasoning from this Court's office building case in Callus and relating to the performing activities of -- of rendering services for a miscellany of customers.","start":258.613,"stop":309.948,"duration":51.33},{"text":"And relying heavily on -- on that reference to Callus, the Court said that this type of service to a miscellany of customers was intended to be excluded as local enterprise.","start":309.948,"stop":328.216,"duration":18.27},{"text":"And this, in effect, is respondents' argument as I think is evident from their -- from their admission that if -- if this facility was designed primarily as solely deserved interstate producers and interstate instrumentalities, then it could forcefully be contended that the employees were covered as closely related and directly essential.","start":328.216,"stop":354.866,"duration":26.65},{"text":"Both the Court of Appeals and respondents' argument rest on the assumption that it was a legislative intent in 1949 to very substantially curtail the scope of coverage.","start":354.866,"stop":372.221,"duration":17.36},{"text":"They -- respondents said so in so many words.","start":372.221,"stop":377.673,"duration":5.45},{"text":"Now, he -- respondent does look to some of the legislative history just the House Report and only parts of the House

history.","start":387.44,"stop":394.097,"duration":6.66},{"text":"Respondents, however, interpret what legislative history they looked at in the same way that apparently the court below interpreted it.","start":394.097,"stop":407.159,"duration":13.06},{"text":"And I did want to say a word in answer to the Court of Appeals reliance on the new construction doctrine since the Court clearly relied pretty heavily on it.","start":407.159,"stop":418.924,"duration":11.76},{"text":"It was the only basis on which it differed from the Eighth Circuit in the Chambers case, where the Eighth Circuit had pointed out that the Vollmer decision didn't establish anything new, it was just asserting the principle that had applied generally to the Act's coverage, and that this type of improvement are enlargement of an existing facility.","start":418.924,"stop":447.112,"duration":28.19},{"text":"It had always been ruled within the coverage of the Act.","start":447.112,"stop":452.893,"duration":5.78},{"text":"That original construction which had previously been thought to be by some outside the scope of that -- of the Act in which the administrator had earlier thought might be a basis for determining coverage on this Act meant something quite different from improvement and enlargement or expansion.","start":452.893,"stop":476.072,"duration":23.18},{"text":"Now, the Fifth Circuit obviously treated this as new construction.","start":476.072,"stop":479.708,"duration":3.64},{"text":"And our position is that whatever remains of the new construction doctrine in either phase of coverage, it clearly -- this Court's rulings have established that this does not apply to an improvement or an enlargement or -- or an expansion if that falls in the same category as repair and maintenance.","start":479.708,"stop":507.021,"duration":27.31},{"text":"Now, there is nothing in the legislative history at all to -- relating to new construction.","start":507.021,"stop":517.62,"duration":10.6},{"text":"The legislative reports did make clear both House and Senate reports stated in no uncertain terms that it was not the intent to make any drastic change in -- in the scope of coverage.","start":517.62,"stop":539.282,"duration":21.66},{"text":"The House Report, I should point out that there was a divergence of -- between the House and Senate proposals originally.","start":539.282,"stop":549.935,"duration":10.65},{"text":"The Senate didn't want to make any change in the definition of coverage, production coverage.","start":549.935,"stop":556.532,"duration":6.6},{"text":"The House had proposed a more drastic language of closely related and indispensable.","start":556.532,"stop":564.242,"duration":7.71},{"text":"The language, if the Act is enacted was a -- a compromise, and the reports of the Senate and House, I think, are the best evidence of what that compromise was intended to accomplish.","start":564.242,"stop":583.076,"duration":18.83},{"text":"The House Committee Report stated explicitly, the amended section gives the courts a more specific guide as to the intention of Congress.","start":583.076,"stop":592.987,"duration":9.91},{"text":"It does not, however, radically revise the coverage of the Act as it has been interpreted by the courts in the past.","start":592.987,"stop":600.624,"duration":7.64},{"text":"And this -- and the Senate conferees report also stated that it was not intended to substantially change and limit the decisions construing the prior necessary to production language but rather to provide more certainty in this field.","start":600.624,"stop":616.821,"duration":16.2},{"text":"And the Senate report specifically stated that the amended language adopts the standard of closely related which the Supreme Court has supplied in most of its decisions interpreting coverage.","start":616.821,"stop":627.356,"duration":10.53}]},{"speakerName":"Hugo L.

brief.","start":629.114,"stop":633.285,"duration":4.17},{"text":"And then the Senate report went on and said that the amendatory language is descriptive of activities which although not an integral part of productive operations have a relationship to production which may reasonably be considered close as distinguished from a remote entanglers and contemplates activities which are directly a production in a practical sense by providing something essential to carrying on in an effective, efficient and satisfactory manner of operations which are a part of an integrated effort for the production of goods.","start":633.285,"stop":668.319,"duration":35.03},{"text":"Now, we say that that language comes very close to the test this Court has established for determining whether activities are within the in commerce coverage.","start":668.319,"stop":682.487,"duration":14.17},{"text":"In the Vollmer case, the Court stated that the test was whether the work is so directly and vitally related to the functioning of an instrumentality or facility of interstate commerce as to be in practical effect a part of it rather than isolated local activity.","start":682.487,"stop":700.951,"duration":18.46},{"text":"And in the Lublin case, I'm relating to the plans and specifications for improvement of interstate instrumentalities, the Court say -- stated that it was whether the work is directly and vitally related to the functioning of those interstate facilities.","start":700.951,"stop":716.285,"duration":15.33},{"text":"Now, that language, I think -- we think parallel so closely the -- the Senate and House or the legislative statements as to what they intended by this closely related and directly essential language that it follows that work which is just as vitally and directly and closely related to production of goods for commerce as where the lock in dams and -- and the lock in dam and the lock in canal and the plans and specifications in the Vollmer and Lublin cases that there's no more reason for more restrictive they are -- more restrictive interpretation of the production coverage as amended in 1949.","start":716.285,"stop":769.253,"duration":52.97},{"text":"Now, the -- prior to 1949 as the Eighth Circuit pointed out, it was settled that the production coverage was much more flexible and broader than the in commerce coverage.","start":769.253,"stop":786.55,"duration":17.3},{"text":"So that the position of respondent and of the court below is that by the 1949 amendment, Congress reversed the situation that production coverage now is not even coextensive with the in commerce coverage that it's narrower and more rigid.","start":786.55,"stop":809.914,"duration":23.36},{"text":"In addition to the general statements in both House and Senate reports stating that they did not intend to have such a drastic change in their scope of production -- production coverage, the specific cases were mentioned -- were listed in both reports more in the Senate than in the House state -- stating what they specifically did not intend to change as to the scope of production coverage.","start":809.914,"stop":841.731,"duration":31.82},{"text":"And significantly, most significantly among those cases were the public utility cases producing and supplying electricity, gas, fuel, water, specifically mentioning water among those, the manufacturing of tools and dies and machinery to be used by other producers of goods and production of other goods for commerce and custodial and maintenance service furnished by an independent firm that might be serving customers generally.","start":841.731,"stop":876.581,"duration":34.85},{"text":"In fact all of these -- these -- in these three areas which both House and Senate reports endorsed and stated specifically would remain within the coverage of the Act, our typical examples of -- of facilities serving a general miscellany of customers but also well-known to be vitally essential -- vitally and substantially essential to the production of any goods for commerce.","start":876.581,"stop":908.419,"duration":31.84},{"text":"Ignoring all of these specific examples approved by both Houses, respondent relies primarily if not entirely on a few examples in the House Report which the House said it understood that the language would exclude from the coverage in two cases that respondents rely on, particularly the Super-A Fertilizer case and which was a decision of the First Circuit.","start":908.419,"stop":944.734,"duration":36.32},{"text":"I might point out that except for the window washing case, neither House nor Senate report disapproved any decision of this Court.","start":944.734,"stop":955.505,"duration":10.77},{"text":"They specifically approved the test of Kirschbaum.","start":955.505,"stop":958.514,"duration":3.01},{"text":"They said they intended -- both Houses said they intended to adopt the immediate -- close and immediate trial test of Kirschbaum.","start":958.514,"stop":966.906,"duration":8.39},{"text":"And -- that only -- not the Senate but the House said that it objected to holding at an industrial window washing company was within the coverage of the Act.","start":966.906,"stop":980.818,"duration":13.91},{"text":"Now, the -- in strictest logic some of the things the -- the House said would be excluded by the language if you apply it in constrict logic, it might be hard to reconcile those cases with the cases they explicitly said they intended to remain within the coverage of the Act.","start":980.818,"stop":1001.824,"duration":21.01},{"text":"But the -- certainly, that is no grounds for overwriting the joint intent as to the types of cases, both Houses intended to retain under the Act.","start":1001.824,"stop":1014.432,"duration":12.61},{"text":"And there certainly no reason for extending those cases, beyond what even the House suggested, they should go in order to narrow the coverage of the Act.","start":1014.432,"stop":1026.454,"duration":12.02},{"text":"Moreover, the cases are distinguishable.","start":1026.454,"stop":1029.279,"duration":2.83},{"text":"The Super-A Fertilizer case was the production of fertilizer used by farmers to produce sugarcane -- to fertilize the soil for production of sugarcane.","start":1029.279,"stop":1042.429,"duration":13.15},{"text":"And it's hard to reconcile that with a specific approval of the Reynolds water case which the Senate report specifically said they intended to endorse and would continue within the coverage.","start":1042.429,"stop":1055.905,"duration":13.48},{"text":"But apparently, the -- they could be reconciled and are distinguishable on the basis that fertilizer, although useful in the production of goods is not thought to be as vitally essential as water and fuel and electricity and gas and heat and tools and dies and machinery.","start":1055.905,"stop":1077.359,"duration":21.45},{"text":"The other case on which respondent relies and which is cited in the House Report is the Schroeder case, the production -- the quarrying of rock for the construction of a dike which was to protect an oil field from being flooded by a government project.","start":1077.359,"stop":1097.682,"duration":20.32},{"text":"The respondent emphasizes that case because he says it's like this one because it's a construction of a dam.","start":1097.682,"stop":1104.279,"duration":6.6},{"text":"But the -- the purposes are obviously quite different.","start":1104.279,"stop":1108.652,"duration":4.37},{"text":"But apart from that, it's significant that the House Report just says they disapproved of holding the quarry employees.","start":1108.652,"stop":1116.797,"duration":8.14},{"text":"The employees quarrying the rock and significantly, did not say that they disapproved of covering the employees engaged in the actual construction of the dike.","start":1116.797,"stop":1128.073,"duration":11.28},{"text":"And of course, we are concerned here with the employees engaged in the actual construction of this dam and reservoir.","start":1128.073,"stop":1140.161,"duration":12.09},{"text":"The window washing case in the same way -- in fact all of these -- all of these supplies and materials, the fertilizer and the rock and window washing could be said to be services or supplies which are not vitally essential to the productive process whereas plainly water, live electricity, gas and -- and coal and fuel and tools and dies and machinery is absolutely vital and essential to the production to -- of any goods for interstate commerce.","start":1140.161,"stop":1199.718,"duration":59.56},{"text":"We want to

question?","start":1204.235,"stop":1205.47,"duration":1.24},{"text":"What do you conceive to be the strongest case in your favor that's been decided by this Court?","start":1205.47,"stop":1214.298,"duration":8.83}]},{"speakerName":"Bessie Margolin","textObjs":[{"text":"I conceive our strongest argument to be that the utility cases that Congress expressly approved cases like the Florida Power and Light, the -- also the McCrady case which was a new -- construction of new plants for an existing steel company and some of these were new plants and was related to that particular company.","start":1214.298,"stop":1250.62,"duration":36.32},{"text":"I think the utility cases, the maintenance and repair cases and the custodial cases and the West Kentucky-Florida Power and Light, the coal company, gas case and electric cases and the Reynolds Water and Farmers Reservoir cases which were approved by Congress.","start":1250.62,"stop":1272.608,"duration":21.99},{"text":"Now, those were cases where the water was being furnished to exclusively, almost exclusively for farmers.","start":1272.608,"stop":1281.908,"duration":9.3},{"text":"But our point is that obviously that was not the -- a determinative factor with Congress in approving these cases because the general utilities do not furnish exclusively or even primarily to industries.","start":1281.908,"stop":1299.205,"duration":17.3},{"text":"In this case, it's submitted that some 40% to 50% of this water supply, of the existing water supply was devoted to industrial uses.","start":1299.205,"stop":1309.481,"duration":10.28},{"text":"And that practically, all the industrial users in Corpus Christi produced goods for interstate commerce.","start":1309.481,"stop":1315.554,"duration":6.07},{"text":"And it's been settled and generally and consistently held and, as I say, the legislative history of that 1949 amendment approved it obviously that it's the substantial and regular need and use of the facility for interstate commerce and not that it must be primarily or solely devoted to that use that invokes the coverage of the Act.","start":1315.554,"stop":1338.585,"duration":23.03},{"text":"So that I say that all these utility cases and the repair and maintenance holding, that the repair and maintenance and protection of utilities, facilities that unless you adopt a new construction give the broad interpretation to the new construction doctrine and apply it technically, you cannot distinguish this between the repair, maintenance and protection of the existing facility which has been consistently held covered.","start":1338.585,"stop":1372.537,"duration":33.95},{"text":"That the fact that it's a large and a big -- a big plant and a large construction project does not make it any less closely related or directly essential to supplying that absolutely essential and directly necessary facility for the production of goods for commerce.","start":1372.537,"stop":1393.763,"duration":21.23},{"text":"And that the same principles of the -- we -- we rely on the principles of the of Vollmer and Lublin case and with respect to the practical considerations which show that this is vital and essential.","start":1393.763,"stop":1412.494,"duration":18.73},{"text":"And that what is vital and essential to the functioning of interstate instrumentalities under those decisions is equally closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for commerce under the production coverages.","start":1412.494,"stop":1433.384,"duration":20.89},{"text":"And that or neither the court below nor respondent has taken issue with -- with the fact that -- that this water supply is just as closely related and directly essential and vital to the producers of goods for commerce and interstate instrumentalities as was the construction of the lock and canal in -- in Vollmer to the interstate traffic on that water-way or the plans and specifications in Lublin were to the interstate uses of the instrumentalities there being improved.","start":1433.384,"stop":1473.345,"duration":39.96},{"text":"No issue has been taken with the -- with practical fact that the relationship and the -- and the vital essentiality of this water supply is equally close and direct as -- as the facilities in those cases.","start":1473.345,"stop":1492.517,"duration":19.17},{"text":"Coming then to the injunction point, we recognize, of course, that the issuance of injunctive relief is largely discretionary with the trial court.","start":1492.517,"stop":1506.098,"duration":13.58},{"text":"But we believe this case illustrates that what is becoming or something of a problem in the lower courts particularly in this region where most the violations of -- large proportion have been appear that they're taking a mistaken view of the purpose and nature of the injunction and thus really obstructing enforcement and compliance rather than encouraging it or helping to deter violation.","start":1506.098,"stop":1537.481,"duration":31.38},{"text":"The attitude has been that the employer should be absolutely unfettered in -- in contesting doubtful coverage questions, questions which he in good faith thinks may be doubtful or if he relies in good faith on advice of -- of counsel.","start":1537.481,"stop":1558.73,"duration":21.25},{"text":"And that this is sufficient reason not to give any relief and in effect relief was denied here because that one project was virtually completed.","start":1558.73,"stop":1572.466,"duration":13.74},{"text":"This attitude, we think, just encourages employers to contest and litigate or take or decide not to comply until they have an opportunity to litigate because they have absolutely nothing to lose not even

remedy.","start":1612.546,"stop":1639.803,"duration":27.26},{"text":"But in enacting that provision, Congress made it clear that it was not saying that in a contempt action, the Court couldn't compel
