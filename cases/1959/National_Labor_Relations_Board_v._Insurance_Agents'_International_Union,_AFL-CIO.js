bargain, to meet and confer -- to meet and confer in good faith concerning the terms and conditions of employment and to reduce to writing upon request any agreement which it may arrive.","start":30.999,"stop":53.657,"duration":22.66},{"text":"The respondent union in this case in order to bring pressure to bear upon the employer to yield to its bargaining demands engaged in a

union which engages or directs the employees to engage in such activities and such tactics is guilty of a refusal to bargain in good faith within the meaning of the statute.","start":84.015,"stop":107.236,"duration":23.22},{"text":"The facts which give rise to our problem can be summarized quite briefly, the respondent union has, for some years, represented the insurance agents of the Prudential Insurance Company throughout the country.","start":107.236,"stop":122.229,"duration":14.99},{"text":"These agents who number many thousands are engaged in the business of selling insurance for the company and also servicing its policy holders.","start":122.229,"stop":131.796,"duration":9.57},{"text":"Early in 1956, the collective bargaining agreement which covered the terms and conditions of employment of these employees was about to terminate, and as a consequence, the company and the union entered into negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a new agreement to succeed the one which was about to expire.","start":131.796,"stop":151.391,"duration":19.6},{"text":"After approximately two months of negotiations, the company and the union had failed to arrive at an agreement.","start":151.391,"stop":158.33,"duration":6.94},{"text":"And at that time, the union instituted what it called its work without contract program, which I shall describe in a moment.","start":158.33,"stop":167.214,"duration":8.88},{"text":"This program continued at the same time that there negotiations between the company and the union were going on.","start":167.214,"stop":174.232,"duration":7.02},{"text":"It continued for approximately three months and it was called off at the end of the three months when the union informed its membership that it had served its purpose.","start":174.232,"stop":183.884,"duration":9.65},{"text":"And shortly thereafter, the company and the union entered into a collective bargaining agreement.","start":183.884,"stop":189.769,"duration":5.89},{"text":"Now, this -- under this so called work without contract program that the union instituted for the purpose of applying pressure to the company to yield to its demands, the employees refused to write new business.","start":189.769,"stop":205.205,"duration":15.44},{"text":"The writing of new business, new insurance policies is of course an important function of an insurance agent and of course, it's also an important aspect of any insurance company's business.","start":205.205,"stop":215.967,"duration":10.76},{"text":"And during this period, approximately seven weeks in duration, during the period that the employees refused to write new business, the company's business -- new business dropped many millions of dollars.","start":215.967,"stop":227.46,"duration":11.49},{"text":"At the end of approximately two months, the employees resumed -- resumed writing new business but at least some of the agents, however, refused to follow the procedures which the company had adopted for the orderly processing of this business.","start":227.46,"stop":242.811,"duration":15.35},{"text":"Normally, the agents would report new business to what is the applications therefore to their district manager.","start":242.811,"stop":249.312,"duration":6.5},{"text":"But under the work without contract program, the agents sent these reports and applications directly to the home office.","start":249.312,"stop":256.37,"duration":7.06},{"text":"Now, the record does not indicate what the effect of this departure from the procedure was, but I suppose there was -- it may have resulted in some amount of confusion in the handling -- in the handling of these reports and applications.","start":256.37,"stop":270.736,"duration":14.37},{"text":"Now in addition, under this work without contract program, the employees of -- the employees were directed by their union to ignore the company's working rules and other conditions of their employment.","start":270.736,"stop":284.5,"duration":13.76},{"text":"Under this program, the employees -- or let me say this.","start":284.5,"stop":289.964,"duration":5.46},{"text":"Normally, the employees report to their district officers twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays at 8:30 and normally they leave -- and they report there for purposes of making reports, having conferences, getting instructions and making financial accounts.","start":289.964,"stop":307.055,"duration":17.09},{"text":"And normally, on Tuesdays, they leave at 9:30 and then they go about their business and again on Friday, they leave at about 11:30 and then they go about their business.","start":307.055,"stop":317.143,"duration":10.09},{"text":"But under this program, however, they were instructed by the union not to report on either of these days prior to 10 o'clock.","start":317.143,"stop":324.046,"duration":6.9},{"text":"And then, to sit in the office and do as the union described it, and do what comes naturally, and then they would leave in a body, they would leave at a body at 12 o'clock.","start":324.046,"stop":338.044,"duration":14},{"text":"The further aspects of this program which the union conducted also required the employees to disregard conferences which the company would set up.","start":338.044,"stop":351.243,"duration":13.2},{"text":"The company, as part of its training and its sales program, set up -- sets up conferences with the various agents.","start":351.243,"stop":357.517,"duration":6.27},{"text":"And under the program, the employees refused to attend any of these conferences.","start":357.517,"stop":362.264,"duration":4.75},{"text":"And finally -- finally, as part of this program, the employees, at least during certain hours which would normally be regarded as their working time, engaged in mass demonstrations before the various company officers and in picketing and they also distributed -- they also distributed to the company's policy holders petitions for their signature apparently in a move to embarrass the company in which the policy holders would urge the company to sign a fair contract with its district agents.","start":362.264,"stop":393.404,"duration":31.14},{"text":"The union explained the advantages of its program to the -- its membership in this fashion.","start":393.404,"stop":404.122,"duration":10.72},{"text":"During the course of the program, the union wrote to its membership saying that the alternative to the union's program is total strike.","start":404.122,"stop":413.053,"duration":8.93},{"text":"I'm reading from page 105 of the record.","start":413.053,"stop":415.951,"duration":2.9},{"text":"“The alternative to the union's program is total strike or accepting the company's proposals which would do various things.”","start":415.951,"stop":422.625,"duration":6.67},{"text":"And then, that letter goes on to say, “It is inconceivable that any member of the union is willing to advocate any of the alternatives in preference to our program.","start":422.625,"stop":431.661,"duration":9.04},{"text":"While it is true that carrying out the program has its price in sacrifice and inconvenience in the light of the alternatives, the price is small.”","start":431.661,"stop":439.305,"duration":7.64},{"text":"And again, during the course of this program, the union had adverted to another advantage of the program as compared to its -- compared to the conventional strike action.","start":439.305,"stop":449.443,"duration":10.14},{"text":"The union wrote to its membership saying, “You know that the company is unhappy because our membership are able to draw their salaries while continuing the program.”","start":449.443,"stop":458.653,"duration":9.21},{"text":"May I say that during this period of this program was in effect, during which the employees were refusing to perform various important functions of their employment, they were drawing -- they were drawing compensation.","start":458.653,"stop":473.215,"duration":14.56},{"text":"They were even drawing compensation for a new business because the way the insurance company has -- that the insurance business is setup, the compensation of these employees is based upon what they add in their new business, or the collections that they have made during the preceding quarter.","start":473.215,"stop":488.596,"duration":15.38},{"text":"And eventually of course, the loss of commissions with respect to new business would be reflected -- would be reflected in the compensation of these agents.","start":488.596,"stop":497.898,"duration":9.3},{"text":"But otherwise, otherwise they were drawing their normal compensation.","start":497.898,"stop":502.887,"duration":4.99},{"text":"Now, the Board found that the union by instigating this program, these tactics, had refused to bargain in good faith within the meaning of the Act.","start":502.887,"stop":515.907,"duration":13.02},{"text":"The court below relying upon its earlier decision in the Textile Workers Union case which involved similar activities in an industrial plant, exonerated the union.","start":515.907,"stop":527.168,"duration":11.26},{"text":"Now, the critical difference I think between the Board on the one hand and the respondent and the court below on the other comes down I believe to this, the court below as well as the respondent union equates these activities, regard these activities as in the nature of partial strikes and that this is those you can not draw as of the inference of subjective bad faith from the use of a conventional strike, so you can draw none from the use of these tactics in this case.","start":527.168,"stop":561.598,"duration":34.43},{"text":"Now, it is our position that these destructive on the job pressures can not be equated with a strike, that they are inconsistent with the practice and procedures of collective bargaining, which we believe are embedded in the statute.","start":561.598,"stop":575.99,"duration":14.39},{"text":"And that because of that, they constituted a refusal of bargain in good faith within the meaning of the statute.","start":575.99,"stop":583.513,"duration":7.52},{"text":"Now

right to do that --","start":583.773,"stop":589.471,"duration":5.7}]},{"speakerName":"Dominick L. Manoli","textObjs":[{"text":"No, question Your Honor.","start":589.471,"stop":592.233,"duration":2.76},{"text":"Now, I think analysis of our problem begins with an understanding and with an examination of the practices and procedures of collective bargaining which we think the statute contemplates.","start":592.233,"stop":603.258,"duration":11.03},{"text":"As this Court has observed, the statute has absorbed the philosophy of collective bargaining has worked out in the labor movement in this country.","start":603.258,"stop":612.425,"duration":9.17},{"text":"And that philosophy is incorporated in the statute under the rubric to bargain collectively in good faith.","start":612.425,"stop":619.699,"duration":7.27},{"text":"Now, of course, the duty to bargain collectively in good faith presupposes that the management as well as the representative of the employees will meet and confer in an effort to iron out their differences and to arrive in an agreement through the process of negotiations.","start":619.699,"stop":635.56,"duration":15.86},{"text":"However, Congress realized that the collective bargaining mechanism would not function properly unless they were available to both parties' economic sanctions, because it's fairly obvious that the one party or the other can not either support its own demands with -- with threat of economic sanctions or resist the demands of the other with similar threats that the -- the terms of the collective bargaining agreement will be worked out by the dictate of one party rather than through the process of collective bargaining.","start":635.56,"stop":665.381,"duration":29.82},{"text":"Now, on the employer's side, on the employer's side, the economic sanctions which are available to him are in the final analysis the fact that he controls his business and that he controls the terms and conditions of employment.","start":665.381,"stop":680.004,"duration":14.62},{"text":"Now, on the employee side, on the employee side, their economic sanctions lie in their right to quit work and to go out on strike.","start":680.004,"stop":691.588,"duration":11.58},{"text":"Now, the prospect of a strike, the prospect of a strike plays an important role in the negotiations, because each side operates with an awareness of how far it can go in the -- in the course of the negotiations without bringing on a strike.","start":691.588,"stop":708.289,"duration":16.7},{"text":"And this awareness -- this awareness tempers the relationship and encourages each party that try to arrive in an agreement in terms of -- in the spirit of give and take.","start":708.289,"stop":718.735,"duration":10.45},{"text":"Now if they are unable to arrive with that agreement, then the employees have their traditional and their classic weapon to quit working and to go out on strike.","start":718.735,"stop":729.093,"duration":10.36},{"text":"Now, in this scheme -- in this scheme, the strike -- the strike weapon is an essential part of the collective bargaining process which the statute incorporates.","start":729.093,"stop":740.08,"duration":10.99},{"text":"And this we think -- this we think is the practice and procedure of collective bargaining which is embedded in this statute.","start":740.08,"stop":749.275,"duration":9.19},{"text":"This is evidenced I believe by Section 13 of the statute.","start":749.275,"stop":752.648,"duration":3.37},{"text":"Section 13 of the statute provides that the right to strike shall not be impaired -- shall not be impaired or diminished except as specifically provided in the statute.","start":752.648,"stop":764.179,"duration":11.53},{"text":"Now, in a statute like this one which is designed to encourage industrial peace, it would almost seem like an anomaly to give such special protection to the right to strike.","start":764.179,"stop":773.828,"duration":9.65},{"text":"And yet, in the long run, in the long run, the strike weapon serves the basic policies, the basic purposes of the statute, industrial peace for -- with some pretty glaring exceptions that I'm sure we're all familiar with as today, because in the long run, and generally, in the long run, the cost of the strike is such -- is such that it teaches both sides to compromise their differences.","start":773.828,"stop":798.451,"duration":24.62},{"text":"Now, let me turn to the tactics that were used here.","start":798.451,"stop":802.044,"duration":3.59},{"text":"These tactics in our judgment certainly do not occupy, do not occupy the protected -- the privileged position that the strike does in the statute.","start":802.044,"stop":811.069,"duration":9.02},{"text":"And secondly, they do not serve the functions of -- of carrying out the basic policies of the statute.","start":811.069,"stop":819.16,"duration":8.09},{"text":"These activities are the counterpart of the industrial slowdown, the intermittent work stoppage, which this Court dealt with in the Briggs Stratton and Auto Workers case some years ago.","start":819.16,"stop":833.523,"duration":14.36},{"text":"As the Court observed in that case, activities of this kind do not enjoy the protection that the strike does under the Act.","start":833.523,"stop":840.313,"duration":6.79},{"text":"The employees who are engaged in these activities expose themselves to discharge without recourse to the protection of the statute.","start":840.313,"stop":847.497,"duration":7.18},{"text":"Moreover, although these tactics have not been completely unknown, they have not been regarded as character -- as a characteristic bargaining technique in the American Labor Movement.","start":847.497,"stop":857.855,"duration":10.36},{"text":"Indeed, I may say that they have been described -- they have characterized as the diseases of collective bargaining rather than of its nature as the -- as the conventional strike is.","start":857.855,"stop":871.486,"duration":13.63},{"text":"The -- these tactics we think are no -- are no part of the practice and procedures of collective bargaining which Congress contemplated no part of the practice and procedures on collective bargaining which we think are embedded in this statute.","start":871.486,"stop":891.478,"duration":19.99},{"text":"These -- these tactics they distort -- they distort the play of economic forces that Congress contemplated in order to make the collective bargaining mechanism function properly.","start":891.478,"stop":903.226,"duration":11.75},{"text":"The -- these -- these tactics are designed to -- they're designed to, in the sense -- in the sense to compel the employer to subsidize the employees who are unwilling to strike and yet who are unwilling to perform all of their duties.","start":903.226,"stop":926.119,"duration":22.89},{"text":"Now, of course, from the union's standpoint, from the union's standpoint, this is a very desirable thing.","start":926.119,"stop":931.481,"duration":5.36},{"text":"But it is not the play -- it is not the play of the economic forces which Congress contemplated as -- as essential, as necessary to make the collective bargaining mechanism function properly.","start":931.481,"stop":943.586,"duration":12.11},{"text":"The conventional strike -- the conventional strike puts both parties under some substantial restraint to come to -- to hammer out -- to hammer out an agreement in the spirit of give and take.","start":943.586,"stop":957.12,"duration":13.53},{"text":"But, as this Court has noted that pressures which are generated, the pressures which are generated by these disruptive on-the-job pressures are entirely different.","start":957.12,"stop":966.412,"duration":9.29},{"text":"They permit the employees to stay on the job, to receive compensation in whole or at least in part.","start":966.412,"stop":972.702,"duration":6.29},{"text":"On the other hand, the employer has to operate his business as though it were operating in its normal fashion.","start":972.702,"stop":978.947,"duration":6.25},{"text":"And the consequence is, the tendency -- the tendency is that there would be less compulsion upon the union to settle except upon its own terms.","start":978.947,"stop":989.389,"duration":10.44},{"text":"And this is not collective
