the District of Columbia and in the City of Richmond, Virginia.","start":173.326,"stop":187.027,"duration":13.7},{"text":"At the time of this action, neither the District of Columbia nor Virginia was

area office, and also selling to certain selected wholesalers in the area and the wholesalers then in turn sell to the retailers.","start":204.63,"stop":220.718,"duration":16.09},{"text":"However, since Parke Davis gives quantity discounts, which it does not permitted wholesaler to give, it is cheaper to the retailers to purchase directly from Parke Davis than to purchase through the wholesalers.","start":220.718,"stop":234.505,"duration":13.79},{"text":"Now, the principal activities of Parke Davis in this case were taken against five retailers in this

prices are suggested.","start":258.869,"stop":278.885,"duration":20.02},{"text":"In June of 1956, the manager of the Parke Davis' Baltimore office attended a meeting of the company at the company's headquarters in Detroit and at that time he raised the question what they could do about this price cutting that is going on in the district, and he was he told by the president of the company that they had a policy that they would not sell to price-cutting retailers in non-fair trade areas.","start":278.885,"stop":306.795,"duration":27.91},{"text":"When he returned from his meeting in Detroit, the branch manager called in his area manager for Washington and instructed this area manager to go and cut off these price cutting retailers if they refused to conform to Parke Davis' policy and at

retailers that Parke Davis had this policy of selling only to people who observed the state of resale prices and furthermore, warned them that if they didn't stop this practice of price cutting, Parke Davis would cut them off on its own direct sales and would also cut them off on the sales to wholesalers.","start":348.886,"stop":372.127,"duration":23.24},{"text":"In several instances, when they

refused to stop price cutting.","start":380.63,"stop":385.285,"duration":4.66},{"text":"Parke Davis then cut them off on direct sales and also told the wholesalers or requested the wholesalers to stop selling to them.","start":385.285,"stop":397.471,"duration":12.19},{"text":"Now, Parke Davis suggests that all it did in approaching the retailers and the wholesalers was to announce its policy to them and that's its basic defense in this case.","start":397.471,"stop":408.328,"duration":10.86},{"text":"They said, \"We have a policy, we wouldn't sell to you, and we just announced this policy and
