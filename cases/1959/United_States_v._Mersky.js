Congress and not administrative regulation.","start":712.477,"stop":721.995,"duration":9.52},{"text":"Although of course, as the basic premise administrative regulation have the force of law, but the none -- it nonetheless remains true that as to any specific statutory Act done by Congress, it's necessary to look at the context in which the words have been used to determine whether the statute as used in that particular piece of legislation also includes administrative regulations.","start":721.995,"stop":752.661,"duration":30.67},{"text":"We think that, since so far as the Criminal Appeals

passed by Congress and this status of subordination has been consistently maintained.","start":768.389,"stop":785.082,"duration":16.69},{"text":"For example, only Congress may impose a criminal

revocation of a regulation does not have this effect, that is the affect of terminating prosecution.","start":809.992,"stop":824.562,"duration":14.57},{"text":"So, that in the end, the regulation, no matter how sweeping they maybe, must find their justification within the basic statue which authorizes their issuance.","start":824.562,"stop":837.533,"duration":12.97},{"text":"With these considerations in mind then that the regulation is subordinate to the Act of Congress and that there may well be a real difference, a look at 18 U.S.C. 3731 that is the Criminal Appeals Act.","start":837.533,"stop":855.129,"duration":17.6},{"text":"The provision in the Criminal Appeals Act for direct review here on -- at the request of the Government has always been narrowly construed by this Court.","start":855.129,"stop":867.636,"duration":12.51},{"text":"It's always been construed, so to deny Supreme Court jurisdiction when it is reasonably possible to do so.","start":867.636,"stop":874.987,"duration":7.35},{"text":"And there's a -- there's a reason for this, it has been said that in one aspect at least, the history of this Court is the progressive contraction of mandatory review.","start":874.987,"stop":888.405,"duration":13.42},{"text":"Obviously, Congress has a -- had to keep the work within capability of the nine judges sitting here and so, we've always seen a gradual withdrawal of provisions for automatic review.","start":888.405,"stop":906.03,"duration":17.63},{"text":"Now, the Criminal Appeals Act runs counter to this trend of the year and perhaps because of this and perhaps because of other reasons such as the reason that an appeal by the Government is not usually favored.","start":906.03,"stop":921.262,"duration":15.23},{"text":"This Court has always narrowly construed the Criminal Appeals
