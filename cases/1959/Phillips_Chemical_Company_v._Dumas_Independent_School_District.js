tax-exempt property.","start":547.922,"stop":556.191,"duration":8.27},{"text":"7173, which said, that lessees of tax-exempt property, if their term is for less than three years, they pay no tax on the tax-exempt property, and 7174, which in effect says, “If the lease of tax-exempt property is for more than three years, then the lessee shall pay a tax based only on the value of the leasehold,” not

a large classification of tax-exempt lessees.","start":633.319,"stop":640.768,"duration":7.45},{"text":"It included all lessees of tax-exempt property, lessees of federal property, state, county, municipal, irrigation districts, every lessee of tax-exempt property was included in this great large classification and that had existed for 70 years.","start":640.768,"stop":661.756,"duration":20.99},{"text":"So what the legislature did in 1950 was just carve into this long-term classification of lessees, they carved into that and extracted from it just the lessees of federal property.","start":661.756,"stop":681.814,"duration":20.06},{"text":"And so the Court said, what then happens to the lessees of federal property now that they've been carved out of this classification.","start":681.814,"stop":690.631,"duration":8.82},{"text":"The Supreme Court of Texas held that with a federal lessee, if his term of lease is less than three years, he pays a tax based on the full value of the fee, whereas back in the old classification, all other lessees of tax-exempt property paid no tax at all if the lease was for less than three years.","start":690.631,"stop":717.966,"duration":27.34},{"text":"Over here, if a lessee of federal property had a term of more than three years, it made no difference to him, he still pay the tax base on the full value of the fee, while over in the old classification, lessees of other tax-exempt property in excess of three years, they paid a tax only based on the value of the leasehold and not on the value of the fee.","start":717.966,"stop":747.237,"duration":29.27},{"text":"So that when that was made clear as it was below, four of the justices of the Supreme Court said, “This appears to

to both the letter and the spirit of the United States Constitution.","start":747.237,"stop":776.46,"duration":29.22},{"text":"Now, I believe the question enters one's mind, that if it appears so

Company leased this plant, this plant was valued at a very large sum.","start":793.359,"stop":800.599,"duration":7.24},{"text":"Yet the assessor says, “Although you just -- you have a lease and the

five who sustained the validity, how were they able to overcome this direct and unequivocal discrimination?","start":822.919,"stop":837.771,"duration":14.85},{"text":"Well there were some three or four bases that they offered.","start":837.771,"stop":843.701,"duration":5.93},{"text":"Now the one that they seem to attach the most importance to was, they said, why this tax, that this statute in 1950, is constitutional, because the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that this kind of statute is constitutional.","start":843.701,"stop":860.721,"duration":17.02},{"text":"And they said, “All you have to do is look at the case of Borg-Warner.","start":860.721,"stop":866.11,"duration":5.39},{"text":"Borg-Warner, Your Honors will recall, is one of the three cases decided by this Court

first, the Borg-Warner, is the one they depend on mostly because it is closest in perhaps facts to this.","start":880.211,"stop":889.919,"duration":9.71},{"text":"In the Borg-Warner case, Michigan

Government.","start":889.919,"stop":909.499,"duration":19.58},{"text":"Therefore, these five gentlemen in Texas, they see there, in the Borg-Warner case, the Supreme Court said, “a State passes a statute.","start":909.499,"stop":918.603,"duration":9.1},{"text":"It permits that State to level a tax against the lessee of federal property and it permits us to level the tax on the basis of the value of the property which the lessee got from the Government.”","start":918.603,"stop":933.192,"duration":14.59},{"text":"Now what -- I submit -- what they failed to consider or what they chose to disregard was the fact that in those cases and in the -- particularly the Borg-Warner which was the first of the three cases and the lead of the three cases, this Court held very clearly that such tax as it approved in -- in that Borg-Warner case, the Michigan statute, that that tax was approved only on the basis that it was nondiscriminatory.","start":933.192,"stop":971.374,"duration":38.18},{"text":"That it applied to all lessees of all tax-exempt property and didn't single any particular group of lessees
