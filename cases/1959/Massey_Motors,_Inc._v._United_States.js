footing.","start":597.851,"stop":603.893,"duration":6.04},{"text":"There, the question was simply whether the rental cars were held primarily for sales, sets business practice showed that they were sold after approximately one year of use.","start":603.893,"stop":614.394,"duration":10.5},{"text":"And there, the Third Circuit reversed Judge Ron's decision from the Tax Court and held the taxpayer

II.","start":679.866,"stop":698.786,"duration":18.92},{"text":"Hence, we had a ready market for the cars and that, of course, is true in Evans too, they can't deny
