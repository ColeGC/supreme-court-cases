thing that was raised in this reply brief which is a reference to the case of People versus Morton, this New York case where a husband was indicted for larceny of his wife's property and before the married women's statute of New York, he couldn't have been indicted.","start":1792.749,"stop":1821.608,"duration":28.86},{"text":"And I think that's what the Court says in their opinion, but all that

statues by the common law.","start":1821.608,"stop":1843.727,"duration":22.12},{"text":"And therefore when the statute says that the husband doesn't have any property interest in his wife's property that it belongs to her, he can be prosecuted for -- for stealing that property and it doesn't have any effect upon the marital unity or the marital relationship itself, it just has to do with that particular question of property that's involved and we have the same situation in California I believe in the footnote here they cite the case of People versus Gros right in 59 Cal. App. 706 which I -- wherever I start in 19 -- and that's a case where the an indictment was returned charging a man -- woman with the investment of her husband's property and forgery of her husband's

Justice who wrote that opinion the Supreme Court ought to do something about that or the Legislature ought to do something about it.","start":1930.522,"stop":1965.73,"duration":35.21},{"text":"In other words, if there was to be a change in the law and it was recommended that the Supreme Court or the Legislature take some action to declare the status of husband and wife so that there would be a

Government's brief here that they're asking this Court to not only reverse the ruling of the United States District Court, but they're asking this Court to lay down a series of rules of procedure in
