engaged in virtually all spaces of the oil business.","start":117.71,"stop":123.921,"duration":6.21},{"text":"In addition at present, it is producing and selling natural gas under about a 160 long

contracts in the industry offer terms of 20 years or more.","start":135.88,"stop":145.315,"duration":9.44},{"text":"Sun Ray also produces substantial qualities of crude oil and frequently in conjunction with natural gas.","start":145.315,"stop":152.449,"duration":7.13},{"text":"Sun Ray refines the crude oil into fuel oil, to gasoline and other products and sell these various products to the public and to the Government.","start":152.449,"stop":161.971,"duration":9.52},{"text":"By contract dated February -- January 1, 1957, Sunray agreed to sell United Gas Pipeline Company gas produced from certain lands and acreage owned by it in Lafayette and Vermilion Parishes in Louisiana.","start":161.971,"stop":179.27,"duration":17.3},{"text":"At present, Sunray is only known of

7 --- 7000 acres have been developed and have proven to have gas reserves.","start":199.312,"stop":207.39,"duration":8.08},{"text":"Under the contract, Sunray is to deliver in United's tank annual minimum quantities about 4.5% of the estimated reserves.","start":207.39,"stop":218.585,"duration":11.2},{"text":"The United in addition is to have a further right, annually to take up to an

additional reserves are to be included under the contract.","start":246.389,"stop":254.288,"duration":7.9},{"text":"However, such inclusion is only for the remainder of the 20-year term from the time when these additional reserves are discovered.","start":254.288,"stop":262.851,"duration":8.56},{"text":"In other words, if a -- if an additional reserve is discovered, say 10 years from now, that

20-year period.","start":272.336,"stop":278.531,"duration":6.19},{"text":"These specific quantities of gas as -- are to be sold and delivered for a basic term of 20 years.","start":278.531,"stop":286.142,"duration":7.61},{"text":"Highlighting the fact that the contract is for the specific quantity of gas, is the provision that of Sunray should use any of the gas for re-pressuring or recycling operations so that it cannot deliver the fourth or annual minimum to United in any specific year, the contract is to be extended for a sufficient period of time to make up to deficiency.","start":286.142,"stop":307.567,"duration":21.43},{"text":"In other words, United has a guarantee, they will get the annual minimum for 20 years and it can take up to 50%

contract.","start":316.31,"stop":321.19,"duration":4.88},{"text":"On March 11, 1957, Sunray applied to the Commission for authority to sell this gas under this contract to United under Section 7 (a)

duration.","start":441.009,"stop":450.533,"duration":9.52},{"text":"The Commission, with the approval of the court below, assumed that the act established a presumption that certificates are to be unlimited in duration.","start":450.533,"stop":463.716,"duration":13.18},{"text":"Based on this presumption, the Commission ruled that Sunray had not made out a case justifying the issuance of a limited certificate.","start":463.716,"stop":474.825,"duration":11.11},{"text":"In other words, so far as the Commission was concerned, all certificates are -- are to be of unlimited duration unless

here.","start":696.143,"stop":700.955,"duration":4.81},{"text":"As I say, it's our position that where an applicant applies for authority to sell gas for a period coextensive with the sales contract, the Commission's authority is limited generally or I say generally, to issuing a certificate for that term.","start":700.955,"stop":718.036,"duration":17.08},{"text":"Section 7 (e) of the Act which I've just read expressly so states as we read it, as the Court recall, that Section provides for the issuance of a certificate authorizing the whole or any part of the sale covered by the application.","start":718.036,"stop":737.741,"duration":19.71},{"text":"When as in the case, such as we have here, the whole of the application is for a certificate of a -- for a limited period, the issuance of a certificate for longer period of time or if indefinite duration exceeds the bounds of the application and the contract enhances not within the Commission's authority under Section 7 (e).","start":737.741,"stop":760.818,"duration":23.08},{"text":"Now, this reading of Section 7 (e), we think does not mean that the applicant is able to dictate the terms and conditions under which he'll sell his gas in interstate commerce.","start":760.818,"stop":775.311,"duration":14.49},{"text":"This Court that latter in so called capital Atlantic Refining case last term, held flatly that there was nothing in the Natural Gas Act that precluded an applicant from standing firm on his terms and conditions from making a sale provided he haven't sold this gas yet, and this is that type of case.","start":775.311,"stop":794.357,"duration":19.05},{"text":"At the same time however, the Commission is not required to authorize a new sale unless it finds that the applicants proposed terms and conditions are in the public interest.","start":794.357,"stop":806.902,"duration":12.55},{"text":"If the Commission finds that they are on a public interest they issue us a certificate.","start":806.902,"stop":811.73,"duration":4.83},{"text":"If they find that is not, they deny the certificate.","start":811.73,"stop":814.979,"duration":3.25},{"text":"And in the course of making that determination, there's no reason why they cannot take into account the term for which the sale was being made.","start":814.979,"stop":824.074,"duration":9.09},{"text":"They do that everyday in the pipeline cases.","start":824.074,"stop":827.588,"duration":3.51},{"text":"One of the most important factor in the pipeline certificate case is the adequacy of reserves.","start":827.588,"stop":834.333,"duration":6.75},{"text":"And the Commission looks to the reserves and if its for less than of prescribed minimum, they'll deny the certificate.","start":834.333,"stop":841.763,"duration":7.43},{"text":"If it's for -- meets their standards for of minimum -- of minimum requirements, they'll grant it.","start":841.763,"stop":847.365,"duration":5.6},{"text":"And I might point out in addition that whereas here, we -- we're willing to sell the gas for 20 years.","start":847.365,"stop":853.974,"duration":6.61},{"text":"In the pipeline cases, the Commission is now accepting reserves down to 10 and 11 years as is being adequate as in the public interest.","start":853.974,"stop":863.072,"duration":9.1},{"text":"Now, we want to point out further that this reading of the Section 7 (e) is nowhere conflicts with Section 7 (b) of the Act.","start":863.072,"stop":871.46,"duration":8.39},{"text":"In order to create a conflict, Mr. Wahrenbrock in the Sun Oil case and he'll probably argue here again, seeks to read into Section 7 (b), a general congressional mandate to assure indefinite continuity of service.","start":871.46,"stop":887.224,"duration":15.76},{"text":"But Section 7 (b) is not that broad.","start":887.224,"stop":890.535,"duration":3.31},{"text":"The only abandonment authority granted by -- to the Commission by that Section is lower and I'm quoting.","start":890.535,"stop":897.205,"duration":6.67},{"text":"“Facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or any sale rendered by means of such facilities, it's limited to certain kind of service assuming that what Sunray is doing here is making a service.","start":897.205,"stop":912.665,"duration":15.46},{"text":"It's providing a service rather than just selling gas.”","start":912.665,"stop":915.46,"duration":2.8},{"text":"Now, we can go back in that point to 7 (e) which has -- says, sale common service and as Sunray applied for was authority to make a sale, not to render a service.","start":915.46,"stop":927.236,"duration":11.78},{"text":"But assuming that Sunray is engaged in providing a service, there would still be -- or even get to whether or not this is subject to 7 (b), it says facility subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.","start":927.236,"stop":940.307,"duration":13.07},{"text":"That is the prerequisite, is that you stop there first and if you -- you find facilities, then you go on and service, but if you don't find facilities, you don't have any service.","start":940.307,"stop":950.667,"duration":10.36},{"text":"The same broad reading of Section 7 (b), I might add, that the Commission have the case here was advanced by it in the Panhandle case in 337 U.S.","start":950.667,"stop":963.538,"duration":12.87},{"text":"And with respect -- as -- as expressly rejected by this Court, properly read as far as we see it, Section 7 (b) is in complete harmony with our reading of Section 7 (e).","start":963.538,"stop":977.729,"duration":14.19},{"text":"As we see it, a certificate issued under Section 7 (e) defines the period definite or indefinite.","start":977.729,"stop":985.162,"duration":7.43},{"text":"But it defines the period that the sale is to be made of the service rendered.","start":985.162,"stop":989.691,"duration":4.53},{"text":"We applied for a certificate of limited duration and that defines the scope of the Commission's jurisdiction to issue a certificate.","start":989.691,"stop":996.661,"duration":6.97},{"text":"Section 7 (b) in turn applied only when there is an attempt to abandon service short of the period set out in the contract.","start":996.661,"stop":1005.482,"duration":8.82},{"text":"In other words, assuming that Sunray is making a sale of serve -- providing a service here and it has jurisdictional facilities so it's subject to 7 (b).","start":1005.482,"stop":1014.928,"duration":9.45},{"text":"Then Sections -- sale we -- and we applied for a certificate of limited duration and we obtained it, the Commission gives it to us.","start":1014.928,"stop":1023.403,"duration":8.48},{"text":"Then Sunray cannot discontinue that self-service of sale within the period so it's covered by the certificate, i.e. for 20
