testified, this is on page 21 of the record that he had talked – he -- Mohawk's accountant that is, had talked with Mr. Berman, explained to Mr. Berman that the Cadillac was recorded as a gift, it would not be deductible as such.","start":392.072,"stop":414.913,"duration":22.84},{"text":"Mr. Berman wanted to know how it would be deducted and presumably the accountant told him it would be deductible if it was treated by the corporation as its business expense.","start":414.913,"stop":425.041,"duration":10.13},{"text":"Now, I think it might be pointed out here that from the Government's standpoint, form the standpoint of just the revenue involved getting additional taxes, we would be in a more advantageous position if this were, in fact, a gift from Mr. Berman personally as individual capacity to Mr. Duberstein because in that event, even though Mr. Duberstein would report it as income, he would treat it as a gift assuming it was a valid gift on the analysis which I propose to make.","start":425.041,"stop":462.486,"duration":37.44},{"text":"Berman, of course, could not deduct it, personal gifts are not

since the corporate funds were being used for this purpose, there might -- would it be a proper case of treating that $4250 which was used for that purpose by Berman so that he could make a gift in his individual capacity to Duberstein, he would be using corporation funds and there would be a constructive distribution to him on which he would pay tax so the corporation couldn't take the deduction on the money that was used to pay the car and neither could Berman.","start":470.659,"stop":505.817,"duration":35.16},{"text":"Now, so that, as I say, the question is to whether it's gift or not, it doesn't really depend on whether Government is going to benefit it from a tax standpoint and it shouldn't depend on that.","start":505.817,"stop":519.626,"duration":13.81},{"text":"Now, on these facts which are undisputed, the Tax Court held that it was not a gift.","start":519.626,"stop":527.228,"duration":7.6},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed the Tax Court and held it was a

all pretty read in the same way.","start":549.988,"stop":553.366,"duration":3.38},{"text":"The question whether it's a gift depends upon – is a question of fact depending upon the intention of the
