exemption is to that of Section 7 (c) which insofar is pertinent here, provides for an exemption of for not more than 14 work weeks in a calendar year, for employment of employees in a place where the

accumulated.","start":99.847,"stop":122.793,"duration":22.95},{"text":"I'll say that the issues turn on this -- the same language at least all the issues that were raised in the court below, the whole

standing interpretation has been that this seasonal -- that it is a seasonal exemption limited to -- to the purpose of giving relief, the seasonal commodities during the peak season when prompt processing is essential for preservation of the crop and when the heavy influx during the short harvesting season can be handled only by working large quantities of labor for long hours and that it

it.","start":723.324,"stop":775.737,"duration":52.41},{"text":"This position as we'll later it show, has been the long standing interpretation of the administrator and has received the approval of --

reduction in the number of employees at the close of the active season in this case, indicates that the purpose of the exemption does not apply.","start":866.858,"stop":885.835,"duration":18.98},{"text":"There's other legislative history which we go into in our brief, particularly the -- the turning down of a -- an amendment which would

out that the broader proposal, coffee proposal was -- was made because the first processing language might not include all operations leading to the final marketing.","start":885.835,"stop":927.354,"duration":41.52},{"text":"Now, the trial court took the position that the -- that the only reasonable interpretation of the first processing of fresh

statute on its face, that the phrasing of the language of this statute, its context in -- in relation to other provisions of the statute, make it clear beyond doubt that the first processing as used
