required two men, no more than two men to perform.","start":138.116,"stop":163.475,"duration":25.36},{"text":"About two days before the accident, one the pumps of the vessel had become out of order

between the dock and the Winisook, the respondent maintained a further facility, a floating raft.","start":188.114,"stop":194.666,"duration":6.55},{"text":"This raft is used by the respondent for the chipping, and painting, and repair work of such of its vessels as needed to such to work to be done at such time when it was needed.","start":194.666,"stop":204.87,"duration":10.2},{"text":"And when

Winisook, the Pfeifer number two and it was conceded that in order for any crew men of the Pfeifer number two to get -- to go to shore, he would have to go by way of the Winosook, by way the catwalk,

again.","start":249.366,"stop":265.124,"duration":15.76},{"text":"It was the intention that he work until four o' clock in the afternoon at that day or sooner if the vessel left sooner and as the

claim that the petitioner had been discharged and then immediately rehired as a compensate to give him a chance to make a day's pay for working on this raft, as described, but that was categorically

him.","start":333.992,"stop":338.326,"duration":4.33},{"text":"He got his tools together, he got his materials together, went over to the side of Winisook which was nearer to the raft, put his tools

it.","start":338.326,"stop":353.527,"duration":15.2},{"text":"And while his pulling on his line, the catwalk or ladder on which he necessary have to stand and which was part of the Winisook, gave way

injury occurs by reason of a defective condition of the employer's vessel where he had to be in order to do what he had been directed to do and it seems to me that plain application of this only stated test in the Senko case just comes close to the finding that he was injured while in the course of his in employment as a seaman and a member of the crew.","start":580.974,"stop":619.893,"duration":38.92},{"text":"My friend here says that it is not enough that all these conceded facts that are not enough, that there must be an additional factor

such a relationship is necessary to establish the petitioner's right to a Jones Act remedy here is the following.","start":634.806,"stop":644.438,"duration":9.63},{"text":"The testimony was that the raft was used to paint and chip and repair such of -- the -- such of the respondent's vessel as needed it.","start":644.438,"stop":653.154,"duration":8.72},{"text":"In addition, at page 48, Smith the

owned and maintained by the defendant and where he had to be in order to do what he'd been ordered to do, that the nature of the work he was about to perform whether it service the vessel or was
