dam.","start":150.754,"stop":180.901,"duration":30.15},{"text":"There are 18 spillways all the way down to the Washington side, number one down to the Oregon side, number

underneath.","start":309.922,"stop":336.428,"duration":26.51},{"text":"And so he told the United States that he wanted to take a tugboat and a barge and go up there and anchor or lash a barge in by
