seaworthiness.","start":2070.855,"stop":2077.973,"duration":7.12},{"text":"Now, after all, Mr. Freedman's client is trying to recover here for breach of the warranty of

in the abstract, what are requirements for recovery for a breach of warranty, implied warranty of any sort.","start":2090.715,"stop":2105.765,"duration":15.05},{"text":"First, the implied warranty must not be negated by something express in the contract or implicit in the circumstances.","start":2105.765,"stop":2116.28,"duration":10.52},{"text":"Second, there must be reasonable reliance such as a prudent person would have upon the warranty that is implied.","start":2116.28,"stop":2127.17,"duration":10.89},{"text":"Finally, the plaintiff or libelant must rely upon the warranty and be damaged by its breach.","start":2127.17,"stop":2138.999,"duration":11.83},{"text":"Now, let's look at the history of the breach -- of the implied warranty for seaworthiness.","start":2138.999,"stop":2148.865,"duration":9.87},{"text":"Aside from cargo and passenger cases, it takes its origin in the case of Osceola where the Court said there was an implied warranty of the sea -- of seaworthiness of a vessel for the voyage.","start":2148.865,"stop":2167.862,"duration":19},{"text":"And that it made no difference that the sea that the -- the defect was one that existed without the fault or knowledge of the shipowner.","start":2167.862,"stop":2179.848,"duration":11.99},{"text":"Now Your Honors will recall that Osceola was a case of the ship having been equipped with some gear for putting out the gangway when she came to shore and this was found to be stated in the question certified to be entirely seaworthy and proper.","start":2179.848,"stop":2199.645,"duration":19.8},{"text":"The difficulty in Osceola was that the master put out the rigging to hold the gangway while she was out where the wind would catch her.","start":2199.645,"stop":2208.685,"duration":9.04},{"text":"The vessel was making some 11 knots and there was an 8-knot wind.","start":2208.685,"stop":2214.192,"duration":5.51},{"text":"And the gangway thrashed around and hurt the man who was injured and that was the way the case came up.","start":2214.192,"stop":2222.925,"duration":8.73},{"text":"So now you'll notice that this is a question of warranty of seaworthiness for a voyage which is in actual operation.","start":2222.925,"stop":2235.18,"duration":12.25},{"text":"Now, that is the first time that we have the warranty of seaworthiness implied in favor of a seaman.","start":2235.18,"stop":2245.684,"duration":10.5},{"text":"Now the next case, if Your Honors please, was Mr. Justice McReynolds' opinion in Carlisle Packing Company against Sandanger.","start":2245.684,"stop":2255.201,"duration":9.52},{"text":"I'm sure we all remember this in the classical way.","start":2255.201,"stop":2257.775,"duration":2.57},{"text":"This is the coal oil can case as opposed to the malice case or something like that.","start":2257.775,"stop":2262.796,"duration":5.02},{"text":"They had a coal oil can, marked coal oil aboard and it had gasoline in it.","start":2262.796,"stop":2269.057,"duration":6.26},{"text":"And it was held by the Court that this was a breach of the warranty of seaworthiness because a coal oil can was warranted to have coal oil in it and not gasoline and therefore, Mr. Sandanger was entitled to a recovery.","start":2269.057,"stop":2289.168,"duration":20.11},{"text":"Now, once again please note that this is an implied warranty of seaworthiness for a voyage.","start":2289.168,"stop":2298.79,"duration":9.62},{"text":"This happened while he was on the voyage.","start":2298.79,"stop":2302.255,"duration":3.47},{"text":"We come next -- oh I might say in -- in Sandanger that Mr. Justice McReynolds emphasized the point by giving as his authority the Silvia and the Southwark.","start":2302.255,"stop":2320.934,"duration":18.68},{"text":"Now, Silvia was a case involving whether there was a breach of the warranty of the seaworthiness to cargo where a perfectly proper porthole was left open.","start":2320.934,"stop":2335.13,"duration":14.2},{"text":"And that it was held there was no breach of the warranty of seaworthiness that these was just negligent management by the officers and crew in not shutting up the porthole when they got in bad weather.","start":2335.13,"stop":2345.397,"duration":10.27},{"text":"Southwark was a somewhat similar type of situation in respect to refrigerator machinery.","start":2345.397,"stop":2352.376,"duration":6.98},{"text":"Now, this again is the development of the concept and the scope and what have you of the warranty of seaworthiness of a vessel.","start":2352.376,"stop":2362.458,"duration":10.08},{"text":"It is for a voyage.","start":2362.458,"stop":2364.358,"duration":1.9},{"text":"The next case in this Court of importance was of course the Mahnich case this is the Wolf case.","start":2364.358,"stop":2373.048,"duration":8.69},{"text":"The shipowner put aboard unsound line and sound line.","start":2373.048,"stop":2378.997,"duration":5.95},{"text":"And he didn't cut the unsound line up into small lengths so the mate took some of the old defective line and rigged the boatswain's chair or something of the sort with it, held that their having of the line aboard in such lengths that it might be used for a boatswain's chair was an unseaworthiness of the vessel.","start":2378.997,"stop":2402.683,"duration":23.69},{"text":"Now, once again, in the course of the voyage, the implied warranty of seaworthiness for the voyage is just same as the warranty of seaworthiness which is made to the shipper of cargo and to the passenger, it is for the voyage.","start":2402.683,"stop":2419.167,"duration":16.48},{"text":"Now, we come next to Sieracki.","start":2419.167,"stop":2422.232,"duration":3.07},{"text":"You will recall that in loading the vessel, a shackle broke, held that even though the man was not a seaman in the literal sense and was not subject to the discipline which the Court had referred to in Mahnich as the reason why you have the same kind of a warranty in favor of a seaman as in favor of passengers and cargo that is to say that they couldn't look into the thing.","start":2422.232,"stop":2452.199,"duration":29.97},{"text":"The shipper and the -- the passenger have no chance, the seaman by reason of the discipline was thought in Mahnich to have no genuine opportunity to do so.","start":2452.199,"stop":2462.974,"duration":10.78},{"text":"Now, we come to Sieracki and although there is this difference and although there is no privity of contract between the shipowner and the injured repairman -- the injured stevedore employee, still by analogy to MacPherson and Buick, the privity of contract is ignored and we go on.","start":2462.974,"stop":2485.982,"duration":23.01},{"text":"But still again all, it is the implication of a warranty of seaworthiness for the voyage.","start":2485.982,"stop":2493.278,"duration":7.3},{"text":"It is in the course of the loading.","start":2493.278,"stop":2496.413,"duration":3.14},{"text":"Next in order in this Court comes Pope & Talbot against Hawn.","start":2496.413,"stop":2502.011,"duration":5.6},{"text":"Now, that was a case where with the complete crew aboard, the vessel was almost through loading to go out -- the

fittings.","start":2502.011,"stop":2524.153,"duration":22.14},{"text":"It's a type of stevedoring work but at the same time it's a type of repair work.","start":2524.153,"stop":2529.008,"duration":4.86},{"text":"He was injured, held that the warranty extended to him.","start":2529.008,"stop":2534.182,"duration":5.17},{"text":"Now, that seems obvious.","start":2534.182,"stop":2536.409,"duration":2.23},{"text":"The vessel was loading for the voyage.","start":2536.409,"stop":2540.404,"duration":3.99},{"text":"The shipowner had represented

that point that there hadn't been a warranty of seaworthiness to every pound of cargo that had been on laden.","start":2547.8,"stop":2555.22,"duration":7.42},{"text":"So it's held that the warranty extends also to this carpenter who comes aboard.","start":2555.22,"stop":2559.569,"duration":4.35},{"text":"Nothing is more natural, but notice it's in the course of the voyage.","start":2559.569,"stop":2563.642,"duration":4.07},{"text":"Next we have Alaska Steamship and Peterson.","start":2563.642,"stop":2569.23,"duration":5.59},{"text":"This is again loading or unloading for the voyage.","start":2569.23,"stop":2572.401,"duration":3.17},{"text":"The stevedore is allowed by the ship to bring aboard a defective snatch block instead of requiring him to use vessel's snatch block, they let him use their own.","start":2572.401,"stop":2581.84,"duration":9.44},{"text":"This was defective, Peterson was injured, but it is once more a breach of a warranty implied of seaworthiness for the voyage.","start":2581.84,"stop":2593.07,"duration":11.23},{"text":"Now, Rogers is of course the same.","start":2593.07,"stop":2597.107,"duration":4.04},{"text":"Now, we had it last term, again, in connection with Skovgaard and the Tungus.","start":2597.107,"stop":2604.67,"duration":7.56},{"text":"There again, the injury was in the course of the

that there may be a recovery on account of breach of an implied warranty of seaworthiness not for a voyage but at some other time.","start":2614.16,"stop":2631.946,"duration":17.79},{"text":"Now my

the grave yard.","start":2631.946,"stop":2652.135,"duration":20.19},{"text":"He appears to make an exception to take care of certain cases on account of some kind of major structural repairs.","start":2652.135,"stop":2660.601,"duration":8.47},{"text":"Well, of course any such major structural repairs are obviously not in the course of a voyage, but the thing it seems to me that the Court should address itself to instead of looking at the tasks of the workmen, to look at what is the representation and warranty of the shipowner.","start":2660.601,"stop":2679.132,"duration":18.53},{"text":"Now clearly, in the case of Mr. West, and the Mary Austin here, there was no representation by the shipowner that the vessel was

seaworthiness, it seems to me, which is real seaworthiness, worthy to go to sea.","start":2719.808,"stop":2727.246,"duration":7.44},{"text":"This is what is meant by the warranty of seaworthiness where passengers and where shippers are concerned.","start":2727.246,"stop":2733.738,"duration":6.49},{"text":"Now, Mr. Freedman not unnaturally says, “Let us imply a warranty of seaworthiness,”
