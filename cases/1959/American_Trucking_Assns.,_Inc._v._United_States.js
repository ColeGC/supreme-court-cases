lines.","start":444.118,"stop":459.682,"duration":15.56},{"text":"It also found that if the permit was denied, General Motors would not use the appellant service but would institute proprietary

facilities immediately adjacent to the General Motors' plant.","start":488.877,"stop":497.645,"duration":8.77},{"text":"It shows that none of the other available common carriers could have dedicated their service to General Motors because that would have been inconsistent with their common carrier calling.","start":497.645,"stop":507.398,"duration":9.75},{"text":"It shows also that General Motors' competitors have the advantages of this same type of service in the form of two of the contractors, who -- who are appellants in this case, namely, it shows that BMH, a contract carrier, served Ford and that or rather hardly served Ford and that BMH had been serving Studebaker.","start":507.398,"stop":528.022,"duration":20.62},{"text":"So we submit that so far as the question of restriction is concern, there is nothing to appellants' case.","start":528.022,"stop":533.595,"duration":5.57},{"text":"I'm not going to labor the argument about the dual operations, particularly, the Government even concedes the Commission was right on that.","start":533.595,"stop":540.992,"duration":7.4},{"text":"Essentially, the Commission made three findings there.","start":540.992,"stop":543.49,"duration":2.5},{"text":"They found that -- that based on the prior record, PMT service had been completely -- without any charge of discrimination, it found that there was not much chance of any discrimination here anyway since it was to serve by the single shipper, but the primary thing is that it confined -- required PMT as an incident to securing this contract carrier authority to give up all of its rights to carry the same commodities as a common carrier, so that absolutely, there was no chance of any violation of Section 210 because of its dual operation question.","start":543.49,"stop":580.449,"duration":36.96},{"text":"One other question, we submit too that the Commission or that the lower court, the majority of the lower court were purely correct when they held that the appellants here, either the individual truck lines or the associations had no standing to sue because they were -- were not parties in interest and they were not damaged by the administrative action.","start":580.449,"stop":602.53,"duration":22.08},{"text":"Essentially, this is a jug in a manger action by the American Trucking Association and some of its members to keep the railroads from engaging in even a limited form of -- of carrier -- motor carrier transportation.","start":602.53,"stop":615.406,"duration":12.88},{"text":"The -- the complaint is completely devoid of any allegation of injury to the appellants.","start":615.406,"stop":621.532,"duration":6.13},{"text":"And the Commission's decision shows clearly that there was none.","start":621.532,"stop":624.652,"duration":3.12},{"text":"Thus, from the decisions of the Commission, it appears that this traffic had already -- had long been moving by rail and would continue to move by rail.","start":624.652,"stop":632.472,"duration":7.82},{"text":"And it shows also that even if the applications were denied, General Motors would not use these appellant services but would use these other services or bring in its own.","start":632.472,"stop":642.127,"duration":9.65},{"text":"And another indication that there was no real injury is the fact that after appellants had -- had made a motion for temporary restraining order, which was denied, they, thereafter, abandoned their claims for an interlocutory injunction.","start":642.127,"stop":656.89,"duration":14.76},{"text":"And we submit that on the authority of the Santa Fe case, which is mentioned in our brief and which was affirmed by this Court a few years ago, under this set of facts, the appellants really had no standing to maintain its action.","start":656.89,"stop":669.873,"duration":12.98},{"text":"There, the shoe was on the other foot.","start":669.873,"stop":672.862,"duration":2.99},{"text":"In that case, certain railroads attempted to set aside an order of the Commission which had permitted the merger of -- of several motor carriers under a stronger financial hat.","start":672.862,"stop":683.543,"duration":10.68},{"text":"And the Court held there that something more than a common desire for the enforcement of the law must be present but that there must be some actual injury, and it -- it distinguished such cases as the Alton Railroad case upon which the appellants rely because there, it said that there was a right of the carrier to try to stop and set aside a commission order approving a grant of authority to -- of new operations to a competing form of transportation where it threatened the traffic.","start":683.543,"stop":713.863,"duration":30.32},{"text":"And here, as I try to make it clear, there is no competitive threat to the traffic of these appellants arising from this order.","start":713.863,"stop":721.646,"duration":7.78},{"text":"Now, this authority has been in effect ever since November 1958.","start":721.646,"stop":728.011,"duration":6.37},{"text":"This operation has been conducted under -- for that considerable length of time.","start":728.011,"stop":732.171,"duration":4.16},{"text":"The Commission has definitely found it to be in the public interest.","start":732.171,"stop":736.472,"duration":4.3},{"text":"It has tried to weigh the requirements under Section 209 (b) which are -- that the -- as amended, which says that the Commission

what it tried to do here.","start":755.632,"stop":757.217,"duration":1.59},{"text":"It -- it attempted to accommodate the shipping -- shippers' needs without causing undue harm to the competing forms

it made these two observations.","start":1313.918,"stop":1317.072,"duration":3.15},{"text":"First, it said it couldn't impose the usual restrictions in this case because if it did so, it would be authorizing common rather than contract carriage, which had been applied for.","start":1317.072,"stop":1329.133,"duration":12.06},{"text":"Now, as we point out on brief, the Commission hasn't been nearly as solicitous when independent motor carriers had been before it.","start":1329.133,"stop":1336.527,"duration":7.39},{"text":"It has often issued one type of authority when another has been requested.","start":1336.527,"stop":1341.34,"duration":4.81},{"text":"And as we also point out and the Commission agrees with us in its brief, at page 21 of its brief, that there's little distinction between common and contract carriers in the automobile transport field.","start":1341.34,"stop":1352.279,"duration":10.94},{"text":"Plus the Commission here could well have authorized PMT to provide a common carrier service and having done that, it could've imposed restrictions designed to limit that service to auxiliary and supplemental operations.","start":1352.279,"stop":1365.084,"duration":12.81},{"text":"Now, they admitted that kind of authority would not have been acceptable with General Motors.","start":1365.084,"stop":1370.434,"duration":5.35},{"text":"And in the final analysis, we contend that the Commission simply bowed its neck and did what General Motors wanted it to do.","start":1370.434,"stop":1377.478,"duration":7.04},{"text":"Now, the other reason which the Commission gives to justify its departure from its usual policy, despite its finding that no unusual circumstances had been shown, is really all we're doing here is simply allowing the Southern Pacific Railroad to transport the use of motor trucks in the service, to transport automobiles where it has formally used its railcars.","start":1377.478,"stop":1400.736,"duration":23.26},{"text":"Well now, this philosophy I think will completely emasculate the congressional policy that's involved here.","start":1400.736,"stop":1407.612,"duration":6.88},{"text":"After all, if all the railroad has to do in order to get motor truck authority, all along its line, is simply to show that it's presently moving traffic in railcars and every railroad in the country is in business as a motor carrier to points all over its system without any restrictions at all.","start":1407.612,"stop":1425.737,"duration":18.13},{"text":"And every railroad in the -- railroad in the country could pick its largest shippers and its choicest traffic and simply go into the motor carrier business.","start":1425.737,"stop":1433.738,"duration":8},{"text":"Now, if that's all this Congressional policy needs, there's been a lot of water over the dam over something that

that.","start":1444.06,"stop":1446.745,"duration":2.68},{"text":"Really, in the final analysis, here's what the Commissions order tells the railroads of the country.","start":1446.745,"stop":1452.388,"duration":5.64},{"text":"It says first, if you can prove on all the ATA case, that the independent motor carriers in the area in which you want to perform unrestricted trucking, are dodging their responsibilities, failing to provide inadequate service, come in and file a common carrier application.","start":1452.388,"stop":1468.815,"duration":16.43},{"text":"And on the basis of that case, we will be able to give you unrestricted rights.","start":1468.815,"stop":1473.712,"duration":4.9},{"text":"But it says on the other hand, if you can't show that the independents are -- are doing a poor job, if they appear to be rendering inadequate service, why come in and ask for contract carrier rights and we will give you those unrestricted, because we wouldn't want to attach restrictions to those kind of rights because then we -- making common carriers out of you and we shouldn't do that.","start":1473.712,"stop":1495.171,"duration":21.46},{"text":"And as we read this case, the Commission in a very real sense has simply consigned the congressional policy here in the limbo and certainly not because of any change in the law at all.","start":1495.171,"stop":1506.945,"duration":11.77},{"text":"Now, the argument is made on brief and it's going to be made across before the Court that in reality, the authority has -- has been granted is restricted.","start":1506.945,"stop":1518.353,"duration":11.41},{"text":"PMT and General Motors and their joint brief, even go so far as to say that the territorial limitation imposed by the Commission amounts to an auxiliary and supplemental restriction.","start":1518.353,"stop":1529.18,"duration":10.83},{"text":"But we think that the term is too well-known in the court decisions and we think it means that the operations have to be tied in with the rail service.","start":1529.18,"stop":1540.979,"duration":11.8},{"text":"And for that reason, we think that claim by General Motors and PMT simply doesn't hold water.","start":1540.979,"stop":1547.463,"duration":6.48},{"text":"But further of what the Commission refers to as a territorial limitation is a restriction or not, we certainly submit that it does not and cannot satisfy the congressional policy against the lying railroads, complete freedom to get into the trucking business, because that's what this is in the final analysis.","start":1547.463,"stop":1565.289,"duration":17.83},{"text":"We think that the two reasons.","start":1565.289,"stop":1566.731,"duration":1.44},{"text":"First, we think -- think it because of common logic.","start":1566.731,"stop":1570.047,"duration":3.32},{"text":"And next, we believe the Commission's own decision support this view.","start":1570.047,"stop":1576.114,"duration":6.07},{"text":"I think the Court will take judicial notice of the fact that the railroads of the country and the aggregate serve just about every point of any commercial importance at all.","start":1576.114,"stop":1585.517,"duration":9.4},{"text":"Now, if merely limiting them, the points on their line complies with the congressional policy here, are then the independent motor carriers of the country are going to find themselves confronted throughout all the railroad system, with railroads operating its railroads on the one hand and an unrestricted truck service on the other.","start":1585.517,"stop":1607.656,"duration":22.14},{"text":"Though there'll be a few hamlets here and there, small towns that aren't important enough to want being on any railroad line, where the trucks may not encounter that kind of dual competition, but they would be very small and very few and far between.","start":1607.656,"stop":1625.068,"duration":17.41},{"text":"That's the logic of it.","start":1625.068,"stop":1626.66,"duration":1.59},{"text":"Now, the Commission itself long ago has -- in 1946 and it's quite my decision, completely refuted the contention that's made here.","start":1626.66,"stop":1636.713,"duration":10.05},{"text":"Then they referred that to the earlier Barker decision and they said this and I'm quoting, “There also appears to have developed a tendency in rail motor acquisition proceedings to treat the Barker case restrictions as geographical or territorial only in their intent rather than substantive limitations upon the character of the service.”","start":1636.713,"stop":1658.812,"duration":22.1},{"text":"And there, the Commission emphasized that word, “service” which might be rendered by a railroad or its affiliate under any acquired right.","start":1658.812,"stop":1667.249,"duration":8.44},{"text":"Now, in our brief here at pages 33 and 34, we've

may, I just like to repeat here the most significant portion of the last paragraph which is quoted in our brief.","start":1678.304,"stop":1685.606,"duration":7.3},{"text":"The Commission said this, “It is clear that any tendency to treat the Barker case as an approval of future rail motor operations which should be unrestricted except territorially, ignores the clear declaration that certain types of operations are disapproved, wherever conducted, and must bring from a misinterpretation of the intent of the reports therein,” referring back to its Barker decision.","start":1685.606,"stop":1711.226,"duration":25.62},{"text":"In its brief here, the Commission makes no mention, whatever, of the White Line case.","start":1711.226,"stop":1715.818,"duration":4.59},{"text":"In their joint brief, PMT and General Motors however, we think by quoting out of context attempt to leave the impression that the Commission was endorsing the idea that a territorial limitation was all it was needed to conform to Congressional policy.","start":1715.818,"stop":1729.867,"duration":14.05},{"text":"Now that, of course, is really the very antithesis of the Commission's conclusion reached in the White Line case.","start":1729.867,"stop":1737.206,"duration":7.34},{"text":"The Commission report here says that it reserves the right to impose in the future and I quote, “Any conditions or restrictions which may then appear to be necessary or desirable in the public interest.”","start":1737.206,"stop":1750.365,"duration":13.16},{"text":"You will note even in that reservation, they don't refer to auxiliary and supplemental restrictions.","start":1750.365,"stop":1755.551,"duration":5.19},{"text":"Now, certainly, this reservation isn't a restriction as of now.","start":1755.551,"stop":1760.888,"duration":5.34},{"text":"And in addition, if the Commission is correct in saying in its report here that it can impose the usual auxiliary and supplemental restriction because to do so, what convert these operations from contract to common carriage which is not what the applicant wants, then obviously, if they can't do it now, they can't do it anytime in the future either.","start":1760.888,"stop":1782.726,"duration":21.84},{"text":"So the reservation is a meaningless, we think, phrase.","start":1782.726,"stop":1787.266,"duration":4.54},{"text":"So we believe in the final analysis entirely aside from the technical semantical distinctions and what the Commission has done here is to authorize unrestricted operations by this railroad subsidiary without any finding that such operations are justified because of exceptional circumstances and indeed in the teeth of a finding just of contrary.","start":1787.266,"stop":1808.73,"duration":21.46},{"text":"In so doing, we think that Commission's decision ignores a clearly discernible guidepost which this Court laid down for it in its ATA decision.","start":1808.73,"stop":1818.305,"duration":9.58},{"text":"I see that my share of the time is moving along.","start":1818.305,"stop":1821.852,"duration":3.55},{"text":"If I may, I'd like to come next to the issue of standing to sue here.","start":1821.852,"stop":1827.68,"duration":5.83},{"text":"That issue is raised only by PMT and General Motors, a permission has never challenged their standing to sue.","start":1827.68,"stop":1836.107,"duration":8.43},{"text":"The basis for the argument seems to be this.","start":1836.107,"stop":1838.989,"duration":2.88},{"text":"In the proceedings before the Commission, General Motors steadfastly took the position that no matter what happened, even if the application were denied, none of these independent motor carriers who were protesting the application are going to get any of its business.","start":1838.989,"stop":1856.949,"duration":17.96},{"text":"Now, of course, it's either the court below gave a good bit of credence to that and certainly the appellees do, the words of the General Motors' witnesses are really treated almost as the laws of the Medes and the Persians.","start":1856.949,"stop":1870.364,"duration":13.41},{"text":"And the argument is made that if you're never going to get any business in General Motors issue now, then you can -- and suffered any damage.","start":1870.364,"stop":1877.767,"duration":7.4},{"text":"You haven't suffered any damage, even though you have no standing to sue.","start":1877.767,"stop":1882.756,"duration":4.99},{"text":"It's interesting to know that the District Court's majority here which did accept this argument said that if the complaint had been found by qualified party in interest, all of the plaintiffs would've had the right to intervene.","start":1882.756,"stop":1900.036,"duration":17.28},{"text":"Now, we simply can't imagine who would be qualified parties and interest and entitled to test the validity of this Commission decision if it weren't the protest in carriers before the Commission, if not them, then who?","start":1900.036,"stop":1914.789,"duration":14.75},{"text":"And what the decision really does in this area is to insulate from review any order of the Commission, provided only that the supporting shipper who was before the Commission, of our General Motors here says, “I'm not going to give you any business no matter what happens.”","start":1914.789,"stop":1931.829,"duration":17.04},{"text":"And the argument would be made subsequently when review were sought that well, you were told you wouldn't get any business and so there's no reason for you to go to court because you haven't been damaged.","start":1931.829,"stop":1944.888,"duration":13.06},{"text":"I supposed General Motors here instead of taking the attitude it did had said that if the application were denied, some of the protestants would be used by it, then I think presumably, these same protestors would've then had the right to go to Court, because that would've been considered to be damaged -- damaged and therefore, given them a standing to sue.","start":1944.888,"stop":1969.801,"duration":24.91},{"text":"So that in a real sense, the attitude of
