tuberculosis.","start":67.161,"stop":88.591,"duration":21.43},{"text":"The facts basically were these.","start":88.591,"stop":91.763,"duration":3.17},{"text":"This man was aboard ship as an engineer, the weather was rough, and the emergency arose whereby he had to attend to refrigeration engine in the forward portion of the vessel.","start":91.763,"stop":103.993,"duration":12.23},{"text":"Safety

penicillin, treated him for this heavy cough, heavy cold.","start":171.952,"stop":184.318,"duration":12.37},{"text":"When he hit the Port of Miami, he thought all he had was a cold from being washed

doctor.","start":208.14,"stop":215.002,"duration":6.86},{"text":"Now, his family doctor had examined him regularly, no less than five or six times in the year before the accident.","start":215.002,"stop":221.959,"duration":6.96},{"text":"X-rays of this man's chest take him as recently as too much before he fell, had fail to disclose any tuberculosis.","start":221.959,"stop":230.69,"duration":8.73},{"text":"On re-examination of this X-rays, however, there was found to be a small infiltration, a small healed tubercular lesion that was

lung.","start":261.166,"stop":267.948,"duration":6.78},{"text":"The medical testimony was that a blow to the chest can caused an inactive tuberculosis to become active full-blown and progress rapidly.","start":267.948,"stop":281.259,"duration":13.31},{"text":"Now, what test then is to be applied to determine whether or not the blow to the chest plus this other factual background that I've given to you, aggravated or activated his preexisting dormant tuberculosis.","start":281.259,"stop":299.905,"duration":18.65},{"text":"The cases are uniform, and there is no question as to the law.","start":299.905,"stop":304.122,"duration":4.22},{"text":"The test is that probability is the chest, namely, did the blow to the chest probably aggravate his preexisting condition?","start":304.122,"stop":314.657,"duration":10.53},{"text":"Now, there are three possible test that might be applied.","start":314.657,"stop":318.703,"duration":4.05},{"text":"We might use the test of absolute certainty.","start":318.703,"stop":322.166,"duration":3.46},{"text":"The plaintiff is not required and no plaintiff has ever been required to prove any such thing with absolute certainty.","start":322.166,"stop":329.665,"duration":7.5},{"text":"The test might be possibility and possibility is not a sufficient test, so the test is probability.","start":329.665,"stop":336.505,"duration":6.84},{"text":"Now, then, what proof do we have that meets this test of probability?","start":336.505,"stop":341.798,"duration":5.29},{"text":"We have two doctors.","start":341.798,"stop":344.356,"duration":2.56},{"text":"One of which, eminently, well-qualified

condition.","start":355.895,"stop":364.012,"duration":8.12},{"text":"Another doctor stated not -- not less than three times, and we've quoted that in our reply brief, that the blow probably aggravated his preexisting condition.","start":364.012,"stop":376.769,"duration":12.76},{"text":"Now, I suggest that the proof presented to the trial court meets the test of probability and that the jury was

doctors.","start":405.38,"stop":411.961,"duration":6.58},{"text":"And I suggest that this Fifth Circuit opinion require the plaintiff to prove, not probability but certainty, because in reading the

matter that should be mentioned.","start":446.92,"stop":450.07,"duration":3.15},{"text":"The plaintiff, when he felt, sustained certain admitted injuries even a part from his tuberculosis, namely, the headache that he had for a while that a blow to the chest, the scrape marks, the bruises that he had, the injuries to the leg, to the hip.","start":450.07,"stop":465.155,"duration":15.08},{"text":"How can the Fifth Circuit Court disregard the admitted proof of positive injuries?","start":465.155,"stop":471.904,"duration":6.75},{"text":"In the defendant's brief, they don't even bother to try to meet this because it can not be met.","start":471.904,"stop":480.249,"duration":8.35},{"text":"They -- the Fifth Circuit Court, by this opinion, has, in effect, attempted to reevaluate the evidence and supplant its evaluation of the evidence for that of the jury.","start":480.249,"stop":492.628,"duration":12.38},{"text":"And I suggest to that appellate courts have enough to do without reevaluating

level, this matter from beginning to end was bitterly contested right down to the wire on every witness on practically every question.","start":517.187,"stop":532.03,"duration":14.84},{"text":"And it is true that the jury could have reached the same result that the Fifth Circuit reached.","start":532.03,"stop":537.672,"duration":5.64},{"text":"But fortunately, for the plaintiff, it did not.","start":537.672,"stop":541.236,"duration":3.56},{"text":"On appeal, the plaintiff is entitled to all of the favorable testimony and inferences in its favor, and counsel for the defendant cannot state that any of the facts I've stated are not supported by the record.","start":541.236,"stop":557.237,"duration":16},{"text":"Now, the Fifth Circuit, in its opinion, has failed to follow even its own opinions.","start":557.237,"stop":565.952,"duration":8.72},{"text":"Under the -- the test under the Jones Act, for example, as they have stated it in the Liberty Mutual Company case, 171 F.2d 723, is the same that I have enunciated, namely, a question whether the disability was approximately caused or materially contributed to by his accidental injury.","start":565.952,"stop":585.756,"duration":19.8},{"text":"Now, in that case, as in this case, the witnesses' statements on cross-examination are somewhat inconsistent but said the Fifth Circuit.","start":585.756,"stop":594.35,"duration":8.59},{"text":"In the Liberty Mutual case, the witnesses' inconsistent statements present a question for jury, it is the function of the jury to

injuries.","start":623.746,"stop":628.053,"duration":4.31},{"text":"So on cross-examination, the doctor said, “The injury could have been caused by the accident or lifting,” and he could not tell

facts.","start":703.806,"stop":730.977,"duration":27.17},{"text":"And I think it's obvious that the only reason we are here today is because the petitioner now seeks to have this Court sit a

here.","start":755.972,"stop":768.872,"duration":12.9},{"text":"This gentleman was about 40 years old.","start":768.872,"stop":771.672,"duration":2.8},{"text":"He was hired by the Inter-Caribbean

seaman.","start":791.868,"stop":798.316,"duration":6.45},{"text":"Mr. Sentilles, on this occasion, as the manager of the vessel, signed himself on and placed himself on the ship as a member of the crew.","start":798.316,"stop":810.285,"duration":11.97},{"text":"This, of course, was done without any opportunity for the company to have a physical examination of the man or to go through the ordinary and customary pre-sign on investigations and examinations that often occur when seaman first go to sea for a shipping company.","start":810.285,"stop":830.259,"duration":19.97},{"text":"Mr. Sentilles is being in charged of the vessel, in charged the operations' bypass such a procedure with himself.","start":830.259,"stop":840.239,"duration":9.98},{"text":"Now, after this accident, it became apparent for the first time through the histories that he gave to positions both prior practice and in the hospital that he had a most remarkable history, remarkable in that it was right down the line consistent with a slowly developing progressive tubercular condition in the very area that he seeks to him liability upon this defendant for.","start":840.239,"stop":873.32,"duration":33.08},{"text":"It is shown by the record that for a period of at least six to eight months, Mr. Sentilles had persistent nights which -- persistent at a recurring colds that he was unable to shake off, a deep and persistent hoarseness, a general tired feeling which the doctors refer to his malice and most significantly for some eight years prior Mr.

and the words and then the testimony of his family doctor.","start":905.643,"stop":917.638,"duration":12},{"text":"And I think that the Court will find also in a reference to the record that upon retrospect and upon examination by qualified tubercular man, the X-ray's in 1950 and in 1952, before this alleged incident in 1953, showed a developing progressing tubercular condition in the lung.","start":917.638,"stop":940.667,"duration":23.03},{"text":"Now, it's true that the family position, an admitted general practitioner without much experience and diagnostic procedures for tuberculosis did not read these films in 1950 and 1952 as reflecting tuberculosis.","start":940.667,"stop":958.122,"duration":17.45},{"text":"But it is highly significant that the experts and the merchant marine hospitals in New Orleans, the tuberculosis men, the chest men when they saw these films and examined the X-rays in conjunction with the man's history and statement and with the entire record before them, found an enlargement and a constantly progressive development being reflected in these films.","start":958.122,"stop":982.726,"duration":24.6},{"text":"It is highly significant also that one of the own -- one of the plaintiffs and the petitioners own witnesses, and I might interject here that the defendant and respondent was at the trial and still is content to rest its case on this issue with the plaintiff's own testimony.","start":982.726,"stop":1000.959,"duration":18.23},{"text":"There is no medical testimony was adduced at the trial by the
