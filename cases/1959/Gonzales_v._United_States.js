Appeal.","start":59.548,"stop":97.107,"duration":37.56},{"text":"He had the opportunity to answer for the first time and then the Department of Justice had already formed this position against him.","start":97.107,"stop":105.287,"duration":8.18},{"text":"The second question is whether or not he was denied procedural due process of law before the Appeal Board by the withholding of the report

be reached if the Court does not decide the first two in our favor, namely, whether or not the District Court denied procedural due process of law and disallowing the request of the petitioner by subpoena duces tecum to command the production of the hearing officer's report which was for the purpose of establishing that he had been denied procedural due process of law before the Appeal Board in several respects and the withholding of the hearing officer's report, and then, also the quashing of the subpoena duces tecum commanding the production of the FBI reports which had been summarized

was before the local board, offered to prove that he was a minister notwithstanding the fact that he had discontinued the full-time ministry, but he never got around to the point of giving any evidence, whatever, for the purposes for which he want therefore, namely, because when he appeared there, the Board told him that they had already considered this matter and have their minds made up and the case was going to the Board of Appeal.","start":310.449,"stop":340.409,"duration":29.96},{"text":"So, he got no opportunity to

disputed.","start":346.159,"stop":354.478,"duration":8.32},{"text":"And the case on that day, that very day of hearing was forwarded to the Board of Appeal and here, it's significant to note that

Board had overruled.","start":354.478,"stop":376.571,"duration":22.09},{"text":"But on the very day, and I call your attention to a paper that's not printed but which appears in the Exhibit 1, the

registrant to file some sort of a written statement before the papers go out.","start":419.934,"stop":429.987,"duration":10.05},{"text":"But since they told him that he could appeal orally, and he did so appeal when he had no opportunity to complete his testimony before them are offered when he went there to prove, there was no chance for him to file any statement on appeal and also, there was no chance for him to make any complaint about this memoranda of August the 17th of 1956 that we complain about where they take up and copy a letter that was written to the Board back in three or four years earlier when he was a full-time pioneer and make it appear that he had been given a full hearing on the ministry that day and that's set forth on page 7 in my brief, in Footnote

person.","start":494.788,"stop":509.037,"duration":14.25},{"text":"My point is that when he took this appeal in this state of affairs to the Board of Appeal, the whole file was sent to the Board of
