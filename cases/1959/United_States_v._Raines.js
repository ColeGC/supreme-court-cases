discretion.","start":380.593,"stop":407.219,"duration":26.63},{"text":"The fourth ground, which is the basis for this appeal, was that the portion of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 providing for an

District Court said in considering the constitutional question, said this, “We must close our mind to the allegations of the complaint in the instant case.”","start":437.777,"stop":448.259,"duration":10.48},{"text":"The court then stated that the question presented was whether the Civil Rights Act of 1957 was broad enough to permit the United States to bring suits against private persons not acting under color of law.","start":448.259,"stop":463.15,"duration":14.89},{"text":"The court justified this approach for the case, that the constitutionality of a statute must be tested on the basis of facts actually presented but rather on the basis of hypothetical facts, by saying this, and I quote from the court's opinion, “It is not

it.”","start":463.15,"stop":496.126,"duration":32.98},{"text":"The District Court then proceeded to weave its own net, much -- much larger than this language of the statute justifies, much broader

party.","start":556.527,"stop":578.097,"duration":21.57},{"text":"This is a civil action to which the United States is a party.","start":578.097,"stop":581.731,"duration":3.63},{"text":"The order dismissing the complaint was a final order.","start":581.731,"stop":585.191,"duration":3.46},{"text":"The holding of the District Court and the exclusive basis for its decision was, “That Section 1971 (c) of Title 42 is beyond the jurisdiction of Congress and unconstitutional.”","start":585.191,"stop":603.352,"duration":18.16},{"text":"What then is the contention of the appellees?","start":603.352,"stop":606.839,"duration":3.49},{"text":"They contend that because the United States in its jurisdictional statement, filed with the court, has injected another question into the case, that the court therefore, does not have jurisdiction.","start":606.839,"stop":619.022,"duration":12.18},{"text":"The Government did not, in fact, inject any new question into this case.","start":619.022,"stop":624.036,"duration":5.01},{"text":"To be sure, we contend that the District Court's decision was -- rested on an erroneous construction of the statute, but that does not and cannot deprive this Court of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.","start":624.036,"stop":637.329,"duration":13.29},{"text":"The purpose of the statute is to make sure that any decision holding a federal statute unconstitutional is reviewed quickly by this Court.","start":637.329,"stop":647.643,"duration":10.31},{"text":"It is irrelevant for purposes of jurisdiction.","start":647.643,"stop":652.071,"duration":4.43},{"text":"How erroneous the court's construction of the statute was or how unnecessary it may have been for the court to reach and decide a constitutional question?","start":652.071,"stop":660.96,"duration":8.89},{"text":"What is relevant and crucial is the holding of the District Court.","start":660.96,"stop":666.808,"duration":5.85},{"text":"If it is a decision holding that an act of Congress unconstitutional in a civil action in which the United States is a party, then a direct appeal to this Court clearly lies.","start":666.808,"stop":678.634,"duration":11.83},{"text":"This case therefore, we believe, comes directly within the expressed terms of Section 1252.","start":678.634,"stop":687.596,"duration":8.96},{"text":"Before dealing with the constitutional question decided by the court, I'd like to refer briefly to an argument stressed by counsel for appellees in their brief.","start":687.596,"stop":699.829,"duration":12.23},{"text":"Counsel say that if the appellees engaged in the practices alleged in the complaint, that they would have been guilty of violating the laws of Georgia.","start":699.829,"stop":711.006,"duration":11.18},{"text":"Therefore, it is contended that even though the State registrars and the deputy registrars refuse to permit fully qualified Negroes to vote because of race or color that the State of Georgia did not deny citizens the right to vote on account of race or color.","start":711.006,"stop":727.631,"duration":16.63},{"text":"That's what is argued that the acts of the appellees were not the acts of the State within the meaning of the Fifteenth Amendment.","start":727.631,"stop":736.313,"duration":8.68},{"text":"This argument is so specious that I only want to make brief comments about it.","start":736.313,"stop":741.1,"duration":4.79},{"text":"The contention has been made many times, decided many times by this Court.","start":741.1,"stop":747.865,"duration":6.76},{"text":"These decisions are referred to in our reply brief, particularly the comprehensive opinion by Chief Justice White in the Home Telephone & Telegraph Company case.","start":747.865,"stop":757.844,"duration":9.98},{"text":"The gist of these cases is that it is state action when state officers act for and in the name of the State.","start":757.844,"stop":769.231,"duration":11.39},{"text":"Would otherwise, the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution would be meaningless because the State, in order to circumvent, it would merely have to pass laws to provide the Negroes with full equality, the right to vote without discrimination as to race or color, in order to comply with the Federal Constitution and principle, while permitting state officers to disregard in practice these laws with impunity.","start":769.231,"stop":801.649,"duration":32.42},{"text":"Fortunately for our nation, as this Court has many times held, there's no such debility in our constitutional system.","start":801.649,"stop":811.041,"duration":9.39},{"text":"Turning now to the decision of the District Court, as I say, the constitutional provisions -- the statutory provisions are set forth in our brief on pages 2, 3 and 4.","start":811.041,"stop":823.398,"duration":12.36},{"text":"Subsection (a) is a reenactment of a provision of the civil rights statute of 1870.","start":823.398,"stop":832.876,"duration":9.48},{"text":"Subsections (b) and (c) were added by the Civil Rights Act of 1957.","start":832.876,"stop":839.334,"duration":6.46},{"text":"Subsection (a) applies to all elections, both state and federal, and it implements the Fifteenth Amendment.","start":839.334,"stop":850.54,"duration":11.21},{"text":"It prohibits discrimination in the voting process on account of race or color by state action.","start":850.54,"stop":858.948,"duration":8.41},{"text":"Subsection (b) secures the right to vote in federal elections, as guaranteed by Article 1, Sections 4 and 8 of the Constitution.","start":858.948,"stop":868.025,"duration":9.08},{"text":"It protects the right to vote in federal elections, not only against state action, but against individual action unrelated to any governmental responsibility.","start":868.025,"stop":878.244,"duration":10.22},{"text":"Subsection (c) merely gives the United States authority to bring a civil action to enforce either subsection (a) or (b).","start":878.244,"stop":890.762,"duration":12.52},{"text":"In order to reach the conclusion that subsection (c) was unconstitutional, the District Court had to find that subsection (a) was intended to be broader and more inclusive than the Fifteenth Amendment.","start":890.762,"stop":905.309,"duration":14.55},{"text":"Other four reasons why this construction -- strained construction of that statute, I believe, was wrong and I will merely summarize these reasons.","start":905.309,"stop":920.185,"duration":14.88},{"text":"The language of the statute makes it clear that its application was to state action and I'm referring now to subsection (a).","start":920.185,"stop":932.75,"duration":12.57},{"text":"It provides that there shall be no discrimination in voting on account of race or color, “Any constitution, law, custom usage, or a regulation of any state or territory or by or under its authority to the contrary, notwithstanding.”","start":932.75,"stop":950.752,"duration":18},{"text":"The contrasting language of subsection (b) starts out and reaches this way, “No person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, shall intimidate and so forth.”","start":950.752,"stop":965.02,"duration":14.27},{"text":"This distinguishes the two subsections.","start":965.02,"stop":968.191,"duration":3.17},{"text":"Subsection (b) applies only to federal elections after which the power of Congress is not limited by the Fifteenth Amendment and applies to any person, whether acting under color of law or not.","start":968.191,"stop":981.167,"duration":12.98},{"text":"While subsection (a) applies to both state and federal elections and was intended only to implement the Fifteenth Amendment and applies only to persons acting under color of law.","start":981.167,"stop":994.666,"duration":13.5},{"text":"So that I think that the language of the statutes or the -- the language of those sections, make it very clear that the District Court was wrong.","start":994.666,"stop":1004.867,"duration":10.2},{"text":"The second reason makes it perfectly clear that the District Court was wrong is the legislative history or the original Act in 1870, which is fully set forth in our brief.","start":1004.867,"stop":1015.914,"duration":11.05},{"text":"There was no question about it from the legislative history of that Act that this statute was intended to implement the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution.","start":1015.914,"stop":1024.763,"duration":8.85},{"text":"Third reason is that the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 makes it clear that this subsection was to implement the Fifteenth Amendment only.","start":1024.763,"stop":1036.227,"duration":11.46},{"text":"Both the House and the Senate Committee Reports make it clear.","start":1036.227,"stop":1039.233,"duration":3.01},{"text":"The House Committee Report on the bill reproduced a letter from the Attorney General referring to the subsection which said this, “Statute is limited however, to deprivations of voting rights by state offices or other persons purporting to act under color of law.”","start":1039.233,"stop":1058.057,"duration":18.82},{"text":"Throughout the debate on the bill and it was – it was certainly scrutinized at every stage of the legislative process.","start":1058.057,"stop":1066.9,"duration":8.84},{"text":"The legislators in both Houses viewed what – what are now subsections (a) and (c) taken together as implementing the Fifteenth Amendment and that purely private action could not be reached.","start":1066.9,"stop":1080.383,"duration":13.48},{"text":"Fourth is a series – a series of cases in this Court, the most recent of which is Terry against Adams, which gave full force and effect of subsection (a).","start":1080.383,"stop":1091.607,"duration":11.22},{"text":"And in so doing, the Court held that it was adopted by the Congress to implement the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution.","start":1091.607,"stop":1101.465,"duration":9.86},{"text":"We submit, therefore, that the District Court's decision is erroneous because the statute cannot by any reasonable hypothesis, either by its own language or by legislative history or by the decisions of this Court, be construed to apply to wholly private action unrelated to any governmental activity.","start":1101.465,"stop":1126.73,"duration":25.27},{"text":"But in any event, even if it could be assumed by some stretch of the imagination that the court was correct in its conclusion that it could be applied to purely private action, the judgment in this case is wrong.","start":1126.73,"stop":1143.963,"duration":17.23},{"text":"This Court in a long series
