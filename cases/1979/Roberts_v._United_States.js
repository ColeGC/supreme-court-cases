don't think we can be faulted for not raising the issue having -- we never thought about the issue, the implications of the right to remain silent, the Miranda warnings, etcetera when Courts of Appeal are -- appeals are divided on the issue.","start":1523.893,"stop":1539.871,"duration":15.98},{"text":"In fact, that's why we're here today.","start":1539.871,"stop":1542.29,"duration":2.42},{"text":"So, we can't be faulted for not raising at that time and, indeed, the issue only came into the case when the judge, in imposing sentence, said, “That is one of the factors I'm relying upon.”","start":1542.29,"stop":1553.132,"duration":10.84},{"text":"After that, the case went on appeal and we researched the law, presented it to the Court of Appeals, and the case ultimately wound its way here.","start":1553.132,"stop":1566.065,"duration":12.93},{"text":"Now, since the record below was silent, in effect, as to the reasons for the lack of cooperation, other than this Fifth Amendment issue which is clearly there, it was impermissible for the Court to penalize lack of cooperation when lack of cooperation could just as easily have been, as Judge Lombard said in his opinions, from fear of harm, danger to himself, or his family, or other like reasons.","start":1566.065,"stop":1596.27,"duration":30.2},{"text":"In other words, there's no reason to say that failure to cooperate on these facts was because the man was not amenable to rehabilitation.","start":1596.27,"stop":1606.597,"duration":10.33},{"text":"Now, there's a further consideration here, and that is the fact that, in this case, the prosecutor urged consecutive penalties because petitioner failed to cooperate over the entire course of the case.","start":1606.597,"stop":1619.597,"duration":13},{"text":"At appendix 36, he said, “Throughout the long process that has occurred some-June of 1975, when he first came into my office, up to today, he still has refused to cooperate.”","start":1619.597,"stop":1631.344,"duration":11.75},{"text":"Now, at the stage where the defendant was in the prosecutor's office and he refused to cooperate, the defendant was then penalized in part because, at that point, unrepresented by counsel, he didn't confess everything the Government wanted to know, indicate where he got the drugs from and things of that nature, and we think that is clearly impermissible.","start":1631.344,"stop":1653.857,"duration":22.51},{"text":"Secondly, between the -- the indictment and the plea, as we understand it, the defendant has pleaded not guilty.","start":1653.857,"stop":1665.681,"duration":11.82},{"text":"He has no duty to confess, cooperate with the Government.","start":1665.681,"stop":1668.787,"duration":3.11},{"text":"He's Fifth Amendment rights have not been waived in any shape or form and, yet, the defendant was penalized in this case, during this phase of this case also, because he never came and said, “Prosecutor, let -- I want to lay my soul bare to you.”","start":1668.787,"stop":1684.219,"duration":15.43},{"text":"I think that's impermissible.","start":1684.219,"stop":1685.558,"duration":1.34},{"text":"And, in line with the question that Justice Stevens asked, for example, under Grayson, we think a judge could probably say to a defendant “Mr. Defendant, you're going to testify.”","start":1685.558,"stop":1697.358,"duration":11.8},{"text":"The Supreme Court has said, “If you do and do so falsely, and you're convicted, I'm going to take that into account when I impose sentence.”","start":1697.358,"stop":1704.66,"duration":7.3},{"text":"But, we don't think that, prior to the disposition of the case, the defendant can be brought into the courtroom and the judge say to him, “Now, Mr. Defendant, you know, I've heard you haven't cooperated in here.","start":1704.66,"stop":1718.808,"duration":14.15},{"text":"The

that.","start":1721.87,"stop":1723.043,"duration":1.17},{"text":"You haven't indicated who you got your drugs from, and I think that's something that should be done and, if you don't do it, when -- if you're convicted and the sentencing comes about, I'm going to penalize you for that.”","start":1723.043,"stop":1733.763,"duration":10.72},{"text":"I think that is totally impermissible, coercive,
