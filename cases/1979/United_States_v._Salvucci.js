United States, this self-incrimination dilemma can no longer occur in light of the subsequent decision in Simmons v.

riding.","start":537.4,"stop":549.136,"duration":11.74},{"text":"The defendants in Rakas were charged with armed robbery.","start":549.136,"stop":552.168,"duration":3.03},{"text":"If, however, they had been prosecuted and convicted with the unlawful constructive possession of the rifle that was found during the course of the search, it is difficult to see that their suppression claim would be enhanced in the slightest or that the government would be acting in a contradictory fashion by prosecuting on that charge while denying that the defendants could challenge the search under the Fourth Amendment.","start":552.168,"stop":575.802,"duration":23.63}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Levy, could I ask you a question.","start":575.802,"stop":577.657,"duration":1.86},{"text":"Suppose the defendants in this case contended that the checks had been duly endorsed over to him or some such claim pursuant to which he claimed some rightful entitlement to the checks, would he have standing (a) to ask for their return, and (b) to object to the search in the third party's premises?","start":577.657,"stop":600.704,"duration":23.05}]},{"speakerName":"Mark Irving Levy","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, we think if he had standing at all it would not be under the theory of

seizures.","start":638.979,"stop":642.508,"duration":3.53}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"So your argument doesn't depend at all on the contraband character of the items that the police seized?","start":642.508,"stop":648.563,"duration":6.05}]},{"speakerName":"Mark Irving Levy","textObjs":[{"text":"We have a secondary argument that relies on the contraband character,

premises?","start":665.55,"stop":683.204,"duration":17.65}]},{"speakerName":"Mark Irving Levy","textObjs":[{"text":"That's correct, we do not think that would give him standing to challenge the

temporarily as a means of protection but they retained the item longer than was necessary, there might be some grounds for challenging the seizure itself apart from the search that led to the seizure.","start":728.392,"stop":744.402,"duration":16.01},{"text":"One way to see we think the absence of any prosecutorial self-contradiction in the automatic standing situations is to ask whether the defendant would be entitled to pursue applicable remedies other than the exclusionary rule such as a damage action for the assertedly unconstitutional search.","start":744.402,"stop":763.148,"duration":18.75},{"text":"We think it plain that in the hypotheticals I mentioned a few moments ago that the defendant would not be awarded monetary damages since his Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by the illegal search.","start":763.148,"stop":774.066,"duration":10.92},{"text":"For the same reason, he should not be able to invoke the exclusionary rule remedy, and that conclusion is independent of the nature of the charges brought against him.","start":774.066,"stop":784.359,"duration":10.29},{"text":"Thus, we think that the Jones rationale or prosecutorial self-contradiction does not support the continuation of the automatic standing rule.","start":784.359,"stop":793.621,"duration":9.26},{"text":"Apart from the two rationales of Jones itself, the respondent, Salvucci, contends in his brief that the automatic standing rule can be justified by reference to principles of actual standing.","start":793.621,"stop":806.08,"duration":12.46},{"text":"Salvucci argues that a defendant's possessory interest in contraband that is seized entitles him without more to seek suppression of that evidence on the ground that the underlying search violated the Fourth Amendment.","start":806.08,"stop":820,"duration":13.92},{"text":"Salvucci then argues that the charging of a possessory offense necessarily constitutes an admission by the government that the defendant has the requisite possessory interest in the seized contraband to enable him to challenge the search and therefore that the automatic standing rule should be retained to avoid the needless formality of an inquiry into standing at the suppression hearing.","start":820,"stop":843.383,"duration":23.38},{"text":"We submit that this line of argument is entirely unsound.","start":843.383,"stop":847.239,"duration":3.86},{"text":"In our view, as I just discussed with Mr. Justice Stevens, a defendant's proprietary or possessory interest in items seized does not in and of itself entitle him to contest the validity of the search.","start":847.239,"stop":858.895,"duration":11.66},{"text":"Moreover, regardless of the general rule, an asserted possessory interest in contraband, such as stolen property, is totally illegitimate and cannot served as the basis for a Fourth Amendment challenge to either a search or a seizure.","start":858.895,"stop":872.675,"duration":13.78},{"text":"Finally, even if a possessory interest in contraband could suffice to confer standing with respect to the search, the automatic standing rule still would not be warranted, since not all possessory interests should be considered adequate but rather only those interests that establish a sufficient personal nexus between the seized contraband and the defendant.","start":872.675,"stop":894.985,"duration":22.31},{"text":"First, a defendant's proprietary or possessory interest in the items seized does not in itself entitle him to challenge the legality of the search.","start":894.985,"stop":905.248,"duration":10.26},{"text":"Salvucci's argument to the contrary reflects a misconception of the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and unreasonable seizures.","start":905.248,"stop":914.674,"duration":9.43},{"text":"A search is defined under the Fourth Amendment in terms of a governmental intrusion upon a person's legitimate expectation of privacy.","start":914.674,"stop":923.154,"duration":8.48},{"text":"It depends not on a property right but, rather, on a reasonable privacy interest.","start":923.154,"stop":928.74,"duration":5.59},{"text":"A seizure of a physical object, on the other hand, is defined in terms of a governmental interference with the bundle of property rights that attends a person's interest in or relation to that object.","start":928.74,"stop":940.923,"duration":12.18},{"text":"It implicates precisely those property rights that a person has by virtue of his ownership or possession of a given object.","start":940.923,"stop":949.625,"duration":8.7},{"text":"Under this analysis, a proprietary or possessory interest in items seized could give rise to standing to challenge the validity of the seizure, since it was the act of seizure that dispossessed the defendant of his property.","start":949.625,"stop":962.772,"duration":13.15}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
