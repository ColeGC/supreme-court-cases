agreed with appellee's contentions, relying on a line of cases beginning with Tumey against Ohio.","start":241.586,"stop":249.696,"duration":8.11},{"text":"Judge Gasch held that the reimbursement provision of Section 16 (e), and I quote, “Creates a situation in which bias may creep into the decisions of the regional office -- officials who impose civil penalties, that the statute is therefore invalid under the Due Process Clause.”","start":249.696,"stop":266.372,"duration":16.68},{"text":"Now, it's the Government's position that the injunction entered by the District Court is erroneous for three separate reasons.","start":266.372,"stop":272.656,"duration":6.28},{"text":"First, we submit that the due process standards established in cases such as Tumey and Ward versus Village of Monroeville, are applicable with full force only to officials exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions.","start":272.656,"stop":287.028,"duration":14.37},{"text":"Second, even assuming that those standards do apply to the situation in this case, we contend that the court below erred in concluding that the child labor civil penalty scheme creates a significant risk of personal or institutional bias.","start":287.028,"stop":302.49,"duration":15.46},{"text":"And finally, even if the reimbursement provision of Section 16 (e) does violate due process, the court below should have enjoined only the enforcement of that provision.","start":302.49,"stop":312.597,"duration":10.11},{"text":"It should've left the remainder of the civil penalty statute enforced.","start":312.597,"stop":317.001,"duration":4.4},{"text":"Acceptance of any of these three arguments would require reversal of the judgment below.","start":317.001,"stop":322.368,"duration":5.37},{"text":"I'd like to turn first to our broadest contention, which is that the principles recognized in cases such as Tumey and Ward are inapplicable here because the Assistant Regional Administrator in citing an employer for violation of the child labor laws and assessing a proposed penalty is acting as a plaintiff for a prosecutor and not as a judge.","start":322.368,"stop":344.348,"duration":21.98},{"text":"The basic notion that underlies Tumey and Ward is that a litigant is entitled to have his case adjudicated by someone who is free of any substantial likelihood of personal or institutional bias.","start":344.348,"stop":357.979,"duration":13.63},{"text":"The Court in those cases struck down statutory schemes that in the court's words, “Offered a possible temptation to the average men as judge, to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead and not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused.”","start":357.979,"stop":376.75,"duration":18.77},{"text":"Now, we certainly have no quarrel with these principles.","start":376.75,"stop":380.309,"duration":3.56},{"text":"But they cannot be easily transferred, we think, to situations such as this one involving governmental officials exercising prosecutor of rather than adjudicative functions.","start":380.309,"stop":389.532,"duration":9.22}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Geller, let's assume on mine run prosecutor, just an ordinary prosecutor and -- and let's say that his compensation depended entirely upon the fines assessed against people, he was able to get a court to convict.","start":389.532,"stop":408.384,"duration":18.85},{"text":"Would there be any constitutional problem there?","start":408.384,"stop":410.585,"duration":2.2},{"text":"I don't know of any

another aspect of Tumey which involved that and was not challenged by anyone.","start":411.792,"stop":419.358,"duration":7.57},{"text":"In fact, this Court had language in its opinion which I hope to quote to the Court which said that that would be all right.","start":419.358,"stop":425.093,"duration":5.74},{"text":"I don't see any due process from there.","start":425.093,"stop":426.496,"duration":1.4},{"text":"It might be an unwise piece of legislation.","start":426.496,"stop":429.213,"duration":2.72},{"text":"But I -- defendants entitled as a

Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, the -- one of the unfortunate aspects of this case is that there's nothing in the legislative history to explain why the reimbursement provision worked its way into the statute, but I think that that is a very reasonable speculation.","start":507.278,"stop":519.025,"duration":11.75},{"text":"That's correct.","start":519.025,"stop":519.484,"duration":0.46},{"text":"We're not dealing with very large sums of moneys here as I tend to get to in a moment in terms of ESA, the Employment Standard Administration's total budget.","start":519.484,"stop":528.187,"duration":8.7},{"text":"But I think that you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, that in part, it was a desire by Congress to place some of the costs of investigating and prosecuting child labor violations on the perpetuators of those violations.","start":528.187,"stop":543.425,"duration":15.24},{"text":"Now, in our view, the appropriate standard of judicial review should be different when scrutinizing factors that arguably influence the institution, rather than the adjudication of civil or criminal proceedings.","start":543.425,"stop":557.416,"duration":13.99},{"text":"And as I say, I think that's treated well to the traditional -- judicial deference to prosecutorial discretion in bringing cases.","start":557.416,"stop":565.045,"duration":7.63},{"text":"In fact, the Court recognized this crucial distinction of the Tumey case itself, because Tumey involved an Ohio liquor control ordinance which provided that the town mayor who sat as a judge in prosecutions under the ordinance, would receive fees in addition to his salary, if he convicted the defendant, but not if he acquitted the -- the defendant.","start":565.045,"stop":585.182,"duration":20.14},{"text":"The Court found this provision to be unconstitutional.","start":585.182,"stop":588.454,"duration":3.27},{"text":"There is another part of the very same ordinance that was involved in Tumey which provided that 50% of the fines collected were to be placed in a so-called secret service fund, for the purpose of enforcing the prohibition laws and the ordinance specifically provided that 15% of any fine was to go to the deputy marshals, 10% of the fine was to go to the prosecutor, and 15% was to go to the town detectives as compensation for their services in enforcing the liquor laws.","start":588.454,"stop":616.062,"duration":27.61},{"text":"And no one challenged of the legitimacy of these latter provisions of the ordinance in Tumey, involving law enforcement officers rather than adjudicative officers.","start":616.062,"stop":624.712,"duration":8.65},{"text":"The fact the Court expressly stated at the ends of -- end of its opinion that in contrast to the situation with judges, the legislature and I quote, “May and often ought to stimulate prosecutions for crime by offering to those who shall initiate and carry on such prosecutions rewards for thus acting and the interest of the State and the people.”","start":624.712,"stop":646.024,"duration":21.31},{"text":"We think this proposition should govern the case here.","start":646.024,"stop":649.614,"duration":3.59},{"text":"Now, appellee's answer to this argument is essentially to assert that ESA Assistant Regional Administrators function much like judges.","start":649.614,"stop":657.783,"duration":8.17},{"text":"But there's simply nothing in the child labor statute or the accompanying regulations to support that assertion.","start":657.783,"stop":663.757,"duration":5.97},{"text":"Regional Administrators don't preside over hearings or make findings of fact based upon evidence presented in an adversary context.","start":663.757,"stop":672.031,"duration":8.27},{"text":"In issuing a notice of violation or assessing a proposed penalty, they act just like in Assistant United States Attorney, in determining what charges to bring or what relief to seek as in a civil complaint.","start":672.031,"stop":684.107,"duration":12.08},{"text":"And most importantly, perhaps, if the employer disagrees with the Assistant Regional Administrator's determination, either of that, there is a violation or what the penalty should be.","start":684.107,"stop":693.725,"duration":9.62},{"text":"It may seek review and it's entitled to de novo review before the Administrative Law Judge who's unquestionably neutral.","start":693.725,"stop":700.938,"duration":7.21},{"text":"And the Administrative Law Judge's ruling is then subject to judicial review in an Article III court.","start":700.938,"stop":707.863,"duration":6.93},{"text":"It's clear then that an Assistant Regional Administrator in imposing a civil -- a child labor violation and assessing a proposed penalty, does not act as a judge.","start":707.863,"stop":717.54,"duration":9.68},{"text":"And that the standards developed in Tumey and Ward for assuring the neutrality of judges, do not apply.","start":717.54,"stop":723.926,"duration":6.39},{"text":"Our system contains a number of incentives both direct and indirect, to motivate executive branch officials to do their job diligently.","start":723.926,"stop":732.458,"duration":8.53},{"text":"And Section 16 (e) is one such incentive because it stimulates child labor enforcement which Congress prior to the 1974 amendments thought was an area that had been sort of neglected it.","start":732.458,"stop":744.675,"duration":12.22},{"text":"We submit that Congress's efforts to achieve this beneficial result, and as I said, to impose some of the causes of ferreting out child labor violations on those who perpetrate the violations, it's not inconsistent with any notions of fundamental fairness embodied in the Due Process Clause.","start":744.675,"stop":762.479,"duration":17.8},{"text":"Now, if the Court disagrees with this contention and holds that the Assistant Regional Administrator's assessment of civil penalties for child labor violations is subject to the due process standards of Tumey and Ward, we believe that the judgment below must still be reversed because any possibility of bias resulting from the reimbursement provision is wholly insubstantial and remote.","start":762.479,"stop":786.076,"duration":23.6},{"text":"This Court stated in Tumey and indeed Judge Gasch acknowledged that due process does not prohibit the exercise even of judicial power.","start":786.076,"stop":795.772,"duration":9.7},{"text":"When the judicial officer's personal interest is so remote, trifling or insignificant that it may fairly be -- supposed to be incapable of affecting his judgment.","start":795.772,"stop":806.358,"duration":10.59},{"text":"And that describes the situation in this case.First, as I said in response to the Chief Justice's question, unlike in Tumey, here, no labor department official stands to benefit even by $1 personally from any civil penalty assessment.","start":806.358,"stop":821.783,"duration":15.43}]},{"speakerName":"Harry A.
