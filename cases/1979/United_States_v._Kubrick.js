statute of limitations operates to bar an apparently meritorious claim, the result will often strike a court and certainly a plaintiff as harsh, but there are nonetheless sound and long recognized

indicates that Congress enacted and has retained the provision at issue here because it accepts the soundness of those reasons.","start":421.187,"stop":432.955,"duration":11.77},{"text":"Statutes of limitations exist because it is the judgment of legislatures that litigation of stale claims is undesirable.","start":432.955,"stop":441.324,"duration":8.37},{"text":"With the passage of time, reliable relevant evidence may disappear and it is thought unjust to subject an individual suit on even a possibly meritorious claim many years after the incident giving rise to it, when he is likely to find it difficult to collect evidence for his defense.","start":441.324,"stop":459.142,"duration":17.82},{"text":"By barring even meritorious claims after an arbitrary period of time, the statute of limitations induces persons with possible legal claims to investigate and litigate them promptly.","start":459.142,"stop":470.78,"duration":11.64},{"text":"One cannot expect a person to commence an investigation, however, until he knows of something to investigate.","start":470.78,"stop":477.191,"duration":6.41},{"text":"That is the reason that this Court in Urie v.

from the time he first discovered that he had silicosis.","start":477.191,"stop":494.148,"duration":16.96},{"text":"It was not measured from the date many years before in the early symptomless stages as his disease began.","start":494.148,"stop":501.066,"duration":6.92},{"text":"Not until he knew he had the disease could he begin asking whether it could have been avoided by differently designed or

on notice to make such inquiries would penalize the worker for what is called blameless ignorance because he could not know what was inherently unknowable, the harm that was inherently
