person.","start":278.451,"stop":284.175,"duration":5.72},{"text":"Now, it's our position here that no one was harmed after Bates came down and I think it's a clear rule of this Court that when a rule or law is declared unconstitutional, then it has no force or effect, that it is not necessary for any party to take any action and I think it's, in fact, recent doctrine that if the court should change that rule and reverse Bates, for example, that that law could come back into effect.","start":284.175,"stop":313.147,"duration":28.97},{"text":"But, there is no evidence in the record or any

not.","start":323.47,"stop":325.374,"duration":1.9},{"text":"What we tried to present to the court, and it refused to hear it below, was that the machinery was going forward through the offices of the state bar to amend and change the rule consistent with Bates.","start":325.374,"stop":337.84,"duration":12.47},{"text":"That's not a matter that's free of difficulty, I might add and, after I took office, I issued an Attorney General's opinion for the bar which was published and promulgated to all lawyers saying what the impact of Bates was on the rule.","start":337.84,"stop":354.683,"duration":16.84},{"text":"But, there was never any question involved in this case of our Supreme Court not acknowledging supremacy of this Court or ever trying to enforce a rule that was in violation of Bates, but the court below seemed to believe that because our Supreme Court did not, with greater haste, changed the rule subsequent to Bates, that these Attorney's fees should properly be assessed under 1988.","start":354.683,"stop":382.539,"duration":27.86},{"text":"And, it is our position that, with today's practice, that the awarding of attorney's fees against a court or against the chief justice has an inhibiting effect that is just as severe as damages.","start":382.539,"stop":398.114,"duration":15.57},{"text":"Certainly, if the court has to stand, when it is acting as a court in its judicial functions, against the dread of having attorney's fees assessed against it.","start":398.114,"stop":409.603,"duration":11.49},{"text":"The very essence of our system of federalism and constitutional law is at issue because, then, the judge is not really in the position to exercise the kind of independent judgment that he ought to in trying cases and in making judicial rulings.","start":409.603,"stop":427.695,"duration":18.09},{"text":"It's interesting that when the doctrine of the case to which we all look for the best articulation of the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity, Bradley against Fisher, was a case that itself was involved with lawyer discipline.","start":427.695,"stop":442.407,"duration":14.71},{"text":"That was a case, as the Court remembers, when the judge sought to remove a lawyer from the rolls and within his inherent authority to regulate the bar and the court found that he could not be moot for that decision because the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity was such an important one that has been there as long as we have had courts.","start":442.407,"stop":467.033,"duration":24.63},{"text":"The lower district court seems to be saying that the priorities of our State Supreme Court should be its priorities, and its priorities apparently were that our Supreme Court should amend the rule immediately.","start":467.033,"stop":484.196,"duration":17.16},{"text":"Many other states didn't and still have not and our state has now changed that rule, but change it or not, there was no one who was at hazard in Virginia as a result of our not changing the rule because the law in the Bates case applied.","start":484.196,"stop":503.494,"duration":19.3},{"text":"Now, we're not talking about the assessment of cost or filing fees.","start":503.494,"stop":510.587,"duration":7.09},{"text":"Obviously, that is not usually of great moment and, in the Fairmont Creamy case, the court was talking about the need to get it filing fees to continue in business.","start":510.587,"stop":519.404,"duration":8.82},{"text":"We're talking, in this case, of shifting the fee under the 1988 statute that was put there specifically for one purpose, which was to, at the invitation in part of this Court after the ruling in Iliescu, to permit attorney's fees to be shifted not to create some new remedy, not to abolish judicial immunity or the other immunities that existed at the law or in the Constitution.","start":519.404,"stop":547.052,"duration":27.65},{"text":"In fact, the report accompanying the bill said that it did not create any new substantive rights.","start":547.052,"stop":556.239,"duration":9.19},{"text":"So, it is our position that, first of all, even if you look at a statutory construction without conceding a constitutional dimension to the right of judicial immunity that, certainly, in this case, our court is being fined because it had a rule that was part of our governance in Virginia that everyone thought was appropriate and valid and legal.","start":556.239,"stop":583.245,"duration":27.01},{"text":"Our court should not be held to effect a punishment because that rule was there.","start":583.245,"stop":591.416,"duration":8.17},{"text":"Special circumstances should indicate otherwise.","start":591.416,"stop":593.567,"duration":2.15},{"text":"There's no hint of any bad faith on the part of our court.","start":593.567,"stop":596.048,"duration":2.48},{"text":"Secondly, looking at the statute itself and looking at the guidance that we have from several cases - Pierson against Ray and others, this Court has found that if the Congress is going to abolish immunity, that it ought to do it specifically and it ought to manifest that it wanted to do that.","start":596.048,"stop":617.637,"duration":21.59},{"text":"There is no such evidence of that in the reports that accompanied the adoption of 1988.","start":617.637,"stop":624.756,"duration":7.12},{"text":"And, finally, it would be our position that the entitlement to judicial immunity is so at much at the core and at the heart of a function of government that is necessary for our Virginia Supreme Court that the Congress ought not to be able to overrule it even if it wanted to do it.","start":624.756,"stop":648.894,"duration":24.14},{"text":"This, in fact, poses a threat to the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity.","start":648.894,"stop":654.598,"duration":5.7},{"text":"We're not talking about prospective relief.","start":654.598,"stop":658.352,"duration":3.75},{"text":"We're talking about attorney's fees that were awarded for something that happened several years ago, in 1970, when our court adopted this rule.","start":658.352,"stop":667.297,"duration":8.95},{"text":"We're not talking about a recalcitrance or bad faith on the part of the court in any respect, but we are talking about the inherent authority to manage, by rulemaking, the lawyers in Virginia which is an inherent function being in jeopardy and every other ruling of the court being in jeopardy if attorney's fees could be assessed in this case.","start":667.297,"stop":694.447,"duration":27.15},{"text":"It strikes me that, without an independent judiciary, we have to ask what our history be like, who would protect any of us.","start":694.447,"stop":704.256,"duration":9.81},{"text":"It is something that is essential and is needful.","start":704.256,"stop":709.339,"duration":5.08},{"text":"The question of who pays the assessments, whether it's the state or whether it's the court, whether it is an individual does not change the question before the court, and the question before the court simply is what chilling effect this decision, if it is upheld, would have on our jurisprudence, not only in Virginia, in the other states and, in view of Davis against Passman, what effect it would have on other judges, Certainly, in Stump against Sparkman this Court seemed to take the immunity issue to its very limit and to hold that, in that case, the judge could not be answerable for an act he did as a judicial officer.","start":709.339,"stop":760.271,"duration":50.93},{"text":"Certainly, in this case, unlike the characterization in the opposing brief, we don't have a court that was not sympathetic or sensitive to individual rights.","start":760.271,"stop":772.543,"duration":12.27},{"text":"We don't have a court that, in any way, attempted to trench on the constitutional guarantees of this Court and I think the three-judge panel certainly underestimated the difficulty and complexity of making a rule for the entire regulation of the bar consistent with Bates.","start":772.543,"stop":792.955,"duration":20.41},{"text":"It underestimated the nature and extent of the job that was before it, but the Appellees in this case seem to argue that even if the rule had been changed, that that did not ch-- alter the liability for the court in this case to pay attorney's fees.","start":792.955,"stop":814.66,"duration":21.7},{"text":"It's our position that this trenching on judicial immunity is a threat.","start":814.66,"stop":822.861,"duration":8.2},{"text":"That it would result in the intimidation of a judiciary which would certainly interfere with the functioning of our republican form of government and our system of
