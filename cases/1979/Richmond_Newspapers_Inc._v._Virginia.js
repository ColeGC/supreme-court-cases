suggestion, as I gather it, by the Attorney General is, it would have been nice if the Supreme Court of Virginia had been given an opportunity to narrow the statute down somehow, and that it would have been given a better opportunity to do that, had we brought it into question instead of them.","start":637.008,"stop":651.746,"duration":14.74},{"text":"But it's I think inconceivable that it would have made any difference.","start":651.746,"stop":656.997,"duration":5.25},{"text":"No particular narrow reading was suggested by the Attorney General.","start":656.997,"stop":660.463,"duration":3.47},{"text":"The Attorney General's position is this statute authorized this closure.","start":660.463,"stop":664.684,"duration":4.22},{"text":"And it would have been a rather pointless act for the Supreme Court of Virginia to say this closure was okay, but the statute is not broad enough to sustain it.","start":664.684,"stop":674.699,"duration":10.01},{"text":"We sustain it under some other kind of common law authority.","start":674.699,"stop":677.135,"duration":2.44},{"text":"That would have made enactment of the statute a pointless legislative exercise on the part of the Virginia legislature.","start":677.135,"stop":684.702,"duration":7.57},{"text":"So nothing really could have turned in this case on the form in which the validity of the statute was read.","start":684.702,"stop":691.552,"duration":6.85},{"text":"It was necessarily, therefore, upheld by the Supreme Court of Virginia, when the Court denied appeal, mandamus and prohibition.","start":691.552,"stop":698.862,"duration":7.31},{"text":"And even with that not true, the case would clearly be here on certiorari.","start":698.862,"stop":703.889,"duration":5.03},{"text":"So let me then turn to the merits.","start":703.889,"stop":706.954,"duration":3.06},{"text":"The Virginia Supreme Court upheld this trial closure and denied relief against recurring trial closures, citing only this Court's decision in Gannett.","start":706.954,"stop":717.795,"duration":10.84},{"text":"I must say, that seems a baffling conclusion.","start":717.795,"stop":722.384,"duration":4.59},{"text":"Because of course Gannett involved a pretrial suppression hearing.","start":722.384,"stop":727.459,"duration":5.07},{"text":"No amount of dictum about trials would have permitted the decision in Gannett to resolve an issue that was not before this Court.","start":727.459,"stop":735.664,"duration":8.21},{"text":"The majority opinion twice described the question presented as one about pretrial suppression proceedings only.","start":735.664,"stop":744.283,"duration":8.62},{"text":"And the concluding statement of the holding was equally narrow.","start":744.283,"stop":747.723,"duration":3.44},{"text":"As the Chief Justice obeyed in his concurring opinion, that made all the difference.","start":747.723,"stop":752.256,"duration":4.53},{"text":"And the reason that I would submit it must make a very great deal of difference is, implicit in the purposes and the character and the available alternatives in the two different settings.","start":752.256,"stop":765.937,"duration":13.68},{"text":"Ultimately, the purposes of a pretrial suppression hearing are to keep inadmissible information from the jury, as a cross-section of the public.","start":765.937,"stop":774.762,"duration":8.82},{"text":"In contrast, the purpose of the trial itself is to expose admissible information to the jury as a cross-section of the public.","start":774.762,"stop":784.241,"duration":9.48},{"text":"As a result, the character of the pre-trial proceeding is almost that of an internal governmental mechanism, whereas the character of the trial in chief is the very opposite.","start":784.241,"stop":798.406,"duration":14.16},{"text":"Finally, there are difficulties, inescapably, about, minimizing prejudice arising out of the airing of potentially inadmissible information at a pretrial hearing.","start":798.406,"stop":810.369,"duration":11.96},{"text":"There are devices available and this Court has spoken of them in many cases.","start":810.369,"stop":813.349,"duration":2.98},{"text":"Sequestration is not available because the jury isn't chosen yet.","start":813.349,"stop":817.194,"duration":3.84},{"text":"But there are devices available Changing venue; screening jurors through questioning.","start":817.194,"stop":822.967,"duration":5.77},{"text":"But the difficulty is that they are of uncertain efficacy, and if one must err on the side of fair trial, it seems to follow for some that the public may be excluded as a mechanism.","start":822.967,"stop":837.491,"duration":14.52},{"text":"But the tension between publicity and fairness ceases when the trial begins.","start":837.491,"stop":842.887,"duration":5.4},{"text":"As this Court pointed out in the Gannett opinion, a panoply of devices is then available, including sequestering the jury, in order to avoid any form of prejudicial information from reaching the jury.","start":842.887,"stop":859.113,"duration":16.23},{"text":"So that all of the general references to the central role of fairness in our system in the Attorney General's brief, I submit, are beside the point.","start":859.113,"stop":870.726,"duration":11.61},{"text":"We're devoted to fair trial.","start":870.726,"stop":872.883,"duration":2.16},{"text":"But fair trial does not require closed trial, given the devices that are available.","start":872.883,"stop":879.763,"duration":6.88},{"text":"Now, even if there were no sharp dichotomies, no basic distinction between pretrial suppression hearings on the one hand and the trial on the other even if one viewed them all as part of the same proceeding, I think it's also striking that a majority of the members of this Court in Gannett agreed, though on differing theories, agreed at least that there must be a substantial showing of need before either a trial or a pretrial proceeding can be closed.","start":879.763,"stop":909.99,"duration":30.23},{"text":"And on this record there was no substantial showing of need.","start":909.99,"stop":912.872,"duration":2.88},{"text":"So without even drawing a distinction between pretrial suppression hearings and trials in
