Frey","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.","start":110.525,"stop":114.963,"duration":4.44},{"text":"This case began on January 3, 1974 when Carol Owens, a student visiting Washington, DC for a brief course of study was robbed at gunpoint and sexually molested by the respondent in a stall at the women’s restroom near the Washington Monument.","start":114.963,"stop":134.208,"duration":19.25},{"text":"During the course of what must have been a most harrowing experience, Owens had an extended opportunity to observe her assailant at close range.","start":134.208,"stop":144.027,"duration":9.82},{"text":"She promptly reported the crime to the police and provided them with the description of the robber.","start":144.027,"stop":150.5,"duration":6.47},{"text":"Three days later, two other women were robbed under somewhat similar circumstances in the same rest room and they too gave the police a description of their assailant, which generally correspondent with the description given by Owens.","start":150.5,"stop":167.146,"duration":16.65},{"text":"Subsequently on January 9th, two Park policemen on duty at the monument grounds spotted respondent who appeared to them to fit the description given by the robbery victims.","start":167.146,"stop":179.945,"duration":12.8},{"text":"They approached him and during a brief conversation were told that his name was Keith Crews that he had walked away from school, but he was 16 years old.","start":179.945,"stop":191.026,"duration":11.08},{"text":"After respondent went into the men’s room, the officers conversed with the tour guide who told him that he believe respondent had been at the Monument grounds on the day of the Owens robbery.","start":191.026,"stop":202.018,"duration":10.99},{"text":"On the basis of this additional information, the officers detained respondent and called for the assistance of the detective who was investigating the robberies.","start":202.018,"stop":211.606,"duration":9.59},{"text":"He arrived shortly and attempted to take a photograph of respondent, but was unsuccessful.","start":211.606,"stop":219.358,"duration":7.75},{"text":"He thereupon ordered that the respondent be taken to the nearby Park Police station, which was done.","start":219.358,"stop":225.801,"duration":6.44},{"text":"Respondent was detained at the station for perhaps as long as an hour during which time his photograph was taken and the school was called, he was then released.","start":225.801,"stop":235.628,"duration":9.83},{"text":"Several days later, the photograph taken during the detention was shown to Owens, the robbery victim in a photo array and she identified the respondent as her assailant.","start":235.628,"stop":246.933,"duration":11.31},{"text":"On the basis of this identification he was arrested, again identified in the lineup and ultimately brought to trial.","start":246.933,"stop":255.836,"duration":8.9},{"text":"Upon respondent’s motion to suppress all identifications of him, the trial court determined that the act of taking respondent to the police station was an illegal arrest.","start":255.836,"stop":266.869,"duration":11.03},{"text":"The pretrial identifications were fruit of that arrest and must be suppressed, but that the in-court identification of respondent by his alleged victims had an independent basis derived from their substantial opportunity to observe him during the course of the crime and would not be suppressed.","start":266.869,"stop":284.346,"duration":17.48},{"text":"The trial was then held.","start":284.346,"stop":286.285,"duration":1.94},{"text":"Owens positively identified respondent as her assailant, and he was convicted by the jury of armed robbery.","start":286.285,"stop":294.583,"duration":8.3},{"text":"On appeal, the en banc District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed.","start":294.583,"stop":303.276,"duration":8.69},{"text":"It concluded that Owens’ in-court testimony identifying respondent as the robber should have been suppressed as a fruit of the initial illegal detention of Owens.","start":303.276,"stop":316.37,"duration":13.09},{"text":"Now, we argue in this case for reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals on three separate grounds, any one of which would be sufficient to justify reversal.","start":316.37,"stop":329.224,"duration":12.85},{"text":"The first ground is our contention that the in-court identification testimony was not a fruit of the illegal police conduct.","start":329.224,"stop":337.476,"duration":8.25},{"text":"The second ground is that under attenuation analysis, any taint, if it was a fruit should be held attenuated.","start":337.476,"stop":347.579,"duration":10.1},{"text":"And the third ground is that in any event under the circumstances of this case at least, if not generally, that the testimony of the victim of the crime, particularly a crime of violence ought not to be excluded as a matter of exclusionary rule policy.","start":347.579,"stop":364.566,"duration":16.99},{"text":"Now, I’d like to consider first the question which I think is a perplexing one of whether Owens’ in-court identification testimony was a fruit of the illegal detention of Respondent Crews, a subject on which both sides have spilled a great deal of ink.","start":364.566,"stop":385.618,"duration":21.05},{"text":"It is a given in this case that from the time of the robbery to the time of trial, Owens possessed on the basis of her observations during the robbery, the ability to identify her assailant.","start":385.618,"stop":397.027,"duration":11.41},{"text":"Nothing that happened during the course of the investigation of this case altered or enhanced that ability except in one respect, the respondent was in court to be identified because of a chain of events proceeding from the unlawful taking of his photograph and of course, if he were not present in court, Owens could not have identified him as her assailant.","start":397.027,"stop":422.48,"duration":25.45},{"text":"We stress the untainted nature of Owens inherent ability to identify respondent, while he stresses the uselessness of that ability without his presence to be identified.","start":422.48,"stop":436.692,"duration":14.21},{"text":"What is really going on here?","start":436.692,"stop":439.093,"duration":2.4},{"text":"Is it, as the Court of Appeals and respondent insist simply a wholly conventional application of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine?","start":439.093,"stop":447.603,"duration":8.51},{"text":"Is the victim’s identification of her attacker really no different from drugs seized from a house during an illegal warrantless search or a firearm seized from a person of an illegally-arrested suspect?","start":447.603,"stop":460.113,"duration":12.51},{"text":"It doesn’t seem to be the same on the surface at least to us, but let’s look more deeply and see whether the superficial appearances are deceiving.","start":460.113,"stop":470.977,"duration":10.86},{"text":"Now, we submit that a close look at this case reveals what is actually happening here and that is, that the court is suppressing the defendant’s presence at trial on the ground that the probable cause underlying his arrest and indictment is the product of the illegal detention.","start":470.977,"stop":489.827,"duration":18.85},{"text":"Respondent would agree, I think, that the court was not suppressing and could not properly have suppressed Owens’ testimony describing the circumstances of the crime or generally describing her recollection of the assailant.","start":489.827,"stop":505.123,"duration":15.3},{"text":"It is just unconceivable that those things could be fruits.","start":505.123,"stop":508.673,"duration":3.55},{"text":"The only arguable suppressible ingredient of her testimony concerns her ability to point to the respondent in the courtroom and say, “That’s the man.”","start":508.673,"stop":518.592,"duration":9.92},{"text":"Now the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in this regard is perhaps most clearly laid out in a portion of the opinion where they are actually discussing the temporal proximity factor and this is a page 38 (a) to 39 (a) of the appendix to the petition.","start":518.592,"stop":535.818,"duration":17.23},{"text":"The court says, “While the initial arrest and the taking of the photograph did occur on January 9, 1974, the illegality in this case did not end on that date.","start":535.818,"stop":545.914,"duration":10.1},{"text":"He eventual rearrest” --","start":545.914,"stop":547.156,"duration":1.24}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.

just bear with me very briefly, I’ll be right there.","start":629.923,"stop":646.33,"duration":16.41},{"text":"What the Court of Appeals said was the entire course of events was accomplished in violation of the Fourth Amendment.","start":646.33,"stop":652.198,"duration":5.87},{"text":"Since apparently there was no independent probable cause for official detention the wrong thus continued.","start":652.198,"stop":659.201,"duration":7},{"text":"And respondent in his brief also suggests that the, I think it’s page 46, Note 37 that the identification testimony by Owens would not be suppressible if the Government had untainted, independent probable cause to try the respondent.","start":659.201,"stop":677.106,"duration":17.9},{"text":"Even, and I think, although you have to ask him, that he would accept that view even if the proceedings in some way originated with an illegal arrest of the respondent.","start":677.106,"stop":691.951,"duration":14.85},{"text":"Now, we are prepared to accept the notion that the respondent’s presence in court in this case was logically a fruit of his illegal detention.","start":691.951,"stop":702.851,"duration":10.9},{"text":"What we do not accept because it is contrary to settle law, is that his presence in court is subject to suppression.","start":702.851,"stop":713.616,"duration":10.76},{"text":"That a defendant may not object to being tried on the ground that his presence in court is the product of an illegal seizure of his person is settled by the Ker-Frisbie line of cases.","start":713.616,"stop":724.2,"duration":10.58},{"text":"And this Court said in Gerstein against Pugh the following on this point.","start":724.2,"stop":729.868,"duration":5.67},{"text":"“In holding of the prosecutor’s assessment of probable cause is not sufficient alone to justify restraint of liberty pending trial, we do not imply that the accused is entitled to judicial oversight or review of the decision to prosecute.","start":729.868,"stop":745.066,"duration":15.2},{"text":"Instead, we adhere to the Court’s prior holdings that a judicial hearing is not prerequisite to prosecution by information, nor do we retreat from the established rule that illegal arrests or detention does not void a subsequent conviction.”","start":745.066,"stop":761.256,"duration":16.19},{"text":"Now in my view, there is only one arguably material distinction between the Ker-Frisbie line of cases and the present case, and I think that the Court of Appeals relied on it, and I should address it.","start":761.256,"stop":775.627,"duration":14.37},{"text":"The distinction is that in the Ker-Frisbie line of cases, the probable cause to try the defendant was possessed by the police prior to the time that the defendant was kidnapped in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and brought to court for trial.","start":775.627,"stop":794.431,"duration":18.8},{"text":"And I think respondent would say that is critical difference.","start":794.431,"stop":799.886,"duration":5.45},{"text":"We say that distinction does not help the respondent and we rely for that on the Costello, Blue, Collander line of cases and we have not discussed that in the brief, so I do want to stress it here.","start":799.886,"stop":812.177,"duration":12.29},{"text":"It’s the fruit of some further thought in the course of preparing the argument.","start":812.177,"stop":817.191,"duration":5.01},{"text":"He is saying, “You can’t bring me to trial because the, in effect, the Grand Jury proceeding that found probable cause to try me was tainted.","start":817.191,"stop":826.428,"duration":9.24},{"text":"It was based on illegally-seized evidence, this photograph and the out-of-court identification.","start":826.428,"stop":832.297,"duration":5.87},{"text":"You have no business having me in this courtroom and therefore the inchoate ability that the police already possessed to have Owens identify me should not be usable by the prosecution because it can’t properly be put together with her pointing finger at me.”","start":832.297,"stop":850.806,"duration":18.51},{"text":"Now, however, Collander establishes, Costello establishes, Blue establishes that you cannot attack the indictment or your presence in court on the basis that it is predicated on illegally-seized evidence or, indeed, on the general lack of probable cause to support the indictment.","start":850.806,"stop":871.984,"duration":21.18},{"text":"So if we are right that the respondent cannot suppress the fact that his presence in court then the only logical basis for his claim is that Owens’ in-court identification was a fruit of his illegal detention disappears.","start":871.984,"stop":886.161,"duration":14.18},{"text":"Now, I would like to present a hypothetical at this point which I think is quite illuminating.","start":886.161,"stop":893.21,"duration":7.05},{"text":"Let us suppose that during the course of the robbery, Owens had a camera and she took a picture of her assailant and when she went to the police she gave the police the undeveloped roll of film and she said, “I think I have a picture of him on this roll of film.”","start":893.21,"stop":910.07,"duration":16.86},{"text":"She also gave the general description, as she did in this case.","start":910.07,"stop":914.622,"duration":4.55},{"text":"While the film is being developed, the police officers see respondent, exactly the same procedure as here goes on they say to themselves, “We’d better get his picture so that we can compare it with what may come out on the film.”","start":914.622,"stop":927.358,"duration":12.74},{"text":"They get his picture, they compare it with what came out on the film they say it’s a perfect match.","start":927.358,"stop":933.149,"duration":5.79},{"text":"He’s indicted, he’s brought into court, we introduced the picture and we say to the jury, “Look at this

man.”","start":941.19,"stop":943.613,"duration":2.42},{"text":"Now, in our view, this undeveloped photograph is the same thing as the mental image that Owens had of the crime and of her assailant, and
