is far smaller than the state's tax.","start":72.618,"stop":76.783,"duration":4.17},{"text":"Their claim in this litigation is that their entry into the cigarette business together with their tax or

consequences.","start":115.896,"stop":119.909,"duration":4.01},{"text":"Because their taxes or fees are 13 to 16 cents per pack lower than the state taxes, the tribes sell large quantities of

Gay, you found no treaty or statutory bar to a local tax on non-Indian cattle grazing on reservation land leased from the tribes with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, even though the tribal leases were granted under express statutory authority from Congress.","start":406.748,"stop":429.526,"duration":22.78},{"text":"And finally, three years ago, in Moe, you upheld a state cigarette tax on non-Indian purchasers from an Indian smoke shop.","start":429.526,"stop":438.929,"duration":9.4},{"text":"That smoke shop was located on land leased from the tribe, a tribe also controlled the shop's purchases of cigarettes and charged the operator an administrative fee.","start":438.929,"stop":450.592,"duration":11.66},{"text":"Nevertheless, you found no treaty or statutory provision to preempt the state tax.","start":450.592,"stop":457.76,"duration":7.17},{"text":"To return for a third time to the decision in Thomas v.
