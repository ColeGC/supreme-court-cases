Fishgold.","start":500.015,"stop":506.948,"duration":6.93},{"text":"First, the escalator principle was established, that is that a veteran who returns to his employment is to be reinstated at the same

examined.","start":547.797,"stop":551.018,"duration":3.22},{"text":"And it is to be determined whether other one hand the benefit is primarily in the nature of a reward for length of service in which

performed.","start":551.018,"stop":568.391,"duration":17.37},{"text":"Applying this test, severance pay and pension benefits have been held by this Court to be perquisites of

would like briefly to discuss the notion of a work requirement upon which the District Court and respondent have focused some of their attention.","start":582.492,"stop":599.887,"duration":17.39},{"text":"There is no dispute here that SUB credits are primarily earn by employees who are workers.","start":599.887,"stop":607.63,"duration":7.74},{"text":"This is naturally true of most benefits that this Court has dealt with whether they are determined by language in the collective-bargaining agreement that refers to work or whether that it is determined by language that refers use of service.","start":607.63,"stop":622.788,"duration":15.16},{"text":"Now, in Alabama Power, a contention was made to this Court that any benefit that is determined by work requirement, that is where the collective-bargaining agreement specifies that most of the employees who earn the benefit will be working, should automatically dispose of any contention that the benefit maybe treated as a perquisite of seniority.","start":622.788,"stop":645.268,"duration":22.48},{"text":"The Court expressly rejected that contention in Alabama Power and it noted that almost any benefit could be tied to a work requirement such as existed in that case.","start":645.268,"stop":655.676,"duration":10.41},{"text":"That would permit the employer himself to decide whether a benefit was a perquisite of seniority and the employer himself to decide whether the veteran was entitled to have his service time credited.","start":655.676,"stop":667.774,"duration":12.1},{"text":"However, Congress has not left that decision up to the employer.","start":667.774,"stop":672.428,"duration":4.65},{"text":"This is a decision that Congress has made.","start":672.428,"stop":679.872,"duration":7.44},{"text":"Now, as far as the work requirement in this case, it is significantly less in the work requirement that this Court rejected in Alabama Power.","start":679.872,"stop":689.805,"duration":9.93},{"text":"There, the question was whether the employee was entitled to accredited service time for the time that he spent in the military.","start":689.805,"stop":697.076,"duration":7.27},{"text":"Accredited service was defined in terms of full time service at 40 hours per week.","start":697.076,"stop":703.801,"duration":6.73},{"text":"Moreover, the limited exceptions in Alabama Power, applied only to employees who are on paid leave not employees who are in certain categories of unpaid leave as in this case.","start":703.801,"stop":717.161,"duration":13.36},{"text":"We believe that SUB benefits should be treated as a perquisite of seniority.","start":717.161,"stop":723.148,"duration":5.99},{"text":"They serve a purpose that is akin to the most traditional seniority benefit.","start":723.148,"stop":728.665,"duration":5.52},{"text":"And this analysis incidentally was made by the Third Circuit in the Foster decision which was later affirmed by this Court.","start":728.665,"stop":736.55,"duration":7.88},{"text":"The -- the primary purpose of SUB benefits is to protect employees against economic loss during periods of the diminished employment.","start":736.55,"stop":746.155,"duration":9.61},{"text":"It acts as an adjunct to the normal layoff protection that employees get when they accrue seniority benefits.","start":746.155,"stop":753.476,"duration":7.32},{"text":"Thus when, there's an economic downturn and the employer is forced to layoff a number of employees, what happens, is those employees that have accrued the most amount of seniority are protected from layoff because of the seniority that they have accrued.","start":753.476,"stop":769.209,"duration":15.73},{"text":"Employees who have not accrued enough seniority to be protected from layoff get this more limited protection of the SUB benefits.","start":769.209,"stop":778.54,"duration":9.33},{"text":"That is they receive some money to tie them over the period for which they are unemployed and employees who have the least seniority at all will either not be eligible at all for SUB payments or they will receive less because they
