Justice, and may it please the Court.","start":16.379,"stop":20.004,"duration":3.63},{"text":"The concessions that petitioner makes in his brief and those my brother Mr. Bruno made in his argument yesterday affirm the accuracy of the government's statement of the question in its brief.","start":20.004,"stop":35.516,"duration":15.51},{"text":"We stated the question to be whether the Emergency School Aid Act authorizes the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to withhold the special funds provided under that statutory program from a school district whose faculty assignment policies have a disparate racial impact most justified by educational needs, without a showing that they violate the equal protection clause.","start":35.516,"stop":63.761,"duration":28.25},{"text":"We argued yesterday that section 1605(d)(1)(B) which is the statutory provision providing for disqualification of certain school districts, establishes a result test for the disproportionate demotion or dismissal of faculty or other personnel, and this of course requires us to focus on the second clause which provides \"or otherwise engaged in discrimination based upon race, color or national origin in the hiring, promotion or assignment of employees.\"","start":63.761,"stop":105.626,"duration":41.87},{"text":"And of course, the construction that the Court accords to this clause will determine the validity of the regulation which petitioner admits has not been adhered to by its school board.","start":105.626,"stop":126.071,"duration":20.44},{"text":"We suggest that there is no reason why racially disparate hiring, promotion or assignment should produce a result different from disproportionate demotion or dismissal to justify the requirement of a motive for one and not for the other.","start":126.071,"stop":148.477,"duration":22.41},{"text":"And we have endeavored to --","start":148.477,"stop":150.311,"duration":1.83}]},{"speakerName":"Potter

different language in these two instances.","start":156.899,"stop":171.204,"duration":14.31},{"text":"And I think the best argument that occurs to me at this time is as follows.","start":171.204,"stop":177.611,"duration":6.41},{"text":"The attention of the Congress was focused upon what had been de jure separate school systems in the South which, of course, were dual school systems and were duplicative in so many respects.","start":177.611,"stop":194.246,"duration":16.64},{"text":"There was the white school and there were, as were known in those days, the \"colored schools,\" and there were principles for each, administrative personnel for each, as well as instructional personnel or faculty, and the Congress was concerned that in the dismantlement of dual systems that black employees or minority employees would be disproportionately fired.","start":194.246,"stop":226.501,"duration":32.25},{"text":"For example, if the system had 40 white principals and 10 black principals for a total of 50, and it ended up that it just needed 40 once the separate system was to be dismantled, the Congress focused its attention to the situation which might result in the firing of all 10 black principals, and therefore the language \"disproportionate dismissal.\"","start":226.501,"stop":253.612,"duration":27.11}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Or demotion.","start":253.612,"stop":254.776,"duration":1.16}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Seems appropriate.","start":254.776,"stop":256.324,"duration":1.55},{"text":"However, one has difficulty with a concept such as disproportionate hiring.","start":256.324,"stop":262.764,"duration":6.44},{"text":"What does disproportionate hiring mean?","start":262.764,"stop":264.489,"duration":1.72},{"text":"I have difficulty with that.","start":264.489,"stop":266.034,"duration":1.55},{"text":"Does this mean that if 5 candidates present themselves, 4 of one race and 1 of another, that to hire any other than a 4-to-1 ratio would be disproportionate?","start":266.034,"stop":282.267,"duration":16.23},{"text":"This does not make sense to me in terms of whether the candidates had the skills that were needed at the time -- one might be a Latin teacher, an English teacher, a French teacher, and so on.","start":282.267,"stop":296.561,"duration":14.29},{"text":"I have even more trouble with the notion of disproportionate assignment if it means in proportion to what?","start":296.561,"stop":304.849,"duration":8.29},{"text":"In proportion to the number of people in the school system?","start":304.849,"stop":308.155,"duration":3.31},{"text":"And I don't think the Congress wanted to establish a quota in the establishment of schools and the hiring and promotion and assignment of course looks towards establishment and not disestablishment.","start":308.155,"stop":323.614,"duration":15.46},{"text":"And for that reason it would seem to used the phrase \"otherwise discriminate\" allows more latitude in the establishment and ongoing conduct of a school district.","start":323.614,"stop":336.49,"duration":12.88},{"text":"And that satisfies me as a sufficient reason for using different language, but still having a results test, and as the regulation provides, the results test is met if the discrimination in hiring or assignment results in the school being identified as a school for children or for students of a particular race, color, or national origin.","start":336.49,"stop":371.488,"duration":35}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"General McCree, would you say that the word \"discriminate\" means treat

means.","start":376.867,"stop":381.971,"duration":5.1},{"text":"But that doesn't mean discriminate in the sense of a constitutionally impermissible discernment of who the persons were, because obviously they have to discern who they are to avoid the disproportionate dismissal or demotion.","start":381.971,"stop":403.985,"duration":22.01},{"text":"So discrimination occurs in that process, too.","start":403.985,"stop":408.919,"duration":4.93},{"text":"And yet it is conceded that that is a results test.","start":408.919,"stop":412.697,"duration":3.78}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Wouldn't you say, Mr. Solicitor General, that the word \"discriminate\" or \"engage in discrimination,\" to use the statutory language, standing alone implies some kind of an intention?","start":412.697,"stop":426.889,"duration":14.19},{"text":"I mean, if you had discriminatory effect, then that would have its own meaning, but \"engage in discrimination,\" doesn't that imply intent?","start":426.889,"stop":436.882,"duration":9.99}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think it certainly implies awareness or discernment.","start":436.882,"stop":442.615,"duration":5.73},{"text":"Discrimination means to be aware of a difference, and it doesn't necessarily mean to implement.","start":442.615,"stop":450.133,"duration":7.52},{"text":"I can discriminate between colors or among colors.","start":450.133,"stop":455.775,"duration":5.64},{"text":"That doesn't mean I am going to do anything about it.","start":455.775,"stop":457.582,"duration":1.81}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"But that is a consciousness and

awareness.","start":458.636,"stop":461.755,"duration":3.12},{"text":"And again we're talking about a results test and it would just appear that the Congress used that phrase, \"otherwise discriminate,\" to mean otherwise produce a result that would show that the statutory purpose which of course was to eliminate the distinction between de jure and de facto and to protect the children
