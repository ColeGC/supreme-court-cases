United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.","start":73.045,"stop":79.537,"duration":6.49},{"text":"The cases arise under the Federal statute 18 United States Code Section 751 that prohibits a person from escaping from the custody of the Attorney General or from any custody in which he was placed under Federal law pursuant to court order.","start":79.537,"stop":95.582,"duration":16.04},{"text":"There are two issues presented.","start":95.582,"stop":97.837,"duration":2.26},{"text":"First is whether in establishing the intent element of the crime of escape, the Government is required to prove merely that the defendant left the prison consciously, not inadvertently.","start":97.837,"stop":111.364,"duration":13.53},{"text":"In addition, the Government prove that the defendant intended to avoid only those aspects of confinement in the prison that may be regarded as normal.","start":111.364,"stop":122.072,"duration":10.71},{"text":"Under the latter formulation which was adopted by the Court of Appeals in this case, a prisoner who deliberately left a prison but did so for the purpose of avoiding certain harsh conditions there would not commit the crime of the State.","start":122.072,"stop":139.599,"duration":17.53},{"text":"The second issue concerns the nature of the showing a defendant in an escape case must make under Section 751 in order to raise the defense duress.","start":139.599,"stop":150.42,"duration":10.82},{"text":"This defense has long been recognized that the common law and generally in Federally criminal prosecutions.","start":150.42,"stop":158.006,"duration":7.59},{"text":"The Court must decide here whether a

imposed.","start":190.628,"stop":199.035,"duration":8.41},{"text":"Respondent Cooley was convicted in a later jury trial of escaping from the District of Columbia jail as well and he too was sentenced to imprisonment for five years.","start":199.035,"stop":209.297,"duration":10.26},{"text":"Prior to the escape Respondent Bailey had been serving a sentence in the Leavenworth penitentiary on conviction of bank robbery and attempted escape but he was brought to the District of Columbia to testify in a pending criminal case.","start":209.297,"stop":223.037,"duration":13.74},{"text":"Respondent Walker was also serving a sentence in the Leavenworth penitentiary on conviction of bank robbery and he too was brought to

unlawful possession of firearms.","start":232.927,"stop":240.866,"duration":7.94},{"text":"The evidence at the trial of these three Respondents showed that they left the jail in the early morning hours of August 26, 1976 by crawling through a window in the Northeast 1 Unit of the District of Columbia jail, which was the maximum security facility at the jail.","start":240.866,"stop":258.748,"duration":17.88},{"text":"They were apprehended by FBI agents in the District of Columbia on November 19, December 13 and September 27, respectively, which was

and that they had remained in hiding until they were apprehended.","start":275.305,"stop":283.504,"duration":8.2},{"text":"But they sought to justify their escape by introducing evidence of what they contended were intolerable conditions in the jail.","start":283.504,"stop":291.574,"duration":8.07},{"text":"Early in the trial and on several occasions thereafter the Government argued that they were not entitled to raise the defense of duress because they had not surrendered to custody promptly after their departure.","start":291.574,"stop":303.258,"duration":11.68},{"text":"The Court agreed with the Government on this point and several times informed Respondents to that point.","start":303.258,"stop":308.611,"duration":5.35},{"text":"They chose to allow them to present their evidence of jail conditions and to wait until the end of the trial to determine whether evidence was in the record to support a finding that they had satisfied the return requirement.","start":308.611,"stop":321.432,"duration":12.82},{"text":"The three Respondents and several other inmates and several jail officials then testified about certain conditions in the jail.","start":321.432,"stop":329.61,"duration":8.18},{"text":"There was testimony that trash, sheets, mattresses and similar items were burned, some of the testimony suggested frequently, during the

Kneedler","textObjs":[{"text":"That is right, but the -- but after the judge had instructed them at the close of the trial, the judge concluded that there was not evidence in the record from which the jury could find that they had satisfied the return requirement of duress defense they had not surrendered to custody.","start":412.496,"stop":429.022,"duration":16.53},{"text":"And therefore he did not give them duress instruction and directed the jury not to consider the jail conditions.","start":429.022,"stop":435.683,"duration":6.66}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, then how can we be sure just what the jail conditions were, since presumably the jury was entitled to disbelieve the testimony of witnesses heard?","start":435.683,"stop":449.175,"duration":13.49}]},{"speakerName":"Edwin S. Kneedler","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, surely, yes, that is right.","start":449.175,"stop":452.547,"duration":3.37},{"text":"I think on the basis of the record as it comes to the Court that there is not a jury verdict that took into account the jail conditions.","start":452.547,"stop":464.113,"duration":11.57},{"text":"So again, the evidence has to be considered in the manner presented by the Respondents.","start":464.113,"stop":473.162,"duration":9.05},{"text":"In addition to the evidence of the fires, Respondents Cooley and Bailey also presented some testimony that they were beaten by guards during the summer and that they were threatened with similar action.","start":473.162,"stop":485.239,"duration":12.08},{"text":"Respondent Walker did not base his duress on such beating but did allege that he had, and sought to establish that he had received inadequate medical treatment for an alleged epileptic condition.","start":485.239,"stop":500.494,"duration":15.26},{"text":"Finally, Respondent Cooley also at one time testified that he left on the morning of the 26th because he had been threatened by Bailey and Walker, but he later admitted that there was no one outside the cell when he left, that the threats occurred later and he didn't know whether Bailey and Walker had actually left.","start":500.494,"stop":524.311,"duration":23.82},{"text":"The Respondents also sought to testify about certain actions that happened after they escaped.","start":524.311,"stop":529.026,"duration":4.71},{"text":"Respondent Walker testified that he made three telephone calls to the FBI.","start":529.026,"stop":534.597,"duration":5.57},{"text":"The agent with whom he spoke, Walker testified, assured him that he would not be harmed if he surrendered but refused to guarantee that he would not be returned in to the District of Columbia jail if he did surrender.","start":534.597,"stop":547.318,"duration":12.72},{"text":"Respondent Bailey testified that he had someone else call the authorities but he didn't identify who that was and he admitted that he didn't make any telephone calls himself or make any other effort to turn himself in.","start":547.318,"stop":559.569,"duration":12.25},{"text":"Respondent Cooley's testimony on this point is somewhat ambiguous but it can be read to suggest that certain members of his family may have tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with authorities.","start":559.569,"stop":571.087,"duration":11.52},{"text":"And the Government did present witnesses in an effort to rebut this testimony and had the duress defense been presented to the jury, then this Government evidence would have come into play.","start":571.087,"stop":584.91,"duration":13.82},{"text":"As I mentioned, at the close of trial the Court denied Respondents' request for jury instruction.","start":584.91,"stop":590.156,"duration":5.25},{"text":"It also instructed the jury that escape is a general intent crime and in explaining that the Court stated that general intent only requires to do an act consciously or purposely rather than inadvertently.","start":590.156,"stop":605.059,"duration":14.9},{"text":"And by this, I think it is fair to say the Court was referring to the act of leaving the prison.","start":605.059,"stop":610.633,"duration":5.57},{"text":"The evidence at Respondent Cogdell's trial showed that he also left the District of Columbia jail on the 26th and he was apprehended hiding in a closet in a residence in Hyattsville, Maryland about a month later.","start":610.633,"stop":623.882,"duration":13.25},{"text":"Respondent Cogdell also offered that his departure was compelled by prison conditions, but because he too had not surrendered the Court rejected his proffered testimony and the duress defense.","start":623.882,"stop":638.116,"duration":14.23},{"text":"The jury returned a verdict of guilty in both cases.","start":638.116,"stop":641.251,"duration":3.13},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed the convictions and remanded some new trials.","start":641.251,"stop":648.914,"duration":7.66},{"text":"The Court of Appeals found two bases on which the jury could have or should have been able to consider the evidence of the jail conditions prior to the departure.","start":648.914,"stop":658.506,"duration":9.59},{"text":"First, the Court of Appeals thought that this evidence bore on the question of intent.","start":658.506,"stop":664.656,"duration":6.15},{"text":"In the Court of Appeals view, once a defendant in an escape case has introduced evidence of what the Court would term abnormal conditions of confinement, there is at least a question raised as to whether the defendant actually intended to leave confinement as such or whether he was really motivated by a desire to avoid those unpleasant conditions.","start":664.656,"stop":687.077,"duration":22.42},{"text":"Accordingly, the Court held that it made him guilty of escape only if he had the intent to avoid abnormal conditions of confinement.","start":687.077,"stop":697.313,"duration":10.24},{"text":"The Court also concluded that Respondents' evidence of jail conditions was sufficient to raise a jury question under the duress defense, but in doing so the Court stated that the traditional rule of duress defense, that it can be raised only where the defendant acted out of immediate threat of serious harm should be relaxed in the prison escape context because the opportunity for a prisoner to escape may not remain available, while a substantial threat would right that into an immediate one.","start":697.313,"stop":728.771,"duration":31.46},{"text":"Finally, the District Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had erred in imposing a firm return requirement for defendant after he departed from custody.","start":728.771,"stop":737.985,"duration":9.21},{"text":"The Court advocated that the failure of a prisoner to return to custody was essentially a fact for the jury to consider in determining whether his continued absence might be justified by a possible continuation of the conditions that led him to depart.","start":737.985,"stop":756.008,"duration":18.02},{"text":"Government's suggestion for rehearing en banc was denied and the Government then petitioned for certiorari.","start":756.008,"stop":761.945,"duration":5.94},{"text":"The Court of Appeals decision if affirmed by this Court could have serious ramifications for the courts in interpreting the law of escape and as a result could also have serious consequences for the order and security of the District of Columbia jail, the Federal penal system generally and society at large.","start":761.945,"stop":782.098,"duration":20.15},{"text":"Escape carries with it a substantial potential for violence, even where the inmate himself does not intend to resort to violence.","start":782.098,"stop":790.433,"duration":8.34},{"text":"Escapes also disrupt the order of the prison and cause understandable apprehension among the public.","start":790.433,"stop":796.145,"duration":5.71},{"text":"For these reasons and because escape demonstrates contempt for the rule of law, escape has been traditionally treated as a serious crime.","start":796.145,"stop":805.547,"duration":9.4},{"text":"Any effort to justify or excuse an escape must therefore be treated with considerable caution.","start":805.547,"stop":813.095,"duration":7.55},{"text":"The Court of Appeals holding that a prisoner does not commit an offense if he escapes to avoid certain adverse conditions of confinement rather than confinement as such, finds no support in case law, Federal or State.","start":813.095,"stop":827.06,"duration":13.96},{"text":"Moreover, the Court's distinction between what is called normal and non-normal conditions of confinement is not fully articulated in the opinion.","start":827.06,"stop":838.159,"duration":11.1},{"text":"And the basis of that distinction is not wrong.","start":838.159,"stop":840.932,"duration":2.77},{"text":"For example, it isn't clear whether all jail situations that this Court might find to be in violation of the Eighth Amendment would be considered to be non-normal, at least as traditionally determined, and therefore justify a prisoner in escaping.","start":840.932,"stop":857.98,"duration":17.05},{"text":"There is also no expressed requirement as the intent argument is formulated by the Court of Appeals that these adverse conditions present an immediate threat to the safety or health or life of the prisoner.","start":857.98,"stop":873.602,"duration":15.62},{"text":"Therefore, the manner in which the Court of Appeals dealt with the intent element introduces a great deal of uncertainty and vagueness into the crime of escape and causes prisoners, would cause corruptions officials and juries and judges to speculate and guess as to what types of conditions might excuse an escape.","start":873.602,"stop":898.981,"duration":25.38},{"text":"Finally, the Court of Appeals treatment of the intent element has the effect of converting an escape into a self-help remedy by which the prisoner may seek to avoid the conditions of confinement that are unsatisfactory to him rather than resorting to legal remedies.","start":898.981,"stop":914.46,"duration":15.48},{"text":"In this case the Respondents indisputably intended to leave the District of Columbia jail, whatever may have been their motivation in doing so.","start":914.46,"stop":922.491,"duration":8.03},{"text":"And there is no indication that Congress intended the Government should have to prove anything more than that in making out a prima facie case of escape.","start":922.491,"stop":931.272,"duration":8.78},{"text":"The Court of Appeals evident concern about the dilemma of a prisoner who faces truly threatening conditions in a jail is therefore better dealt with not in the intent element which is part of the Government's case in chief, but where it has traditionally been addressed and that is in the affirmative defense of duress.","start":931.272,"stop":949.435,"duration":18.16},{"text":"That defense has over the years embodied the societal and legal judgment there are occasions when it is inappropriate to punish a person because his conduct was compelled by external forces.","start":949.435,"stop":964.082,"duration":14.65},{"text":"The duress defense has long recognized that at least in some circumstances a person cannot fairly be blamed for his conduct in those situations.","start":964.082,"stop":972.761,"duration":8.68},{"text":"The conduct of one who acts under compulsion is still criminal because all of the elements of the crime are present, including the intent to act.","start":972.761,"stop":982.28,"duration":9.52},{"text":"But even though criminal, the conduct is excused for reasons of social policy.","start":982.28,"stop":989.133,"duration":6.85},{"text":"It is apparent however that the defense of duress carries with it the seeds of potential disorder because it allows a judge and jury to excuse conduct in a particular case that the representatives of the people have chosen to make criminal and because it may also create an incentive for a defendant to claim falsely that he acted under coercion when it will be quite difficult for the prosecution to disprove those suggestions of coercion.","start":989.133,"stop":1022.425,"duration":33.29},{"text":"As a result, the duress defense has historically been hedged with restrictions which stick to limit its applications to situations in which the individual had no reasonable choice but to commit the offense.","start":1022.425,"stop":1035.662,"duration":13.24},{"text":"Thus the defendant is excused only if he acted under a threat of what he reasonably believed to be serious personal injury or death.","start":1035.662,"stop":1046.06,"duration":10.4},{"text":"And that is aggravated circumstances in order society requires an individual would stand a threat rather than break the law.","start":1046.06,"stop":1054.368,"duration":8.31},{"text":"Further, the threatened harm must be unavoidable because if there are other legal recourses available there is no reason to permit the individual to resort to illegal methods.","start":1054.368,"stop":1064.244,"duration":9.88},{"text":"And finally, in order to be excused the criminal conduct may not be of any greater magnitude or duration than is reasonably necessary to avoid the threatened harm.","start":1064.244,"stop":1076.111,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Duress has always been theoretically available as a defense in a prison escape case.","start":1076.111,"stop":1082.332,"duration":6.22},{"text":"But, the courts have been understandably reluctant to excuse a prisoner when he claims that his departure was compelled by circumstances of confinement, because after all confinement itself is objectionable to many people.","start":1082.332,"stop":1097.663,"duration":15.33},{"text":"Accordingly, most courts that have considered the issue have required the defendant to satisfy certain prerequisites to raising a duress defense.","start":1097.663,"stop":1107.032,"duration":9.37},{"text":"These are not novel, however they are merely adaptations of the general rules that I have just articulated for the duress defense generally.","start":1107.032,"stop":1114.729,"duration":7.7},{"text":"Again, the prisoner must fear an imminent threat.","start":1114.729,"stop":1120.43,"duration":5.7},{"text":"Second, there must be no lawful means available to the prisoner to avoid it, such a resort to prison grievance prison system, prison officials or the courts.","start":1120.43,"stop":1129.223,"duration":8.79},{"text":"And finally, the courts have insisted that the prisoner return to custody promptly or report to authorities in meaningful fashion after the departure in order to take advantage of the defense.","start":1129.223,"stop":1141.356,"duration":12.13}]},{"speakerName":"Potter
