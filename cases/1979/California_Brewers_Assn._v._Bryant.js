seniority.","start":158.136,"stop":167.247,"duration":9.11},{"text":"He acquires seniority on two different bases.","start":167.247,"stop":170.465,"duration":3.22},{"text":"He acquires seniority on

employee.","start":199.831,"stop":205.763,"duration":5.93},{"text":"Now, when he's a new employee as he's working along this way, he is building up plant seniority as a new employee.","start":205.763,"stop":212.072,"duration":6.31},{"text":"He's also building up industry seniority as a new employee.","start":212.072,"stop":216.986,"duration":4.91},{"text":"Among other new employees, he has seniority rights within the plant.","start":216.986,"stop":221.467,"duration":4.48},{"text":"He would be laid off after other -- after other new employees were laid off who were

last.","start":300.498,"stop":314.831,"duration":14.33},{"text":"This is the way it works on a plant by plant basis.","start":314.831,"stop":318.785,"duration":3.95},{"text":"In addition to this, our industry applications of the seniority principle -- for example, the temporary employee and I might pause here for a second to point out that the term “temporary employee” maybe a misnomer.","start":318.785,"stop":331.137,"duration":12.35},{"text":"It's a term that is used in the contract.","start":331.137,"stop":333.483,"duration":2.35},{"text":"These are not temporary employees in the sense that they're casual employees, these and temporary employees maybe employees who have worked for a period of years within the industry and have acquired important and significant rights.","start":333.483,"stop":346.162,"duration":12.68},{"text":"The temporary employee on the basis of this industry service, he may work for one company, for two companies, for three companies, will acquire rights and will work -- work towards acquiring the 45 weeks of work within the calendar year which will enable him to become a permanent employee.This is an application of industry seniority.","start":346.162,"stop":367.146,"duration":20.98},{"text":"Also, there's another application of industry seniority as far as temporary employees are concerned.If a temporary employee is out of work, he's been laid off by his own employer and all the temporary employees with plant seniority at another plant have been recalled and they still need for additional temporary employees of that plant, the plant employee or the temporary employee with the greatest industry seniority will be the first person recalled to that plant.","start":367.146,"stop":394.229,"duration":27.08},{"text":"So this is another application of the seniority principle working within the system.","start":394.229,"stop":401.941,"duration":7.71},{"text":"And the employees also are acquiring in other rights in addition to the competitive rights of seniority which I mentioned.","start":401.941,"stop":407.631,"duration":5.69},{"text":"They're also acquiring benefit rights.","start":407.631,"stop":410.41,"duration":2.78},{"text":"They're acquiring rights as far as health and wealth are concerned.","start":410.41,"stop":413.637,"duration":3.23},{"text":"They're acquiring rights as far as pensions are

building up within this multitiered system as the employees progress through the system.","start":419.095,"stop":426.397,"duration":7.3},{"text":"Now, when the system comes to the point where the employee is working, say less than 45 weeks, the temporary employee is working less than 45 weeks within the calendar year, and so therefore, he does not become a permanent employee.","start":426.397,"stop":443.533,"duration":17.14},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit suggested or claimed that this was an all or nothing proposition, and that he had to start over again on January 1 of the following year and earn the 45 weeks of work within that year.","start":443.533,"stop":456.597,"duration":13.06},{"text":"In our opinion, this was a failure on the part of the Ninth Circuit to examine the system as a whole as this Court has said on numerous occasions, seniority systems are quite varied in their application in the varieties that they have and that there's no one system is
