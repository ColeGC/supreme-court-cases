put in the petition for certiorari it appeared that there were 14,000 oil spills that the Government was aware of under this Act and something like 8,000 of those cases the Government was able to trace the spill to a particular source.","start":316.685,"stop":340.704,"duration":24.02},{"text":"So while the penalty in a particular case, in this case for example $250, might be small in an

liability to the United States for clean-up and possible liability to third parties for damages to property Section 311(b)(6), the other provision that is specifically involved here, provides that the owner or operator or the person in charge of the facility -- anyone of these -- shall be assessed a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding $5,000 whenever a prohibited discharge occurs.","start":362.814,"stop":390.27,"duration":27.46},{"text":"The Coast Guard has construed this statute to require that at least some penalty be assessed in every case but the statute itself requires that the amount of the penalty within that $5,000 range be tailored according to the gravity of the particular violation, the size of the business concerned and the effect of the penalty on the ability of the owner/operator to remain in business.","start":390.27,"stop":413.474,"duration":23.2},{"text":"The civil penalty case now before the Court resulted from an oil spill at Respondent's

retention pit at the drilling facility.","start":424.633,"stop":433.237,"duration":8.6},{"text":"On March 25 the sanitarian with the State Health Department was conducting a routine inspection for other purposes nearby and noticed that oil had seeped out of the retention pit, had run down a gully and into a stream by the name of Boggie Creek.","start":433.237,"stop":449.729,"duration":16.49},{"text":"Respondent does not contest in this Court that Boggie Creek is a navigable water within the meaning of the Act or that the amount of oil discharged in this case is harmful for purposes of the Act.","start":449.729,"stop":461.63,"duration":11.9},{"text":"On the same day that the State sanitarian observed the spill the State Health Department notified Respondent of the spill, Respondent notified EPA of the spill eight days later as he was required to do order Section 311(b)(5).","start":461.63,"stop":480.706,"duration":19.08},{"text":"On June 25 Respondent submitted a more complete report pursuant to an EPA request under another provision of the Clean Water Act administered by EPA.","start":480.706,"stop":495.589,"duration":14.88},{"text":"EPA then forwarded these reports to the Coast Guard which relied upon them in assessing a civil penalty against Respondent in the amount of $500.","start":495.589,"stop":504.052,"duration":8.46},{"text":"Respondent filed an administrative appeal from this assessment, contending that the use of the required reports to assess the civil penalty constituted a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination but this appeal was denied.","start":504.052,"stop":519.621,"duration":15.57},{"text":"Respondent then filed an action in District Court seeking to enjoin enforcement of these provisions and enjoin collection of the civil penalty.","start":519.621,"stop":527.282,"duration":7.66},{"text":"The Government soon thereafter filed a collection action to recover the unpaid civil penalty.","start":527.282,"stop":535.28,"duration":8},{"text":"The District Court consolidated these two cases and denied Respondent's motion for summary judgment, again raising the Fifth Amendment issue.","start":535.28,"stop":542.188,"duration":6.91},{"text":"The court then determined that Respondent -- that the oil spill at Respondent's property had violated the Act but reduced the civil penalty that had been assessed in the amount of $500 by the Coast Guard to $250, for two reasons.","start":542.188,"stop":555.816,"duration":13.63},{"text":"One, what the court believed to be the relatively insubstantial amount of oil that had been spilled, although it was still a violation of the Act.","start":555.816,"stop":563.335,"duration":7.52},{"text":"And, secondly, taking into account what the court believed was Respondent's diligence in cleaning up the discharge.","start":563.335,"stop":571.164,"duration":7.83},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed the award of the civil penalty to the United States.","start":571.164,"stop":575.844,"duration":4.68},{"text":"Despite Congress' expressed designation of the penalty as civil the Court of Appeals perceived certain punitive aspects to it and therefore determined that it was criminal.","start":575.844,"stop":586.301,"duration":10.46},{"text":"The court did not enjoin enforcement of the civil penalty provision or the required notice provision of the Act but simply applied immunity providing that the required notice and information derived from that notice could not be used in assessing either the liability for or the amount of the civil penalty.","start":586.301,"stop":605.348,"duration":19.05}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
