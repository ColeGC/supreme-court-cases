from a much larger number of well-qualified applicants is free voluntarily to take into account the fact that a qualified applicant is black, Chicano, or Asian, or Native American in order to increase the number of qualified members of those minority groups trained for the educated professions and participating individual, professions from which minorities were long excluded because of generations of pervasive racial discrimination.","start":28.48,"stop":79.497,"duration":51.02},{"text":"The answer which the court gives was determined perhaps for decades whether members of those minorities are

prior to the adoption of minority admissions programs.","start":79.497,"stop":108.988,"duration":29.49},{"text":"The three facts realities which dominated the situation that the Medical School of
