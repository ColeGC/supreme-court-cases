Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Barrett I think it's -- in your legislative history discussion you will also take up the time sequence at which the statute was drafted and the time at which special parole was introduced as a concept under the statute.","start":166.298,"stop":180.988,"duration":14.69}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Lloyd Barrett","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes I will Mr. Justice Rehnquist.","start":180.988,"stop":184.039,"duration":3.05},{"text":"Turning first to the statutory scheme, special parole exists as a punishment quite distinct from the punishment of imprisonment.","start":184.039,"stop":192.815,"duration":8.78},{"text":"It's provided as an additional and separate penalty to be served after full service of a prison term.","start":192.815,"stop":199.723,"duration":6.91},{"text":"Now, special parole is subject to no maximum limit so that it can and often does exceed the prison term in length.","start":199.723,"stop":208.315,"duration":8.59},{"text":"This is important because of the -- revocation -- revocation rule which is then upon revocation special parole a new and additional prison term is substituted in the amount of the entire special parole term without credit for time served.","start":208.315,"stop":223.141,"duration":14.83},{"text":"Now, it's therefore a substantial penalty and Congress authorized its inclusion selectively by a separate provision in each statutory paragraph to finding a crime to which special parole would be applied.","start":223.141,"stop":236.968,"duration":13.83},{"text":"Now, quite a number and indeed the majority of the drug crimes provide for imprisonment without specification or without mention of any special parole and significantly the crime of the continuing criminal enterprise which is the most serious trafficking offense in the Federal Drug Law does not specify a special parole term.","start":236.968,"stop":255.95,"duration":18.98},{"text":"And similarly there is no specification of special parole in the offenses involving trafficking by persons who are registered under the drug law.","start":255.95,"stop":263.757,"duration":7.81},{"text":"Generally the parole -- special parole authorizations occur in the distribution and possession offenses to find in Section 841, but even here there is selectivity.","start":263.757,"stop":274.795,"duration":11.04},{"text":"Two of the six -- two of the six punishment sections in Section 841 do not provide for special parole.","start":274.795,"stop":284.258,"duration":9.46},{"text":"Now, in practice, there is never been any question that a drug section which does not make any mention of special parole is not entitled to include as sentenced special parole with one exception, and that of course the Section 846 which is the issue that's presently before the Court.","start":284.258,"stop":301.857,"duration":17.6},{"text":"From the standpoint to the statutory scheme, we -- we feel at this unique treatment quoted in Section 846 which some -- which some circuits at least have given Section 846 makes no sense like the other sections throughout the drug law which do not make -- mention of special parole and which special parole does not apply, Section 846 describes it's punishments in terms of imprisonment and fine exclusively.","start":301.857,"stop":325.62,"duration":23.76},{"text":"Unlike these other section, Section 846 is a separate criminal section under which sentences are imposed.","start":325.62,"stop":331.765,"duration":6.14},{"text":"The purported distinction for it's -- Section 846 which the Government offers to justify the inclusion of Section -- of special parole in Section 846 notwithstanding the absence of special parole authorization is that the conspiracy section refers to the statutory section of the object offense to set the limits of punishment applicable to the particular conspiracy.","start":331.765,"stop":354.547,"duration":22.78},{"text":"And the Government contends that this reference results in the incorporation into Section 846 of any special parole that would be required in the object defense section where sentence is imposed under that section.","start":354.547,"stop":366.974,"duration":12.43},{"text":"We feel this argument by the Government misperceives the significance and the function of Section 846 specification of imprisonment and fine.","start":366.974,"stop":377.096,"duration":10.12},{"text":"Section 846 refers to the object offense sections to set the amount, but not the type of the punishment authorized, Section 846 itself sets the type of punishment.","start":377.096,"stop":388.028,"duration":10.93},{"text":"The accuracy of this reading is supported by the House Report which accompanied the bill which is ultimately enacted by the Congress and -- and in that report, in a description of the operation of the conspiracy section and the -- and the penalty for conspiracy, the House Committee I believe it's the Interstate and Foreign Commerce, stated -- described the punishment as imprisonment and/or fine which may not exceed the maximum amount set for the object offense and -- and as this statement indicates the imprisonment and fine close of Section 846 defines the type of punishment which is to be imposed for that section.","start":388.028,"stop":427.959,"duration":39.93},{"text":"A proof that Section 846 is -- referencing structure which is again the basis of the Government's distinction, a proof that it is referencing structure does not justify any special treatment is clear from another section of the drug law.","start":427.959,"stop":440.492,"duration":12.53},{"text":"Now, that's the section that's numerically proceeds Section 846 -- Section 845.","start":440.492,"stop":444.679,"duration":4.19},{"text":"It's set forth in Footnote 25 of our brief at page 20 and that's the distribution to minor section.","start":444.679,"stop":451.238,"duration":6.56},{"text":"Now, Section 845 like Section 846, uses reference to another sections sentencing limits but there's a very significant distinction of the face of the two statutes.","start":451.238,"stop":462.94,"duration":11.7},{"text":"Whereas Section 846 as I've indicated specifies, in one clause, imprisonment or fine or both, Section 845 has two clauses.","start":462.94,"stop":470.554,"duration":7.61},{"text":"The first clause specifies a reference for imprisonment and fine, and that in that sense reassembles Section 846, but there is a separate second clause which provides for the incorporation of special parole.","start":470.554,"stop":484.608,"duration":14.05},{"text":"I have more to say that Section 845 in my legislative history discussion but for the present it bears noting that Section 845 shows that the characteristic that I've identified in the drug law, and that is -- that before special parole is included in the section, there must be a specific -- special parole authorization in the individual section.","start":484.608,"stop":506.332,"duration":21.72},{"text":"That Section 845 shows that that -- that characteristic or that rule applies to sections which used referencing and that therefore Section 846 should not be treated unusually, it should be treated like all the other sections throughout the drug law which do not makes specific reference to special parole, it should be in other words no special parole should be authorized.","start":506.332,"stop":527.416,"duration":21.08},{"text":"And looking out the legislative history, the legislative history confirms that's the specification of imprisonment and fine in Section 846 was intended to define a punishment which would not include special parole.","start":527.416,"stop":540.74,"duration":13.32},{"text":"In particular, two points are established in legislative history.","start":540.74,"stop":544.374,"duration":3.63},{"text":"First, as the sections which like this conspiracy section used referencing to another section to establish the amount of penalty available, Congress recognized the need for a separate special parole authorization in a section employing the reference if that section was to include special parole.","start":544.374,"stop":563.163,"duration":18.79},{"text":"And the second thing that the legislative history demonstrates is that Congress added special parole clauses to other sections which employed this referencing, but it did not so add a special parole clause to Section 846.","start":563.163,"stop":578.168,"duration":15}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, is it fair to infer from your argument that before Congress introduced the concept to the special parole into this rewriting of the drug law, 846 clearly manifested the intent that one who was -- attempted or conspired to violate the law should be punished in the same manner as the one who committed the substantive offense.","start":578.168,"stop":606.359,"duration":28.19}]},{"speakerName":"Steven Lloyd Barrett","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't think so.","start":606.359,"stop":607.397,"duration":1.04},{"text":"I -- I think that that is happenstance of the way the -- the initial bills were drafted, but I think that there are -- are two important reasons why we should not find that the original formulation of the bills before the inclusion of special parole indicates an intent to have -- if I could use the Government's word in this congruence between the two sections, the conspiracy section and the operative section.","start":607.397,"stop":634.847,"duration":27.45},{"text":"The -- the first reason why has to do with the -- the structure of the new drug law.","start":634.847,"stop":643.017,"duration":8.17},{"text":"In the former law, conspiracy was within the -- the specific substantive sections and in every bill considers for the new law, conspiracy was withdrawn from the substantive section and established in its own section.","start":643.017,"stop":658.7,"duration":15.68},{"text":"Now, we feel that -- if you look trough other penal sections throughout the United States Code, you find that when conspiracy is separated from the substantive offense, generally the sentences provided are disparate rather than congruent.","start":658.7,"stop":678.497,"duration":19.8},{"text":"And that you find congruence in a sense in -- in cases in which the conspiracy section is allowed to remain within the substantive offense section.","start":678.497,"stop":686.567,"duration":8.07},{"text":"Now, I'm not suggesting that when Congress, the 91st Congress removed conspiracy from the substantive offense section.","start":686.567,"stop":692.733,"duration":6.17},{"text":"In this case, it was intending to create this word -- sentences or necessitates the finding of these current sentences.","start":692.733,"stop":698.231,"duration":5.5},{"text":"What I'm saying, is that it was originally in a situation where congruence was necessitated and it was thereafter placed in a situation were traditionally congruence was not found and I think to that sort of refutes the thought that Congress was thinking specifically in terms of establishing congruence.","start":698.231,"stop":715.998,"duration":17.77}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
