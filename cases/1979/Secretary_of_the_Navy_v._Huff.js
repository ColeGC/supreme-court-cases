Glines, in which the Court just heard argument.","start":56.447,"stop":62.252,"duration":5.81},{"text":"The respondents brought this case as a class action on behalf of all Marine Corps personnel stationed at the combat-ready Marine Corps Air Station at Iwakuni, Japan.","start":62.252,"stop":74.596,"duration":12.34},{"text":"Here as in Brown v. Glines, respondents sought declaratory and injunctive relief against military regulations that require the prior approval of the base commander before petitions may be distributed on base, and here as in Brown v. Glines, the Court of Appeals held that the regulations are invalid under 10USC 1034, as applied to the on-base distribution of petitions to members of Congress.","start":74.596,"stop":100.576,"duration":25.98},{"text":"The Court of Appeals limited its holding both to the statutory issue and to the Iwakuni Base

about the statute.","start":112.754,"stop":116.633,"duration":3.88},{"text":"First, that it was designed to protect private individual communications rather than group petitioning.","start":116.633,"stop":123.006,"duration":6.37},{"text":"We think the legislative history on that is clear.","start":123.006,"stop":126.809,"duration":3.8},{"text":"Second, even if group petitioning were communication within the meaning of the statute, the Navy and Air Force regulations do not restrict the communication of such petitions to Congress.","start":126.809,"stop":139.876,"duration":13.07},{"text":"The military's unwillingness to open military facilities to public activities traditionally prohibited is not a restriction on the communication of the petition itself.","start":139.876,"stop":151.539,"duration":11.66},{"text":"If the Court agrees with either of those submissions, it need not reach the third issue under the statute which I will discuss at this time.","start":151.539,"stop":160.804,"duration":9.27},{"text":"Assuming for the purposes of discussion that the regulations in some sense restrict the communication of petitions to Congress, the statute allows restrictions imposed under regulations that are necessary to the national security.","start":160.804,"stop":176.225,"duration":15.42},{"text":"The only legislative history concerning this particular language in the statutes refers, of course, to individual

the words in the statute might permit for group petitioning, and that is because Congress didn't think the statute applied to this group petitioning activity.","start":197.068,"stop":211.014,"duration":13.95},{"text":"But the Court of Appeals both here and in the Glines case recognized that the regulatory objective of insuring a discipline prepared military force is essential to national security.","start":211.014,"stop":223.153,"duration":12.14},{"text":"The courts held, however, that the prior approval requirement is necessary to achieve this objective only in a combat zone, and that outside a combat zone post-distribution punishment is sufficient.","start":223.153,"stop":238.156,"duration":15},{"text":"The implication of the court's reasoning as we see it is that the need for troops to be fully prepared for immediate action is materially less outside a combat zone than within one.","start":238.156,"stop":249.177,"duration":11.02},{"text":"But the problem with that reasoning is that as a practical matter it is unrealistic.","start":249.177,"stop":254.536,"duration":5.36},{"text":"The military cannot know today and doesn't know today where troops stationed at the strategic air base in Guam involved in the

cases.","start":281.962,"stop":291.456,"duration":9.49},{"text":"General Brown said in his affidavit that was filed in the Huff case that an effective military force cannot be prepared only on the eve

combat itself.","start":302.133,"stop":309.961,"duration":7.83},{"text":"Well, there wasn't any contrary evidence, expert or otherwise, in the record.","start":309.961,"stop":314.678,"duration":4.72},{"text":"But the Court of Appeals simply disagreed with the military assessment.","start":314.678,"stop":319.721,"duration":5.04},{"text":"It's difficult, we concede that it's difficult to know with certainty what is necessary in any particular situation to insure military preparedness.","start":319.721,"stop":329.429,"duration":9.71},{"text":"As Judge Leventhal said in an analogous context, in Culver v.
