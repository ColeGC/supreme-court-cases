here.","start":265.448,"stop":284.518,"duration":19.07},{"text":"Through Title VII, Congress has created certain rights to be free from discrimination in private employment including for the first

can proceed through the administrative processes of Title VII and ultimately perhaps the federal court and at the same time proceed immediately to federal court under 1985 (3) creating a very real

42.","start":398.888,"stop":408.905,"duration":10.02},{"text":"In this case, we're talking about 1985 (3) being read to take a right created by Title VII and thereby invalidate the administrative

1985 (3) would not apply to anything beyond equal employment opportunities.","start":430.884,"stop":440.417,"duration":9.53},{"text":"There's no holding back the thrust of the Third Circuit's opinion.","start":440.417,"stop":444.802,"duration":4.39},{"text":"The thrust -- the logical trust of that opinion is to extend 1985 (3) to any federal substantive statute irrespective of whether such
