concerns a very narrow question of whether police officers will be permitted to stop motor vehicles for the sole limited purpose to conduct a license and a registration check.","start":20.317,"stop":37.762,"duration":17.45},{"text":"The facts of this particular case are not in dispute.","start":37.762,"stop":41.516,"duration":3.75},{"text":"On November 30th 1976, an officer at Newcastle County Police Department stopped a motor vehicle in which the respondent Mr. Prouse was an occupant.","start":41.516,"stop":54.251,"duration":12.74},{"text":"The stop was motivated solely to check for a driver’s license and registration of the driver of that vehicle.","start":54.251,"stop":61.816,"duration":7.57},{"text":"There was no other wrongdoing or facts

Delaware to the Delaware Supreme Court.","start":80.454,"stop":91.353,"duration":10.9},{"text":"On January 30th 1978, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Trial Court’s ruling and holding that random stops without articulable facts to justify a reasonable suspicion that there is evidence of wrongdoing or unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.","start":91.353,"stop":113.613,"duration":22.26},{"text":"The State of Delaware respectfully disagrees with that holding and sought certiorari in this Court.","start":113.613,"stop":121.834,"duration":8.22},{"text":"In so ruling, the Delaware Supreme Court specifically recognized that there was a legitimate state interest in the enforcement of its motor vehicle laws.","start":121.834,"stop":132.751,"duration":10.92},{"text":"Furthermore, the Delaware Supreme Court noted that it was adopting what it called a rigid invalidity rule and the state

privacy of the individual should be considered and the intrusiveness of that particular search.","start":213.726,"stop":224.078,"duration":10.35},{"text":"It’s the State’s contention that the Delaware Supreme Court erred in failure to give full consideration to these factors.","start":224.078,"stop":231.238,"duration":7.16},{"text":"That had it done so, that the interests of society would clearly have indicated that such stops should have been permitted.","start":231.238,"stop":242.848,"duration":11.61},{"text":"Initially the state would note that there is a legitimate state purpose in
