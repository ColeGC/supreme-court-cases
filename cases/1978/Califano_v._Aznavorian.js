benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program.","start":43.456,"stop":53.285,"duration":9.83},{"text":"That program was established in 1972.","start":53.285,"stop":56.598,"duration":3.31},{"text":"It was designed to consolidate and improve upon the previously existing cooperative federal state aide programs for the aged, the blind,

month.","start":95.141,"stop":107.445,"duration":12.3},{"text":"I'd like to emphasis to the outset that the Supplemental Security Income program involved in this case is a federal welfare program

Social Security old age, survivors and disability insurance program.","start":123.565,"stop":131.494,"duration":7.93},{"text":"Unlike that program which is funded out of a trust fund from employer and employee contributions the Supplemental Security Income program is funded out of general revenues and its only similarity to the Social Security Insurance program is that there both are administered

to that trip, she lost her SSI benefits for August and September of 1974.","start":182.412,"stop":189.711,"duration":7.3},{"text":"The Social Security Administration refused to pay benefits for those months because of Section 1611 (f) of the Social Security Act which is the statutory provision that's at issue in this case.","start":189.711,"stop":202.034,"duration":12.32},{"text":"Congress adopted Section 1611 (f) because it wanted to ensure that federal welfare benefits were paid only to people who actually need them to live in United States.","start":202.034,"stop":213.091,"duration":11.06},{"text":"The legislature did not forbid SSI recipients from traveling abroad provided only that where otherwise eligible persons decide to take foreign trips for an extended period of time they may not receive welfare benefits for the time they are outside the country.","start":213.091,"stop":230.203,"duration":17.11},{"text":"This

days.”","start":263.636,"stop":283.132,"duration":19.5},{"text":"Aznavorian lost her benefits for September 1974 because of the operation of this second sentence.","start":283.132,"stop":290.784,"duration":7.65},{"text":"Now, I'd like to make one thing clear about the way the second sentence of Section 1611 (f) operates before I go any further.","start":290.784,"stop":299.129,"duration":8.35},{"text":"If a person is outside the country for 30 consecutive days, he is treated as remaining outside the country until he's returned and stayed in United States for 30 consecutive days.","start":299.129,"stop":308.434,"duration":9.31},{"text":"But this does not mean that he cannot receive SSI benefits for any of that 30-day waiting period.","start":308.434,"stop":316.022,"duration":7.59},{"text":"If the 30-day waiting period expires before the end of the month, the person can receive his full SSI benefits for that month.","start":316.022,"stop":324.718,"duration":8.7},{"text":"Thus, a person who leaves for example on June 10th and returns to United States on July 20th.","start":324.718,"stop":331.665,"duration":6.95},{"text":"If he's still in the country on August 19th, 30 days later, he'll receive benefits for the full month of August.","start":331.665,"stop":338.327,"duration":6.66},{"text":"The provision is designed only to equalize treatment between people who are outside the country for a full calendar month and those who are out for a period longer than 30 days which spans two calendar months and therefore therein the country for part of each.","start":338.327,"stop":353.973,"duration":15.65}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"In your hypothetical case, he would loose benefits for one month only, is that

remedies filed as class action and allege that the suspension of SSI benefits to otherwise eligible recipients who are outside the country for 30 or more consecutive days is an improper penalty on the exercise of what she called the fundamental constitutional right to foreign travel.","start":418.698,"stop":441.523,"duration":22.83},{"text":"The District Court did not completely accept appellee's position.","start":441.523,"stop":445.554,"duration":4.03},{"text":"It observed that international travel has traditionally been subject to more controls to interstate travel and said that the right to travel internationally should not be equated or put on an equal footing with the right to travel interstate.","start":445.554,"stop":461.68,"duration":16.13},{"text":"However the Court did decide that the right to international travel is a basic constitutional right and therefore that any governmental restriction, no matter how minor on such travel must bear a fair and substantial relationship to a legitimate Government purpose.","start":461.68,"stop":477.606,"duration":15.93},{"text":"The Court concluded that Congress could have chosen less drastic means to prevent fraudulent claims for SSI benefits and to ensure that such benefits are paid only to United States residence.","start":477.606,"stop":489.358,"duration":11.75},{"text":"The Court therefore declared Section 1611 (f) unconstitutional and directed the Secretary to pay Aznavorian the benefit she would have received in August of 9th -- and September 1974 had it not been for her trip to Mexico.","start":489.358,"stop":505.302,"duration":15.94},{"text":"We believe that the District Court erred in applying this unusually stringent standard of review to Section 1611 (f).","start":505.302,"stop":512.476,"duration":7.17},{"text":"The Court has repeatedly held that statutory classifications of this kind in social welfare programs should be sustained if they bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.","start":512.476,"stop":524.301,"duration":11.83},{"text":"Indeed, in Califano against Jobst decided just last term the Court may clear that

that case, the right to marry.","start":524.301,"stop":544.609,"duration":20.31},{"text":"Another case decided last term, Califano against Gautier Torres, demonstrates the District Court's error in this case in a signing a special constitutional status to the right to travel abroad.","start":544.609,"stop":557.356,"duration":12.75},{"text":"As the Court said in Gautier Torres, the right to international travel does not enjoy the same degree of constitutional protection as the right to travel interstate.","start":557.356,"stop":566.005,"duration":8.65},{"text":"The right to travel outside the country is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and such can be regulated within the bounds of due

holding in this case.","start":577.129,"stop":583.452,"duration":6.32},{"text":"Now, the District Court cites three Supreme Court cases for its proposition that in a specially strong showing is required to justify any infringement on the right travel abroad.","start":583.452,"stop":594.998,"duration":11.55},{"text":"None of those cases support the result reached below.","start":594.998,"stop":598.639,"duration":3.64},{"text":"Kent against Dulles, the first of the cases, was a statutory interpretation case that simply held that the Secretary of State did not have the power under the statutes passed in 1952 and 1956 to deny passport solely on the basis of personal beliefs, political views, political expressions.","start":598.639,"stop":620.998,"duration":22.36},{"text":"Aptheker against the Secretary of State recognized Congress' right to regulate travel abroad but simply held that a particular

travel outside the country but upheld the constitutionality of the Passport Act of 1926 to the extent that it was interpreted to permit the Secretary of State to refuse to validate passports for persons who want to travel to particular countries if the Secretary found that such travel might be injurious to American foreign policy positions.","start":640.563,"stop":671.78,"duration":31.22},{"text":"In none of those cases that the Court indicated that there was a special standard that needed to applied any time there was an infringement on the right to travel abroad.","start":671.78,"stop":682.248,"duration":10.47},{"text":"Its worth pointing out I think that Section 1611 (f) does not prohibit any foreign travel.","start":682.248,"stop":687.377,"duration":5.13},{"text":"It's absolutely neutral with respect to trips of 30 days or less.","start":687.377,"stop":692.125,"duration":4.75},{"text":"And with respect to longer trips, the Congress has chosen to provide only that no SSI benefits will be paid for months during all of which the recipient is outside the country.","start":692.125,"stop":707.759,"duration":15.63},{"text":"As a practical matter of course, the SSI recipient's ability to travel abroad for lengthy period is -- periods is limited by financial factors that are unrelated to Section 1611 (f).","start":707.759,"stop":719.304,"duration":11.54},{"text":"In order to receive SSI benefits at all, the recipient must demonstrate that he has less than $1500 in personal resources.","start":719.304,"stop":729.914,"duration":10.61},{"text":"Foreign trips lasting longer than the 30-day period are unlikely to be within financial reach of most SSI recipients.","start":729.914,"stop":737.541,"duration":7.63},{"text":"And if such trips are made possible in some cases by the availability of accommodations with friends or relatives outside the country, this is precisely the kind of situation in which the payment of SSI benefits to persons outside the country would be inappropriate.","start":737.541,"stop":754.707,"duration":17.17},{"text":"We believe as I said before that Section 1611 (f) is rationally related to a legitimate congressional goal providing financial aide to persons who need it to live in United States.","start":754.707,"stop":767.251,"duration":12.54},{"text":"We also think as we've stated in the brief that is related to the purpose of paying SSI benefits only to United States residents, a purpose that appellees concede as a legitimate one.","start":767.251,"stop":780.232,"duration":12.98},{"text":"Section 1611 (f) makes it unnecessary for the Social Security Administration to decide each time a recipient leaves the country whether that person is abandoning his United States residence.","start":780.232,"stop":792.641,"duration":12.41},{"text":"The Social Security Administration simply stops payments after the recipient has been outside the country for a full month.","start":792.641,"stop":802.148,"duration":9.51},{"text":"And we believe that this is a rational legislative judgment that should be upheld.","start":802.148,"stop":806.485,"duration":4.34},{"text":"Now, we've also argued in our brief that the District Court's -- a word of retroactive monetary relief was improper because Congress

provision.","start":806.485,"stop":833.027,"duration":26.54},{"text":"We've also argued that the District Court's limitation of the relief to -- in currently needy members of the class was a legitimate exercise of the District Court's equitable discretion.","start":833.027,"stop":844.124,"duration":11.1},{"text":"Unless the Court has questions on first part of the brief or any of these
