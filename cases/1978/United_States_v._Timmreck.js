Court.","start":61.07,"stop":64.48,"duration":3.41},{"text":"This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.","start":64.48,"stop":70.038,"duration":5.56},{"text":"The issue is whether a defendant is entitled to collateral relief from his conviction under 28 U.S.C. 2255 merely because the district judge failed to follow the formal requirements of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accepting his guilty plea.","start":70.038,"stop":88.315,"duration":18.28},{"text":"We believe that under this Court's consistent interpretation of the scope of habeas corpus for non-constitutional errors, respondent was not entitled to Section 2255 relief as a result of this violation of the rule and that the Court of Appeals therefore erred in reversing the District Court's order denying the writ.","start":88.315,"stop":107.4,"duration":19.09},{"text":"The facts may be briefly summarized as follows.Respondent was one of 22 defendants named in a narcotics conspiracy indictment filed in the Eastern District of Michigan in May 1972.","start":107.4,"stop":121.181,"duration":13.78},{"text":"After extensive plea bargaining, respondent agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy count of the indictment.","start":121.181,"stop":128.777,"duration":7.6},{"text":"In return, the Government agreed to drop the remaining 17 substantive counts and also agreed not to pursue an unrelated bail jumping charge against him.","start":128.777,"stop":139.155,"duration":10.38},{"text":"The District Court then conducted a Rule 11 proceeding at which it questioned respondent prior to determining whether to accept his plea.","start":139.155,"stop":147.565,"duration":8.41},{"text":"There's no dispute that the Court's inquiry at this proceeding fully complied with Rule 11 in every respect except one.","start":147.565,"stop":155.978,"duration":8.41},{"text":"Although the court mentioned that if respondent pleaded guilty he could be sentenced to 15 years imprisonment and a 5 -- and $25,000 fine.","start":155.978,"stop":164.623,"duration":8.64},{"text":"The court neglected to add that responded could all -- would also be subject to a mandatory special parole term of at least three years.","start":164.623,"stop":172.576,"duration":7.95},{"text":"Four months later, respondent was sentenced to 10 years in prison, 5 years special parole, and to a $5,000 fine.","start":172.576,"stop":181.863,"duration":9.29},{"text":"Now, respondent did not appeal his conviction nor during the following two years did he signal his displeasure with any other aspect of his plea in any way.","start":181.863,"stop":192.277,"duration":10.41},{"text":"In August 1976 however, respondent moved to vacate his sentence under Section 2255, alleging for the first time that the District Court had violated Rule 11 in it -- by failing to mention the special parole term at the time of his plea.","start":192.277,"stop":209.097,"duration":16.82},{"text":"Motion is set out at page 11 of the joint appendix.","start":209.097,"stop":214.536,"duration":5.44},{"text":"It alleges only that Rule 11 was violated.","start":214.536,"stop":218.878,"duration":4.34},{"text":"It doesn't expressly state that respondent was actually unaware of the special parole provisions when he pleaded guilty and more important, it doesn't claim that respondent wouldn't have entered the exact same guilty plea if the judge had notified him on the record of the special parole requirement.","start":218.878,"stop":237.099,"duration":18.22},{"text":"In fact, the motion doesn't allege that respondent was prejudiced in any way by a violation of the rule.","start":237.099,"stop":243.74,"duration":6.64},{"text":"And the same can be said for respondent's allegations in his memorandum in support of his motion which is set out beginning at page 14 of the appendix and the oral argument that the hearing on that motion which begins at page 18 of the joint appendix.","start":243.74,"stop":260.19,"duration":16.45},{"text":"No allegation of actual prejudice.","start":260.19,"stop":263.455,"duration":3.26},{"text":"Now, the District Court denied respondent's 2255 motion.","start":263.455,"stop":266.773,"duration":3.32},{"text":"The court acknowledged that it hadn't complied fully with Rule 11 in taking respondent's plea but it concluded that respondent had -- respondent hadn't been harmed in any way by the technical error and that he therefore was entitled to Section 2255 relief.","start":266.773,"stop":282.489,"duration":15.72},{"text":"The court noted that there were strong indications in the record that respondent had been informed by his attorney of the consequences of his plea prior to pleading guilty.","start":282.489,"stop":293.16,"duration":10.67},{"text":"But that even if he hadn't in light of all the factors involved in the plea bargain, knowledge of the special parole provisions wouldn't have influenced respondent's decision to plea guilty.","start":293.16,"stop":303.462,"duration":10.3},{"text":"The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions to vacate respondent's conviction and to allow him to plead anew.","start":303.462,"stop":310.604,"duration":7.14},{"text":"The Court of Appeals didn't dispute any of the District Court's fact findings but it held relying primarily on this Court's decision in McCarthy against the United States that since Rule 11 had been violated, respondent was automatically entitled to withdraw his plea without regard to whether he was actually prejudiced by the defect or whether he had raised the Rule 11 violation on direct appeal or on collateral attack.","start":310.604,"stop":336.285,"duration":25.68},{"text":"Now, I think it would be helpful for me to begin my discussion by explaining the limits of the Government's submission in this case.","start":336.285,"stop":343.926,"duration":7.64},{"text":"We certainly don't contend that a defendant who pleads guilty is there ever foreclosed from ever attacking his guilty plea.","start":343.926,"stop":351.242,"duration":7.32},{"text":"Defendant has a number of adequate remedies.","start":351.242,"stop":353.96,"duration":2.72},{"text":"He can move to withdraw his plea before sentencing and under Rule 32 (d), withdrawal for virtually any reason is to be freely allowed at that stage.","start":353.96,"stop":363.368,"duration":9.41},{"text":"And after sentence has been imposed, the defendant may appeal his conviction and may of course raise any objections he may have to the plea taking procedure or to the plea itself.","start":363.368,"stop":374.122,"duration":10.75},{"text":"And even after the time for appeal has run and the conviction has become final, a defendant unquestionably may always attack his conviction collaterally under Section 2255 if the plea was involuntary or otherwise constitutionally defective.","start":374.122,"stop":391.206,"duration":17.08},{"text":"Our contention here is simply that a defendant who foregoes all of these remedies is not entitled to collateral relief from his conviction.","start":391.206,"stop":399.333,"duration":8.13},{"text":"Often as in this case, years after his guilty plea when all that he can show is that some portion of Rule 11 was not complied with when his plea was accepted.","start":399.333,"stop":409.089,"duration":9.76},{"text":"We believe that on collateral attack there must also be some showing of substantial prejudice to the defendant either in the sense that the Rule 11 error materially affected the defendant's decision to plead guilty or because for any other reason it would be manifestly unjust to hold him to his plea.","start":409.089,"stop":426.978,"duration":17.89},{"text":"This standard of collateral review of non-constitutional errors is one that this Court has frequently applied.","start":426.978,"stop":434.189,"duration":7.21},{"text":"And perhaps the case closest in point is Hill against the United States in 368 U.S.","start":434.189,"stop":440.482,"duration":6.29},{"text":"That case like this one involved a motion to vacate sentence under Section 2255 by a defendant who claimed that his conviction had been entered in violation of a rule of criminal procedure.","start":440.482,"stop":452.762,"duration":12.28},{"text":"The rule involved there was Rule 32 (a) which gives a defendant an absolute right to make a statement prior to sentencing.","start":452.762,"stop":461.204,"duration":8.44},{"text":"Although the court acknowledged in Hill that the right guaranteed to defendant by Rule 32 (a) was an important one and that the defect would've required vacation of the defendant's sentence if it had been raised on direct appeal, the court denied collateral relief, saying that the error was not a fundamental defect that inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.","start":461.204,"stop":485.58,"duration":24.38}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Geller, was there anything said in Hill about prejudice?","start":485.58,"stop":490.289,"duration":4.71},{"text":"I had read Hill to simply mean this is not the kind of thing for which you can have collateral relief, period.","start":490.289,"stop":496.798,"duration":6.51}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, the court could have decided Hill, I think, on the ground that, not having appealed, Hill was foreclosed from getting collateral relief.","start":496.798,"stop":505.119,"duration":8.32},{"text":"But it went on.","start":505.119,"stop":505.776,"duration":0.66},{"text":"It didn't go off on that ground.","start":505.776,"stop":507.07,"duration":1.29},{"text":"It went on to discuss what the requirements are for getting collateral relief for a non-constitutional plea and it set forth the standard that we rely on here which is that there must be a fundamental defect that inherently results in a substantial miscarriage of justice.","start":507.07,"stop":522.414,"duration":15.34}]},{"speakerName":"William H. Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"But it -- is it because the nature of the fundamental defect is such that the defect will inevitably in every case result in a denial of justice or is it a question of prejudice case by case?","start":522.414,"stop":538.511,"duration":16.1}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that there must be a case by case determination.","start":538.511,"stop":541.257,"duration":2.75}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"But when you include Stone against Powell along with Hill and Davis, in Stone against Powell there was a clear claim of a constitutional violation that would, except for some other rule be cognizable on 2255, wouldn't it?","start":598.986,"stop":612.87,"duration":13.88}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"That's right.","start":612.87,"stop":613.355,"duration":0.49},{"text":"There were other reasons aside from the scope of habeas corpus which led the court -- Stone against Powell not to grant the writ -- reasons that related to the exclusionary rule.","start":613.355,"stop":623.518,"duration":10.16}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
