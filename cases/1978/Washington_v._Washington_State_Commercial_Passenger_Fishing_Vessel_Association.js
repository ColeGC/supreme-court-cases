clause.","start":478.245,"stop":483.666,"duration":5.42},{"text":"Mr. Simmons, an Indian agent present at the negotiations explained to the Indians that and again I quote the minutes, \"The privilege

Sound.","start":586.371,"stop":600.672,"duration":14.3},{"text":"By the time the few remaining fish reach the last in line, the Yakamas, theirs is an entitlement to 50% of almost nothing.","start":600.672,"stop":609.077,"duration":8.4},{"text":"And if non-Indians take their 50% at Point No Point, the lower Sound tribes would have literally nothing.","start":609.077,"stop":615.998,"duration":6.92},{"text":"After all, if the Indians are entitled to have a 50% return of fish to their normal and accustomed grounds, the articles in the treaty which give them exclusive fishing rights on their reservations must guarantee a 100% return of fish to those reservations and thus leave nothing for anyone else.","start":615.998,"stop":638.361,"duration":22.36},{"text":"Clearly the treaties don't mandate a 50% plus allocation.","start":638.361,"stop":643.767,"duration":5.41},{"text":"But what do the treaties mean in that case.","start":643.767,"stop":647.957,"duration":4.19},{"text":"Their language implies an equal opportunity of fishery by the \"in common with\" language with special Indian
