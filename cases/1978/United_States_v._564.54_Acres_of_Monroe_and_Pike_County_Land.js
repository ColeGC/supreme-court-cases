Amendment.","start":290.412,"stop":316.054,"duration":25.64},{"text":"The Court held that it was and the Court's language talked about how it's a reasonable thing to substitute a new town for the old

Doctrine.","start":327.191,"stop":331.782,"duration":4.59},{"text":"In any event, the Third Circuit here, in its first opinion, said that the doctrine can be applicable to a private non-profit entity in certain circumstances.","start":331.782,"stop":342.335,"duration":10.55},{"text":"It described the key circumstance as one in which the facilities taken are reasonably necessary to public welfare.","start":342.335,"stop":352.015,"duration":9.68},{"text":"On remand, the trial was divided into two phases.","start":352.015,"stop":355.391,"duration":3.38},{"text":"The issue in the first phase was whether the substitute facility's measure of compensation applied to the taking of these camps.","start":355.391,"stop":363.304,"duration":7.91},{"text":"After a 10-day trial, the jury returned a verdict, by special interrogatory, finding that the doctrine did not apply here.","start":363.304,"stop":372.831,"duration":9.53},{"text":"The second phase of the trial was devoted to the issue of the fair market value of the condemned camps.","start":372.831,"stop":380.748,"duration":7.92},{"text":"Respondent sought to establish the fair market value by what is called the cost approach.","start":380.748,"stop":386.74,"duration":5.99},{"text":"That is, the reproduction cost of the camps minus depreciation.","start":386.74,"stop":392.038,"duration":5.3},{"text":"That is, the reproduction cost of the buildings minus the depreciation of the buildings plus the value of the underlying land.","start":392.038,"stop":399.532,"duration":7.49},{"text":"The Government used two evidentiary approaches to show the fair market value.","start":399.532,"stop":404.783,"duration":5.25},{"text":"One was, again, the cost approach and the other was the so-called market data approach, that is, comparable sales.","start":404.783,"stop":412.676,"duration":7.89},{"text":"The jury returned a verdict -- an award of $740,000.00 as the fair market value of the camps which was a compromise between the positions taken by the opposing sides, which, of course often happens in these cases.","start":412.676,"stop":429.627,"duration":16.95},{"text":"Respondent then took a second appeal, and the Court of Appeals reversed again.","start":429.627,"stop":433.914,"duration":4.29},{"text":"In addition to finding error in comments to the jury in closing, the Court held that the District Court's instructions on application of the substitute facility's measure of compensation have been erroneous.","start":433.914,"stop":448.302,"duration":14.39},{"text":"As the Court of Appeals restated the doctrine, it has three requirements, the property must be operated on a not-for-profit basis, there must be no ready market for the particular type of property, and the facilities must be reasonably necessary to the public welfare.","start":448.302,"stop":465.379,"duration":17.08},{"text":"That is, I should have made clear, that is the Court of Appeals restatement of what it held the first time.","start":465.379,"stop":470.591,"duration":5.21},{"text":"The Court of Appeals then went on to elucidate further what it meant and, with respect to the no-ready-market test, for example, the Court held that even if respondent could have sold its camps and even if they had a fair market value, as the jury had found that they did, this condition of the substitute facilities test was met if respondent could not have replaced the camps in the market place for a cost roughly equal to their fair market value.","start":470.591,"stop":503.447,"duration":32.86},{"text":"With respect to the third condition that the facility be reasonably necessary to the public welfare, the majority explained that what it meant by this was not really necessity, but simply that the condemned facility must “provide a benefit to the community that will not be as fully provided after the facility is taken.”","start":503.447,"stop":525.28,"duration":21.83},{"text":"Thus, the Court gave as an example, if the camps here did, as respondent contended, help to reduce juvenile crime by taking some youngsters from Inner City Philadelphia and, thus, helping to alleviate the gang problem in Inner City Philadelphia.","start":525.28,"stop":543.75,"duration":18.47},{"text":"Then, the Court said these camps will provide to the entire community of eastern Pennsylvania, not just to the campers.","start":543.75,"stop":553.045,"duration":9.29},{"text":"Judge Stern concurred in the opinion under compulsion of the Court's earlier opinion, but his opinion is essentially a dissent on the merits.","start":553.045,"stop":562.676,"duration":9.63},{"text":"Judge Rosen dissented but, from the Court's interpretation of the earlier opinion.","start":562.676,"stop":569.025,"duration":6.35},{"text":"The Court of Appeals remanded the case for a new trial pursuant to its newly articulated standards and, at that point, this Court intervened by granting certiorari.","start":569.025,"stop":580.536,"duration":11.51},{"text":"Well, the Substitute Facilities Doctrine with which we deal here and which, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has pointed out, this Court has never approved is, in any event, an exception to what this Court has made clear is the standard method of computing just compensation under the Fifth Amendment and that method, of course, if fair market value.","start":580.536,"stop":602.855,"duration":22.32},{"text":"The Court has defined just compensation as the full monetary equivalent of the property taken in the Reynolds case and, as stated in Almota, the Court earlier established the concept of market value.","start":602.855,"stop":615.619,"duration":12.76},{"text":"The owner is entitled to the fair market value of his property at the time of taking.","start":615.619,"stop":621.592,"duration":5.97},{"text":"Now, the Court has also made clear that where the property is so special that market data, such as comparable sales, may be few, resort must be had to other data to ascertain its value, this is the Miller case.","start":621.592,"stop":639.652,"duration":18.06},{"text":"And, those other approaches are, for one, the income approach, capitalization of net income, which can be used for business properties, or the cost approach, reproduction cost minus depreciation, which in fact was used here in the fair market value aspect of the trial.","start":639.652,"stop":659.371,"duration":19.72}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E. Burger","textObjs":[{"text":"It isn't very helpful to use a capitalization approach on a voice camp which --","start":659.371,"stop":663.749,"duration":4.38}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen R.

Justice.","start":663.749,"stop":669.732,"duration":5.98},{"text":"But, the Court has indicated that these approaches “may have relevance but only, of course, as bearing on what a prospective purchaser would have paid.”","start":669.732,"stop":679.89,"duration":10.16},{"text":"They are all approaches that are designed to determine fair market value.","start":679.89,"stop":686.157,"duration":6.27},{"text":"Now, the difference with the Substituted Facilities Doctrine is that it concedingly is not a method of determining value at all.","start":686.157,"stop":696.111,"duration":9.95},{"text":"It is -- or at least certainly not fair market value.","start":696.111,"stop":699.337,"duration":3.23},{"text":"It is a completely different avenue.","start":699.337,"stop":702,"duration":2.66},{"text":"As the respondents here -- as respondent here says in its brief at page 23, the doctrine is not used in conjunction with the market value approach evaluation but as an alternative to it.","start":702,"stop":713.945,"duration":11.95},{"text":"And, thus, the difference which is indicated by the facts of this case where the fair market value was found to be $740,000.00 and yet, respondent claims that the cost of substitute facilities would be $4 million or $5 million.","start":713.945,"stop":729.513,"duration":15.57},{"text":"Now, respondent has attempted to justify the use of the Substitute Facilities Doctrine here on the basis that this case is unique or at least very, very special, that it is a situation that arises infrequently.","start":729.513,"stop":749.109,"duration":19.6},{"text":"What is rare about it?","start":749.109,"stop":750.581,"duration":1.47},{"text":"Well, respondent says that this is a case in which the property's chief value is in its use, not its status in the marketplace.","start":750.581,"stop":759.311,"duration":8.73},{"text":"And this theme that the true value of this property is in its use and that that makes this case very rare and different recurs throughout respondent's brief.","start":759.311,"stop":770.966,"duration":11.65},{"text":"In the first place, we're not sure what this means, that the true value is in its use.","start":770.966,"stop":776.203,"duration":5.24},{"text":"It may means simply that the property is adopted for a particular use, in this case, camps, and that makes it particularly valuable.","start":776.203,"stop":786.844,"duration":10.64},{"text":"If that is all it means, we have no quarrel with it whatever.","start":786.844,"stop":790.088,"duration":3.24},{"text":"It is what this Court has said, for example, in the Mitchell case.","start":790.088,"stop":794.432,"duration":4.34},{"text":"Well, if it means more than that, we see nothing so rare about this case and no justification here for deviating from the principles of fair market value that this Court has laid down.","start":794.432,"stop":807.237,"duration":12.8},{"text":"If it simply means that there is a disparity here, as respondent emphasizes, between what the property owned would be seen by way of fair market value and what the property owner needs in order to preserve the use to which the property was devoted, well, that happens very commonly.","start":807.237,"stop":826.465,"duration":19.23},{"text":"It often happens that a property may be -- may suffice for its owner's use, even be uniquely well adapted for that use and yet, when it's condemned, the fair market value fall short of what the owner would have to pay to acquire a property equally suitable for carrying on that use.","start":826.465,"stop":846.754,"duration":20.29},{"text":"It may happen, for example, in the case of an old factory specially adapted for the owner's use.","start":846.754,"stop":853.221,"duration":6.47},{"text":"For example, in the Certain Property in Manhattan case, 306 F.2d 439, one of the issues involved the printing plant of a newspaper, Il Progreso, in Manhattan which was an old printing plant but very well adapted to putting out this particular newspaper.","start":853.221,"stop":872.446,"duration":19.23},{"text":"However, the evidence was that if anybody bought the property, they would tear the building down and use it for something else, that is, it -- the fair market value of the structure as a printing plant was nil, and the Court held that there would be no compensation for that structure.","start":872.446,"stop":890.811,"duration":18.37},{"text":"And, that is one example.","start":890.811,"stop":892.414,"duration":1.6},{"text":"Another example would be an old and man-shackled house, very commodious, very convenient for the family living in it, but if the house were condemned, its age -- and I suppose we're not talking about a house in Washington, D.C. but elsewhere, its age might bring it a reduced price on the market which would not suffice to buy a new house or any house of equal size and convenience.","start":892.414,"stop":918.915,"duration":26.5}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"I suppose, Mr. Barnett, you take the same
