Boles lived with Margaret Gonzales who is the claimant from 1963 to 1966, but they were never married.","start":116.832,"stop":130.72,"duration":13.89},{"text":"Their son Norman J. Boles was born in 1964.","start":130.72,"stop":136.118,"duration":5.4},{"text":"In 1966, the wage earner left Margaret Gonzales and his child and he married Nancy Boles in 1967.","start":136.118,"stop":146.148,"duration":10.03},{"text":"There were two children born in this marriage and the wage earner died in 1971.","start":146.148,"stop":153.166,"duration":7.02},{"text":"All three children are receiving children's benefits on Norman W. Boles' account.","start":153.166,"stop":160.882,"duration":7.72},{"text":"Mother's benefits are paid to the widow of a wage earner who has an entitled child in her care.","start":160.882,"stop":168.215,"duration":7.33},{"text":"For that reason, Nancy Boles is getting mother's benefits and Margaret Gonzales was denied mother's benefits because she was never married to the wage earner, eventhough her son is receiving benefits and is in her care.","start":168.215,"stop":185.521,"duration":17.31},{"text":"The District Court read this Court's decision in Weinberger versus Wiesenfeld as holding that mother's benefits are for the child to give him the care of his surviving parent.","start":185.521,"stop":198.44,"duration":12.92},{"text":"The court found that Norman J. Boles, the child, had himself been denied mother's benefits because of his illegitimacy.","start":198.44,"stop":207.622,"duration":9.18},{"text":"And that that denial was inconsistent with the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.","start":207.622,"stop":218.023,"duration":10.4},{"text":"It therefore declared Section 202 (g) of the Social Security Act, the mother's benefit provision unconstitutional to the extent that it limited benefits to widows and divorced wives.","start":218.023,"stop":234.152,"duration":16.13},{"text":"The court enjoined the Secretary from denying mother's benefits to the named plaintiffs or to the class which consists of all illegitimate children and their mothers who are ineligible for mother's benefits solely because they were never married to the wage earner.","start":234.152,"stop":251.408,"duration":17.26},{"text":"All the children in the class like Norman Boles are getting children's benefits.","start":251.408,"stop":257.731,"duration":6.32},{"text":"Their only claim is that they have been injured by the failure to pay mother's benefits to their mothers with whom they are living.","start":257.731,"stop":269.314,"duration":11.58},{"text":"The true requirements for mother's benefits, they are particularly are important here are first, that they are paid to the widow or to persons that Congress has decided should be treated as if they were widows.","start":269.314,"stop":284.119,"duration":14.81},{"text":"That of course is the marriage requirement.","start":284.119,"stop":286.932,"duration":2.81},{"text":"Second, the widow must have in her care a child getting benefits because of his relationship to the wage earner, that usually of course would be the widow's child, but it doesn't have to be.","start":286.932,"stop":300.362,"duration":13.43},{"text":"It's the child relationship to the wage earner, not to the person that is caring for him that counts.","start":300.362,"stop":307.453,"duration":7.09},{"text":"And the child's legitimacy has nothing to do with the widow's entitlement.","start":307.453,"stop":314.171,"duration":6.72},{"text":"These two requirements serve analytically different purposes.","start":314.171,"stop":319.49,"duration":5.32},{"text":"The first, the marriage requirement defines the class of those who are likely to have been dependent on the wage earner during his life.","start":319.49,"stop":330.405,"duration":10.91},{"text":"And that class includes all the people that Congress believed were most likely to have lost support when the wage earner died.","start":330.405,"stop":340.369,"duration":9.96},{"text":"But lost of support is not itself enough.","start":340.369,"stop":344.178,"duration":3.81},{"text":"The second, child in care requirement defines the group within the larger class who because of special circumstances are entitled to the replacement of lost support.","start":344.178,"stop":358.292,"duration":14.11},{"text":"If you don't show membership within this particular subgroup, then Congress felt that eventhough you may have lost support when the wage earner died, you should make up that support through your own efforts.","start":358.292,"stop":374.29,"duration":16},{"text":"Analytically, the child in care provision is very similar to the age requirement for elderly widows.","start":374.29,"stop":382.93,"duration":8.64},{"text":"The theory behind mother's benefits is that a wife with an entitled child in her care should have the same option that she had before her husband's death.","start":382.93,"stop":393.899,"duration":10.97},{"text":"That is, either to stay home, supported by her husband to take care of the children, or else to work and help to support the family.","start":393.899,"stop":405.734,"duration":11.83},{"text":"The theory is that she shouldn't lose this choice when the wage earner dies, and that's why she gets the benefits.","start":405.734,"stop":415.192,"duration":9.46},{"text":"The important point is that the class definition, the marriage requirement sets the outer limits of those Congress found likely to have lost support.","start":415.192,"stop":426.973,"duration":11.78},{"text":"It is the group definition is a limitation on the class.","start":426.973,"stop":431.203,"duration":4.23},{"text":"It defines the people within the class who are entitled to the replacement of lost support.","start":431.203,"stop":438.619,"duration":7.42},{"text":"Ms. Gonzales never married the wage earner.","start":438.619,"stop":441.771,"duration":3.15},{"text":"She can't meet any of the other tests that Congress has used to identify people who are so likely to have lost support at the wage earners death that they should be treated as though they were married.","start":441.771,"stop":454.455,"duration":12.68},{"text":"There is no indication in the record in fact that these tests were inaccurate as to Ms. Gonzales.","start":454.455,"stop":461.692,"duration":7.24},{"text":"There's no suggestion that she was in fact supported by the wage earner that she lost any support when he died.","start":461.692,"stop":471.844,"duration":10.15},{"text":"Since she doesn't belong to the class that Congress has identified as likely to have lost support, she's not entitled to benefits.","start":471.844,"stop":482.435,"duration":10.59},{"text":"This Court's cases strongly support our analysis of the statute.","start":482.435,"stop":487.439,"duration":5},{"text":"The Court has frequently accepted the Social Security Acts use of marriage to show the likelihood of support.","start":487.439,"stop":495.773,"duration":8.33},{"text":"And it has rejected claims that marriage is to inaccurate or imprecise, an indicator of the likelihood of support to serve as a basis for denying claims.","start":495.773,"stop":508.919,"duration":13.15},{"text":"And it has also refused to require that people who cannot meet some particular part of the marriage requirement should be entitled to prove that they were in fact dependent.","start":508.919,"stop":525,"duration":16.08},{"text":"And there's no reason to reach a different result here.","start":525,"stop":529.066,"duration":4.07},{"text":"The court below believed Wiesenfeld required the different result.","start":529.066,"stop":532.849,"duration":3.78},{"text":"It said that this Court held there that mother's benefits are for the child so that he can receive the care of the surviving parent.","start":532.849,"stop":541.145,"duration":8.3},{"text":"But that misreads Wiesenfeld.","start":541.145,"stop":544.044,"duration":2.9},{"text":"The court there was focusing on the class definition for mother's benefits, the definition of the individuals likely to have lost support when the wage earner died.","start":544.044,"stop":554.377,"duration":10.33},{"text":"It found that husbands as a class are as likely who have lost support when the wage earner dies as are wives.","start":554.377,"stop":562.98,"duration":8.6},{"text":"Wiesenfeld therefore supports our analysis of the statute because it recognizes that being entitled to mother's benefits depends on membership in the class likely to have lost support when the wage earner died.","start":562.98,"stop":577.784,"duration":14.8},{"text":"That's the reason that Wiesenfeld was controlling Goldfarb.","start":577.784,"stop":585.565,"duration":7.78}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.

illegitimates.","start":711.14,"stop":724.362,"duration":13.22},{"text":"It -- it seriously distorts Wiesenfeld to read it as meaning that the mother's benefit is really a child's benefit.","start":724.362,"stop":731.828,"duration":7.47},{"text":"The Wiesenfeld child was not a party to the case.","start":731.828,"stop":735.532,"duration":3.7},{"text":"The court didn't consider his lost of support or need for the replacement of lost support.","start":735.532,"stop":741.162,"duration":5.63},{"text":"He was already getting benefits based on those needs.","start":741.162,"stop":745.651,"duration":4.49},{"text":"It was the surviving husband that was claiming the benefits.","start":745.651,"stop":750.052,"duration":4.4},{"text":"It was his lost of support and his relationship to the wage earner that made him entitled to benefits.","start":750.052,"stop":757.338,"duration":7.29},{"text":"Neither is it fair to read Wiesenfeld as meaning that Social Security Act benefits are somehow designed to recognize the emotional trauma suffered by a child who loses a parent, and for that reason, entitled him to the care of his surviving parent who could not have stayed home to care for him before the death.","start":757.338,"stop":782.139,"duration":24.8},{"text":"Appellees here are not arguing that this Court's decision approving the use of

legitimacy.","start":810.937,"stop":814.803,"duration":3.87},{"text":"It's a classification based on the caretaker's likelihood of lost support that has a disparate effect on illegitimates.","start":814.803,"stop":824.439,"duration":9.64},{"text":"That's not enough to show a denial of equal protection.","start":824.439,"stop":829.195,"duration":4.76},{"text":"Appellees

on our reply brief show that the way the statute operates can only be reasonably explained in terms of the replacement of lost support.","start":838.592,"stop":848.299,"duration":9.71},{"text":"It's not a grant of benefits to mothers of legitimate children and a denial to mothers of illegitimate ones.","start":848.299,"stop":856.034,"duration":7.74},{"text":"Our example show that Congress here as

example.","start":911.972,"stop":919.232,"duration":7.26},{"text":"Appellees argument boils down to a claim that a statutory scheme that is neutral as regards to legitimacy must be turned into one that favors the mothers of illegitimate children.","start":919.232,"stop":929.966,"duration":10.73},{"text":"This favoritism is then demanded in the name of equal protection.","start":929.966,"stop":936.065,"duration":6.1},{"text":"This case presents an extreme example of the risks of seemingly minor changes in the benefit system established by Congress.","start":936.065,"stop":943.742,"duration":7.68},{"text":"First, it distorts the statutory purpose of providing benefits only to those most likely to have been supported by the wage earner.","start":943.742,"stop":954.483,"duration":10.74},{"text":"Second, the extension of benefits to an additional group means that the real purpose of the benefits may be lost.","start":954.483,"stop":964.597,"duration":10.11},{"text":"Neither the new group nor the group that Congress defined may actually get enough support to stay home to care for children.","start":964.597,"stop":973.217,"duration":8.62},{"text":"This is because the statute limits the total amount payable on any given wage earner's amount -- account in anyone
