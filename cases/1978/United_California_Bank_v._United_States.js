Blackmun","textObjs":[{"text":"What we get down to then and your approach is, it is whether the estate is a conduit, nothing more?","start":334.312,"stop":343.255,"duration":8.94}]},{"speakerName":"Ronald E. Gother","textObjs":[{"text":"In part there, in part and whether that conduit system is applicable to the 1201 (b) (2) alternative tax rate calculation, yes.","start":343.255,"stop":357.225,"duration":13.97},{"text":"Foster Lumber is no different than the Weil case in essence that you had an excess of an ordinary deduction which you couldn’t use against your alternative tax rate and that was a regular ordinary loss carry forward deduction.","start":357.225,"stop":375.182,"duration":17.96},{"text":"I’m saying that our charitable set aside deduction is an entirely different animal.","start":375.182,"stop":380.036,"duration":4.85},{"text":"That it is not an ordinary deduction that an individual taxpayer individual or corporate such as in Foster Lumber had, but it is a different type of deduction and it is more of a manifestation of this conduit theory.","start":380.036,"stop":400.101,"duration":20.06},{"text":"Also in Foster Lumber the issue was the definition of taxable income.","start":400.101,"stop":404.971,"duration":4.87},{"text":"Well, if there’s anything that is relatively clear in the Internal Revenue Code is the definition of taxable income and I don’t believe that that is in issue here at all.","start":404.971,"stop":417.272,"duration":12.3},{"text":"We say there are two basic intents of Congress here that are evident.","start":417.272,"stop":421.852,"duration":4.58},{"text":"One is that there is to be no tax imposed on that part of any capital gain which an estate realizes or any income, which an estate realizes, be it ordinary or on capital gain, which passes ultimately to a charity.","start":421.852,"stop":436.341,"duration":14.49},{"text":"642 (c) of Internal Revenue Code says that any gain, any income, any item of income gain or ordinary income which is permanently set aside for charity is entitled to a 100% deduction, even though it’s not paid out.","start":436.341,"stop":452.428,"duration":16.09},{"text":"So that we have a 100% deduction, whether we pay it or don’t pay it out in the particular year.","start":452.428,"stop":458.476,"duration":6.05},{"text":"It’s referred to as the set aside deduction.","start":458.476,"stop":461.263,"duration":2.79},{"text":"It's perfectly clear from that that intent of Congress was to exempt from tax that part of income realized by a fiduciary.","start":461.263,"stop":471.203,"duration":9.94},{"text":"The second intent of Congress, which is perfectly evident, is that capital gains were to be taxed in those years at a maximum of 25%.","start":471.203,"stop":480.934,"duration":9.73},{"text":"Now you’ve got these two intents and I believe they are perfectly reconcilable in our case and in due -- and our interpretation carries both to those out.","start":480.934,"stop":492.104,"duration":11.17},{"text":"The Government's does -- the Government’s interpretation does violence to one if not both of those.","start":492.104,"stop":498.389,"duration":6.29},{"text":"The basic issue which separates our self and the Government is best explained in the question of whether the capital gains tax base for computing the alternative tax rate under Section 1201 (b) 2 includes the gain going to the charity.","start":498.389,"stop":516.749,"duration":18.36},{"text":"This is by far the biggest area of disagreement between ourselves and the Government.","start":516.749,"stop":521.863,"duration":5.11},{"text":"Section 1201 (b) is set forth on pages 8 (a) and 9 (a) of the appendix of the Government brief.","start":521.863,"stop":528.958,"duration":7.09},{"text":"Before getting into the specific language of those sections, I think it’s essential to take -- stand back just a bit and take a look at what is the over all concept of the taxation of estates and trusts.","start":528.958,"stop":543.789,"duration":14.83},{"text":"We have a peculiar system of taxation here because we have interposed a fiduciary, a third party here.","start":543.789,"stop":550.932,"duration":7.14},{"text":"We don’t have a taxpayer and his tax.","start":550.932,"stop":553.585,"duration":2.65},{"text":"We have a fiduciary and the system, the basic system for taxation of estates or trusts is first you determine what part of the income that the fiduciary realizes is either required to be distributed or will be distributed or is distributed to a taxable beneficiary and that’s one set of income and you put that of to a side.","start":553.585,"stop":584.556,"duration":30.97},{"text":"The next is that you look to see if there is any income permanently set aside for charity, under 642 if it is, you set that aside.","start":584.556,"stop":592.816,"duration":8.26},{"text":"You're then left with a third group, a third body of income that is taxed to the fiduciary and then the question is what tax rate applies to that tax income.","start":592.816,"stop":604.175,"duration":11.36},{"text":"Now you go to Section 1201.","start":604.175,"stop":606.727,"duration":2.55},{"text":"1201 (b) says that if you have some capital gains in that year, you compute your tax in a two-step approach.","start":606.727,"stop":615.835,"duration":9.11},{"text":"You divide this taxable income that I have over here into its component parts.","start":615.835,"stop":621.025,"duration":5.19},{"text":"The first part being ordinary income, the second part being capital gain, and you do that by taking the taxable income that you had here and deduct out the part that is capital gain and on the remaining part you compute your tax at your ordinary income rate, that’s your ordinary income.","start":621.025,"stop":642.104,"duration":21.08},{"text":"The part that is capital gain, you then tax at a maximum of 25%.","start":642.104,"stop":648.389,"duration":6.28},{"text":"Now our position is that if you look at 1201 and apply it literally to what is the taxable income of the estate, our interpretation is as literal as any interpretation can be of that code section that the capital gains referred to in that section, the long-term capital gain is the long-term capital gain that’s in this part taxable to the estate.","start":648.389,"stop":673.255,"duration":24.87},{"text":"It’s not in the part that’s going out to the taxable beneficiaries.","start":673.255,"stop":676.591,"duration":3.34},{"text":"It’s not the gain that’s in the part over here for charity and the best way I think I can --","start":676.591,"stop":685.476,"duration":8.88}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"Can I

Gother","textObjs":[{"text":"I believe that’s correct.","start":704.326,"stop":705.231,"duration":0.9},{"text":"Because we have a fiduciary.","start":705.231,"stop":705.876,"duration":0.64}]},{"speakerName":"John Paul Stevens","textObjs":[{"text":"And how do you reconcile that with the fact that 1201 (b) refers to any taxpayer?","start":705.876,"stop":711.368,"duration":5.49}]},{"speakerName":"Ronald E.
