the labor board case, the Union prosecuted grievances of the unsuccessful applicants to arbitration.","start":286.544,"stop":296.163,"duration":9.62},{"text":"In these proceedings, the Union sought copies of the test materials that they are seeking in this case.","start":296.163,"stop":302.077,"duration":5.91},{"text":"And the arbitrator found in view of the wealth of material that the company did furnish, that production of the actual tests was irrelevant to this consideration of the case and also as the result of that proceeding, I think you should know that the arbitrator affected a compromise between the position of the Union and the position of the company whereby he told the company to reconsider three applicants who scored just below the 10.3 cutoff and as a result to that reconsideration, the company in fact hired one of those three persons.","start":302.077,"stop":332.288,"duration":30.21},{"text":"This then is the broad factual context in which this company has found to have violated the National Labor Relations Act.","start":332.288,"stop":340.171,"duration":7.88},{"text":"In the classical argument of this case would start with an analysis of whether the test

some marginal relevance to the Union's function.","start":352.982,"stop":364.057,"duration":11.07},{"text":"Our conclusion is still the same.","start":364.057,"stop":366.285,"duration":2.23},{"text":"The test material should not be turned over to the Union directly.","start":366.285,"stop":370.615,"duration":4.33},{"text":"Why?","start":370.615,"stop":371.982,"duration":1.37},{"text":"I think we could -- we should start with the only common premise we share with the National Labor Relations Board in this case and that is as the Board acknowledges in Footnote 25 of its brief, there is a very strong public policy in favor of preventing the compromised of employment tests through dissemination.","start":371.982,"stop":392.229,"duration":20.25},{"text":"That public policy is rooted in the common sense fair play notion, the distribution of an employment aptitude test to persons who may take the test in the future, destroys the validity of the test as a predictor of employee performance and places those who have not seen the test at a competitive disadvantage to those who have seen the test.","start":392.229,"stop":414.49,"duration":22.26},{"text":"In this common sense, fair play notion has been incorporated in standards for education and psychological tests and manuals published by the American Psychological Association which in turn have been incorporated into the EEOC guidelines on testing.","start":414.49,"stop":429.266,"duration":14.78},{"text":"Now, since the filing of our brief, the joint agency guidelines on testing, Standard I-5 of the APA standards states that for tests other than achievement test, prior knowledge of the test items can destroy validity.","start":429.266,"stop":443.003,"duration":13.74},{"text":"In Standard J-2 of those same standards states the test scores should be reported only to those qualified to interpret them.","start":443.003,"stop":451.376,"duration":8.37},{"text":"And the EEOC guidelines expressly require safeguards to protect the security of test scores.","start":451.376,"stop":458.975,"duration":7.6},{"text":"This Court on three recent occasions, the Griggs case, the Albemarle case, and the Washington versus Davis case has held that the EEOC guidelines are entitled to great difference and should be regarded as expressing the will of Congress.","start":458.975,"stop":474.184,"duration":15.21},{"text":"This Court in the Albemarle case specifically approved the EEOC's reliance on the APA standards I've just mentioned.","start":474.184,"stop":483.141,"duration":8.96},{"text":"The common sense fair play concept behind employment test security was recently underlined by the Second Circuit.","start":483.141,"stop":489.557,"duration":6.42},{"text":"In the Kirkland case where that Court struck down a District Court ruling which would have provided that any new employment test would be reviewed by the plaintiffs.","start":489.557,"stop":500.733,"duration":11.18},{"text":"The Board itself prior to this case acknowledged this common sense fair play concept when its general counsel in 1960 refused even to issue a complaint in which the Union sought to review employment aptitude test.","start":500.733,"stop":514.845,"duration":14.11},{"text":"The Board's general counsel at that time referred to the “unique character” of the test and held that an advanced inspection would permit the content of the test to be widely disseminated thus impairing the usefulness of the test.","start":514.845,"stop":529.744,"duration":14.9},{"text":"Now, the Board's sole answer to this admitted strong policy was to invent what they called a restriction.","start":529.744,"stop":538.502,"duration":8.76},{"text":"A (Inaudible) statement that the Union was not to copy the tests or disseminate them and was to return them to the company after the arbitration proceeding.","start":538.502,"stop":547.475,"duration":8.97},{"text":"No restriction at all was placed on the dissemination of the test scores linked with the name of the application.","start":547.475,"stop":554.363,"duration":6.89},{"text":"This could presumably be printed in the Detroit Free Press.","start":554.363,"stop":557.58,"duration":3.22}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.

Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"I'm puzzled by your reliance on the EEOC guidelines as compared with the Board's action here because as I recall the EEOC is not charged by law with making interpretative with actually filling in blanks in the statute.","start":592.065,"stop":608.583,"duration":16.52},{"text":"And the Board, I've always assumed had more authority than in its adjudicatory function EEOC did.","start":608.583,"stop":617.17,"duration":8.59}]},{"speakerName":"John A.
