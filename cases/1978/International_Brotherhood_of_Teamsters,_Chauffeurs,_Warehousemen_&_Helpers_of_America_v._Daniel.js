amended a six-count complaint in the District Court.","start":100.707,"stop":108.03,"duration":7.32},{"text":"Two of the counts, the first two which are before this Court were posited upon the Securities Laws.","start":108.03,"stop":114.842,"duration":6.81},{"text":"Two counts were based upon Section 302 of the LMRA.","start":114.842,"stop":119.395,"duration":4.55},{"text":"One count alleged the breach duty of fair representation under Section 9 (a) of the NLRA and one count was a pendent jurisdiction claim for state common-law

service rule.","start":147.84,"stop":157.766,"duration":9.93},{"text":"And although though the respondent in a discussion of ERISA at page 97 of his brief before this Court states, “To allow ERISA to preempt the antifraud provisions of the Federal Securities Laws would be to deny Daniel any relief whatsoever.”","start":157.766,"stop":179.604,"duration":21.84},{"text":"The respondent told the

viable.”","start":179.604,"stop":194.425,"duration":14.82},{"text":"The result of reversal in this case then would be that proceedings would continue in the District Court under the two Section 302

to the differences which may be found between the Securities Acts and the Labor statutes in the area of labor relations.","start":209.168,"stop":222.727,"duration":13.56},{"text":"The labor statutes as I refer to them are the National Labor Relations Act, the LMRA, the Welfare Pension Plan Disclosure Act and ERISA.","start":222.727,"stop":234.674,"duration":11.95},{"text":"And when using the term labor relations, may it please the Court, I am not speaking only of union management or collectively bargain plans.","start":234.674,"stop":244.08,"duration":9.41},{"text":"I am talking of the full spectrum of employer-employee relations that is, those pension plans which involved the relationship between an employer and an employee of which one is a collectively bargained pension plan.","start":244.08,"stop":261.827,"duration":17.75},{"text":"The one consensus which I believe can be found from the mass of briefs among the Courts, the parties and the amici is that the legislative history and the provisions of the Securities Acts do not mention pension plans as such.","start":261.827,"stop":276.936,"duration":15.11},{"text":"On the other hand and this is the point of our argument, the labor statutes beginning in 1935 and consistently through ERISA have discussed, considered, made discreet, cohesive and sometimes very detailed judgments as to the types of disclosure, as to the rights of actions of participants if any and as to the duties and obligations of plan trustees to the beneficiaries.","start":276.936,"stop":314.708,"duration":37.77},{"text":"A

Inland Steels, retirement rule are within the statutory scope of collective bargaining.","start":328.016,"stop":362.582,"duration":34.57},{"text":"And the National Labor Relations Board found that the debates in 1947 over those proposed Amendments were “compelling evidence” that retirement plans were within the 1935 Acts intent.","start":362.582,"stop":377.337,"duration":14.75},{"text":"The significance of this, may it please the Court, should not be lost because 1935 is the same chronological era that the 1933 and 1934 Security Acts were being put into law.","start":377.337,"stop":393.403,"duration":16.07},{"text":"So in 1935, whereas the Security Acts said nothing, Congress was speaking distinctly to the issue under the National Labor Relations Act.","start":393.403,"stop":403.045,"duration":9.64}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Of course Mr. Carmell, not every retirement plan is a product of collective

wouldn't have involved any of the rights and liabilities under the National Labor Relations Act or the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, isn't that

bargaining.","start":433.84,"stop":443.281,"duration":9.44},{"text":"That is 8 (5) of the old Act in 1935 Act, an 885 of the present Act, only refers to those -- only encompasses mandatory subjects

to explain, that was Congress' deliberate choice and is most fully canvassed in this Court's decision in Malone as to the specific choices that Congress made but I would like to address once more your specific point.","start":486.162,"stop":500.815,"duration":14.65},{"text":"I am not saying that the NLRA covered only collectively bargained plans.","start":500.815,"stop":507.315,"duration":6.5},{"text":"I am saying that Congress considered retirement plans and the Inland Steel Plan had been in existence for a long period of time before that as being a subject for collective bargaining.","start":507.315,"stop":518.653,"duration":11.34},{"text":"So whereas the Court of Appeals said that the reason why Congress and the Securities Acts did not consider pension plans or I mention them was that they were rather innocuous in number, the same Congress relatively was considering them to be sufficient importance to be considered within mandatory subjects of bargaining as opposed to permissive subjects of bargaining.","start":518.653,"stop":543.82,"duration":25.17},{"text":"1947 as Your Honor's already pointed out, saw Congress enact Section 302 (c) (5) and I think the significance of Section 302 Your Honors is that Congress made a deliberate choice.","start":543.82,"stop":559.013,"duration":15.19},{"text":"It shows only to regulate collectively bargained pension plan as Mr. Justice Stewart stated.","start":559.013,"stop":564.866,"duration":5.85},{"text":"Although it had before it considerations of other issues and it shows then to only regulate the structure of the plan and certain of the extent of the purposes which the funds could be used.","start":564.866,"stop":580.55,"duration":15.68},{"text":"A very, very limited regulation by Congress but a very deliberate regulation as this Court discussed in Arroyo versus the United States.","start":580.55,"stop":589.296,"duration":8.75},{"text":"But, the Welfare and Pension Plan Disclosure Act, the proceedings from 1954 on which were fully canvassed in this Court's decision in Malone are really the most significant, I believe.","start":589.296,"stop":601.964,"duration":12.67},{"text":"Because Malone stated that Congress entered “a nearly unregulated pension field.”","start":601.964,"stop":609.703,"duration":7.74},{"text":"And Congress heard from numerous witnesses beginning in 1955 including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commissioner Godwin agreed with Senator Allott in 1955 that “The Securities and Exchange Commission would comment to this particular field only by accident, so to speak, by virtue of the fact that for example in some of these plans stock is offered.”","start":609.703,"stop":637.12,"duration":27.42},{"text":"After Congress heard all of the witnesses including the Commission, it issued a Senate Report which is quoted and I won't go through it all the pages 29 and 30 of our brief stating they just didn't think there was any federal regulation of these plans but shows not to regulate its substantively but as this Court noted just to allow filings.","start":637.12,"stop":661.055,"duration":23.93},{"text":"By 1972 Your Honors, we all know, as this discussion in Manhart indicates, Congress had completely changed its mind and had completely made a complete turnaround as far as the priorities and that therefore under ERISA detailed the timing nature and disclosure that was to be made to plan participants and for the first time under Section 502 (a) granted a limited right of suit by a plan participant and granted a conjunctive right to sue with the Secretary of Labor.","start":661.055,"stop":703.094,"duration":42.04},{"text":"1958, Welfare and Pension Plan Disclosures Acts failure to include a private right of action was not an accident Your Honor because as our brief has shown, it rejected proposals by Professor Metlzer and Cox that would have established the analogous right of action.","start":703.094,"stop":724.452,"duration":21.36},{"text":"ERISA's

with Congress's action in this field.","start":734.507,"stop":741.251,"duration":6.74},{"text":"It felt the plan participants deserve more.","start":741.251,"stop":744.826,"duration":3.58},{"text":"It

circumstances, these case I believe and the courts below stands for the proposition that a court can expand through the province of the Securities Acts to enact that type of legislation which for almost 37 years that Congress deliberately refused to enact to give protection to plan participants that Congress would not give and to posit causes of action with Cong -- which Congress disclaimed.","start":758.803,"stop":797.394,"duration":38.59}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, it wouldn't -- you would -- wouldn't you agree that Judge Tone's concurring

factor.","start":819.779,"stop":830.72,"duration":10.94},{"text":"I don't know why Judge Tone's opinion did not end with our dissent because I believe it was written up to that point so it sounded that way.","start":830.72,"stop":840.069,"duration":9.35},{"text":"So, I cannot define that Your Honor but I don't believe that full consideration was given to the labor statutes, the line, the cohesive line from the labor statutes on one side and the absence of anything definitive on the other side.","start":840.069,"stop":859.969,"duration":19.9},{"text":"As I said Your Honor the reverse -- please the Court, the reversal of this case does not end the case.","start":859.969,"stop":865.543,"duration":5.57},{"text":"It will leave Mr. Daniel and his class of plaintiffs with four causes of

critical.","start":888.215,"stop":892.713,"duration":4.5},{"text":"I believe that the appendix does show only a -- the brief does show a statement that was contained in one of the palm booklets that your benefits terminate if you take a withdraw card.","start":892.713,"stop":904.188,"duration":11.48},{"text":"For the purposes of this case, Mr. Justice Stevens, we are accepting the fact that he

months.","start":904.188,"stop":918.735,"duration":14.55},{"text":"I don't believe that the question of the application of the break in service rule is relevant to the Securities Acts counts because

plans.","start":952.931,"stop":975.522,"duration":22.59},{"text":"Certainly the reason for not mentioning pension plans could not have been as the court below suggested that there was such a rare bird

Labor Relations Act.","start":1004.497,"stop":1027.723,"duration":23.23},{"text":"It is not our point that this was a subject for special legislative concern on the collective bargaining

which collective bargaining, it's, of course, just one aspect.","start":1036.357,"stop":1053.091,"duration":16.73},{"text":"We believe the reason why one finds no mention whatever of pensions in the Securities Laws is that as this Court said in Forman, the Congress's focus in enacting those laws was to deal with the capital markets of the enterprise system and to regulate the sale of securities
