held Section 1110 of procedural statute unconstitutional on its face because it failed to require an attorney ad litem for a child in any suit affecting a child under the Emergency Statute, the Conservatorship Statute or the Termination Statute.","start":187.203,"stop":207.35,"duration":20.15},{"text":"We are only appealing that as to the necessity for an ad litem at the emergency hearing,

termination.","start":207.35,"stop":228.067,"duration":20.72},{"text":"They held in three sections, 1111, 1705, and 1706, that all were unconstitutional is failing to require an adversary hearing

those.","start":243.223,"stop":246.655,"duration":3.43},{"text":"They held section 1115 unconstitutional on its face as to the standard of proof saying clear and convincing evidence is required instead of preponderance, we are appealing that.","start":246.655,"stop":259.196,"duration":12.54},{"text":"They held 1702 unconstitutional and that saying, it was unconstitutional on its face, but saying that immediately, the statute says, a child that is seized will immediately will be taken before a court or this agency seizing the child will immediately obtain a judicial sanction if you will to have possession of the child.","start":259.196,"stop":284.362,"duration":25.17},{"text":"They interpreted that to mean that the, that immediately is the “very day” of the taking we are appealing

of the court below, because there is no question that all reasonable efforts should be made and were made in this instance to notify the parents of the proceedings and in fact they had actual notice.","start":308.43,"stop":326.595,"duration":18.17},{"text":"They held section 3405 unconstitutional on its face as failing to require notice and a hearing for the parents before any psychological or psychiatric examination of the children, we are not appealing that, that wasn't even an issue in this case.","start":326.595,"stop":345.626,"duration":19.03},{"text":"Physical examination was an issue in this case and the court made no adverse holding as to that.","start":345.626,"stop":353.138,"duration":7.51},{"text":"They also held the child abuse neglect reporting enquiry system unconstitutional as applied and that the state had provided for a central registry of cases of suspected abuse and those cases on that registry were not limited to instances in which a judicial determination as to the abuse have been made.","start":353.138,"stop":379.104,"duration":25.97},{"text":"Finally they held 3408 unconstitutional on its face.","start":379.104,"stop":384.835,"duration":5.73},{"text":"That being the confidentiality provision and held it unconstitutional and so far as it did not provide for parents to be notified of the contents of the records that the state had on them, alright or requiring the states upon request to reveal the contents of the record except for informance, we are not appealing that.","start":384.835,"stop":407.229,"duration":22.39},{"text":"One other thing, which I think is confusing, also is that the Woods case it's my understanding it's not before this court.","start":407.229,"stop":417.537,"duration":10.31},{"text":"It was consolidated on a limited issue of the right of indigence to reporting counsel and in their decision in this case and the judgment the court below said that consolidation was ill-advised.","start":417.537,"stop":435.968,"duration":18.43},{"text":"We did not in our brief anyway cite to you what became of that case.","start":435.968,"stop":443.501,"duration":7.53},{"text":"The court allowed the state courts to proceed and in December of 1976 some two or three months, after the decision in this case was rendered the Court of Civil Appeals reversed the judgment and restored the children to Mrs. Woods that decision is reported at 545 Southwest second 573, that reversal was based on an insufficiency of the evidence kind of question.","start":443.501,"stop":476.681,"duration":33.18},{"text":"That I hope gets me into what I would like to talk about regarding abstention, because in that case the Woods case the State Courts were allowed to function, were allowed to go ahead through their normal processes and what happened is that the parents want to talk about abstention, it's also necessary to spend just a little bit of time on a chronology of the events that occurred.","start":476.681,"stop":511.837,"duration":35.16},{"text":"On March 25th 1976 there was a report of child abuse at the
