itself says that the regulation hasn't violated but that's part and parcel of the larger argument that we make here today that an agency regulation, the violation of a regulation standing alone does not give anyone any legal rights that are enforceable to court.","start":563.069,"stop":584.528,"duration":21.46},{"text":"It's our position which I hope to elaborate on later the

internal government regulation?","start":651.352,"stop":673.987,"duration":22.63},{"text":"First, there are several -- few answers to these questions seem reasonably

officers from its provisions.","start":714.712,"stop":722.654,"duration":7.94},{"text":"Finally, the Court of Appeals didn't purport to be ordering the suppression of evidence here as an exercise of

Dulles.","start":897.716,"stop":905.451,"duration":7.74},{"text":"But as the Court pointed out last term in Board of Curators against Horowitz, that line of cases merely announces a rule of federal
