ceiling benefits pursuant to Section 6 (b) (1) shall apply to survivors receiving death benefits.","start":454.205,"stop":465.397,"duration":11.19},{"text":"It further provides that as the phased-in

receive their initial award in that year.","start":465.397,"stop":484.944,"duration":19.55},{"text":"Thus if a person were to receive a survivor or disability award in the year where the ceiling was 125% of national average wages, three years later when the ceiling moved up to 200% of national average wages, their compensation would be adjusted up to that new

computation was relevant only to the determination of minimum benefits.","start":516.618,"stop":535.731,"duration":19.11},{"text":"The Court said that Section 6 (d) merely assures that minimum benefits are adjusted annually to reflect inflation.","start":535.731,"stop":544.971,"duration":9.24},{"text":"This construction of Section 6 (d) deprives the provision of any meaning.","start":544.971,"stop":550.767,"duration":5.8},{"text":"In amending, the Act in 1972, Congress adopted the additional recommendation of the National Commission and provided in Section 10
