question we believe the Fifth Circuit overlooked was whether there was in fact a violation of due process because there was in fact a warrant for their arrest.","start":699.838,"stop":712.837,"duration":13},{"text":"The Fifth Circuit reasoned from the reversed side of the case by concluding that being demonstrated after the fact that he should not have been arrested therefore it was a false imprisonment, that false imprisonment is an intentional tort and under their own case of Bryan versus Jones, it can be read to suggest that the only thing necessary for this tort is that someone was in fact confined.","start":712.837,"stop":738.926,"duration":26.09},{"text":"He was aware of his confinement and suffered injury by it.","start":738.926,"stop":742.6,"duration":3.67},{"text":"However, even under Bryan versus Jones, there was a preliminary finding and that is that there was a confinement without any process and it may be that under Monroe versus Pape, we can presume intent to confine without process when there is in fact no process.","start":742.6,"stop":763.653,"duration":21.05},{"text":"But it seems a little farfetched to presume intent to confine without process when there was in fact process naming the person arrested.","start":763.653,"stop":774.696,"duration":11.04},{"text":"Second difficulty with the Fifth Circuit's initial approach to the case is that they concluded that Sheriff Baker could be held responsible for the acts of his deputies and because it was necessary in this case to attribute the acts of the deputies to Sheriff Baker if he was to have liability.","start":774.696,"stop":800.156,"duration":25.46},{"text":"They did so by simply suggesting that he is responsible for the acts of his deputies.","start":800.156,"stop":804.941,"duration":4.79},{"text":"He authorized them to go so then in fact, he committed the confinement.","start":804.941,"stop":809.941,"duration":5},{"text":"Again, we find it rather difficult to conclude that Sheriff Baker intended to confine the man when his first action upon learning that this particular man was confined was to investigate and release him.","start":809.941,"stop":823.384,"duration":13.44},{"text":"And the only way we can get to Sheriff Baker on the confinement is to apply the doctrine of respondeat superior which we believe this Court should as well as in the city cases in Monell should extend your conclusion there that doctrine of respondeat superior should not apply to sheriffs either.","start":823.384,"stop":845.605,"duration":22.22},{"text":"Respondents would take one further step and say that the sheriff in Texas is responsible for the acts of his deputies.","start":845.605,"stop":852.017,"duration":6.41},{"text":"And he is statutory responsible for supervising his deputies and can be held as a surety for them but it would not be reasonable to use this is a basis for extending respondeat superior to the sheriff because then it would tend to make 1983 a variable statute depending on what state statutes happen to apply in any given jurisdiction.","start":852.017,"stop":878.217,"duration":26.2},{"text":"The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that there might be some question here on respondeat superior so they then shifted their analysis to the sheriff and suggested that it should be the sheriff's own acts or conduct.","start":878.217,"stop":891.298,"duration":13.08},{"text":"The sheriff did not act affirmably in any way to confine or restrain respondent.","start":891.298,"stop":899.274,"duration":7.98},{"text":"Therefore, they suggested that it was a failure to act, a failure to have implemented a policy of transmitting
