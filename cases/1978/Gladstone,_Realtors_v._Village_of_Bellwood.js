purchase or rent a home through the services of any of the defendants in this case.","start":315.205,"stop":334.733,"duration":19.53},{"text":"Based upon that discovery, the defendants proceeded to

Realty.","start":388.617,"stop":395.599,"duration":6.98},{"text":"In that case, the Ninth Circuit had held that a cause of action under Section 3612 exists only for a direct victim of a prescribed practice under Section 3604.","start":395.599,"stop":409.498,"duration":13.9},{"text":"The court went on to hold that the Village of Bellwood had not suffered any cognizable injury.","start":409.498,"stop":414.927,"duration":5.43},{"text":"Subsequently, Judge Perry in the Hintze case adopted Judge Decker’s decision and the case went on appeal to the Seventh Circuit.","start":414.927,"stop":422.762,"duration":7.83},{"text":"There the Seventh Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs themselves had not been denied the right to purchase or rent housing without regard to race, because the plaintiffs did not possess a good faith interest to enter into the housing market and the plaintiffs’ allegations to the contrary in the complaint had been foreclosed by their admissions through the discovery process.","start":422.762,"stop":446.503,"duration":23.74},{"text":"Therefore, testers qua testers did not have a cause of
