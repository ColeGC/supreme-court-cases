is does the federal patent law preempt the state law and prevent enforcement of a contract calling for continuing royalties on a previously secret article simply because no patent was issued and the article is no longer a secret.","start":296.081,"stop":318.354,"duration":22.27},{"text":"Now we submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals here constitutes an unnecessary interference by the federal courts with the normal application of state contract law.","start":318.354,"stop":333.121,"duration":14.77},{"text":"That interference was not required by nor even consistent with the federal patent law.","start":333.121,"stop":339.84,"duration":6.72},{"text":"I intend to deal primarily with the error of the Court of Appeals with respect to the federal patent law.","start":339.84,"stop":347.73,"duration":7.89},{"text":"We believe also that there is nothing inconsistent about enforcing this agreement with the federal antitrust laws or the policy of free and

three points.","start":366.528,"stop":369.817,"duration":3.29},{"text":"First, that this case is governed by the rule laid down by this Court in Kewanee Oil versus Bicron.","start":369.817,"stop":377.501,"duration":7.68},{"text":"Secondly; that the Court of Appeals failed to apply that test, and thirdly, if that test is applied to the state contract law involved
