interpreted the Natural Gas Act when it held that it would be inconsistent with the Act for the Commission to approved as a just and reasonable rate above the otherwise applicable ceiling rate and for the Commission thus to pass through to interstate pipelines and hence to the consuming public incremental royalty costs based on the price of natural gas in the unregulated intrastate market.","start":87.299,"stop":129.103,"duration":41.8},{"text":"Respondents Shell and Pennzoil produced gas from a field in Southern Louisiana and sell it in interstate commerce under certificates

produced.","start":162.239,"stop":168.606,"duration":6.37},{"text":"In each case, the value is to be calculated at the market price or the market rate prevailing at well.","start":168.606,"stop":177.29,"duration":8.68},{"text":"Shell and Pennzoil had always computed and paid their royalties as fractions of the market rates that they actually received by selling the gas to United, rates in which since this Court's 1954 decision in the Phillips case have been set by the Commission.","start":177.29,"stop":196.933,"duration":19.64},{"text":"Thus in 1975, the

Williams and to pass through these increases to United.","start":262.622,"stop":276.467,"duration":13.84},{"text":"The royalties provided for in the settlement were royalties based on, that is the

highest rate set by the Commission whichever was higher that is whichever the 78 cents or the 150% of the Commission rate was higher.","start":293.478,"stop":308.237,"duration":14.76},{"text":"As an alternative, the settlement provided that Shell and Pennzoil would ask the Commission for permission to abandon the portion of the gas that was attributable to the royalty interest that is one-eighth or one-fourth so that that gas could be paid to Williams as a royalty in kind for sale by Williams, wherever Williams wanted to sell it presumably in the intrastate market.","start":308.237,"stop":332.88,"duration":24.64},{"text":"Shell and Pennzoil then duly took this agreement to the Commission seeking its

revenues.","start":350.102,"stop":368.003,"duration":17.9},{"text":"The judge found that Pennzoil had made no attempt to make any such cost showing and that while Shell had made such an attempt, Shell had failed.","start":368.003,"stop":377.331,"duration":9.33},{"text":"The judge found in particular that if Shell were to pay royalties based on the 78-cent rate in the settlement, Shell will still
