recent relaxation of the mutuality of estoppels rule and can't now be so-estopped.","start":353.863,"stop":381.616,"duration":27.75},{"text":"We believe also that that result is squarely consistent with this Court's decisions in Beacon Theatres, Dairy Queen, and other cases and that the Rachal decision, the Fifth Circuit decision in 1970 which, until this case, was the only case which presented an interface or a challenge to the Seventh Amendment by the new concept of non-mutual estoppel which had held to the contrary that a jury trial could not be extinguished by this mechanism, quite
