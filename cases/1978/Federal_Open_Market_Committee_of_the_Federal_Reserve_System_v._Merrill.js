Rehnquist","textObjs":[{"text":"The section that you are dealing with the exemptions beginning this section does not apply to matters that are, and then 5 says inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than the agency and litigation with the agency.","start":171.965,"stop":187.878,"duration":15.91}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":187.878,"stop":188.071,"duration":0.19}]},{"speakerName":"William H.

under civil discovery.","start":191.685,"stop":202.03,"duration":10.35},{"text":"I think this Court is held that on several occasions.","start":202.03,"stop":204.013,"duration":1.98},{"text":"Now I hope to get to that a little later in the argument.","start":204.013,"stop":206.108,"duration":2.09},{"text":"And of course, since civil discovery the court would get engage frequently in a balancing process when it’s not dealing with documents that are subject to an absolute privilege or documents not subject to any privilege whatsoever, there is a whole middle ground in which you has to weigh the competing interests.","start":206.108,"stop":220.806,"duration":14.7},{"text":"We claim that the same analysis should apply under the Freedom of Information Act.","start":220.806,"stop":224.971,"duration":4.16}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Geller, why we have to interrupt it, there is a stay order still in effect.","start":224.971,"stop":229.252,"duration":4.28}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"The stay order is still in effect, that’s correct.","start":229.252,"stop":233.401,"duration":4.15},{"text":"Now before turning to the specific FOIA exemption that we claim is applicable in this case, which is Exemption 5, I’d like begin by briefly explaining the importance of the open market committees policy functions, how the domestic policy directives relate to those functions and why the premature release of these sensitive documents would severely frustrate implementation of the committee’s policies.","start":233.401,"stop":257.637,"duration":24.24},{"text":"Federal Reserve System is of course the nation’s central bank, and it helps to achieve the country’s economic goals through its influence on monitory policy that is the availability and cost of bank reserves, bank credit and money.","start":257.637,"stop":272.705,"duration":15.07},{"text":"System essentially has three main goals and three main tools with which to accomplish these goals.","start":272.705,"stop":279.435,"duration":6.73},{"text":"First is the setting of the discount rate, which is the rate that charge member banks on borrowing from the regional Federal Reserve Bank.","start":279.435,"stop":288.319,"duration":8.88},{"text":"The second tool is the Board’s power to change reserve requirements that is the percentage of reserves that member banks must hold in back of deposits.","start":288.319,"stop":299.303,"duration":10.98},{"text":"The finally monitory tool of the system and the one that concern us here today is the power to engage and so called open market operations, that is the purchase or sale of large amounts of securities, principally United States Government Securities in the open market.","start":299.303,"stop":316.885,"duration":17.58},{"text":"Simply stated, when the Federal Reserve System buy securities, it increases the total volume of bank reserves, because the Fed’s payment for the securities is ordinarily deposited in the seller’s bank account and it’s credited to that bank’s reserve account in its regional reserve bank.","start":316.885,"stop":336.467,"duration":19.58},{"text":"Conversely, when the system sells securities, the sales price typically is deducted from the reserve account of the buyer’s bank, and this decreases the volume of reserves held by that bank.","start":336.467,"stop":348.653,"duration":12.19},{"text":"Now these changes in the volume of the bank reserves obviously influence the ability of these banks to make loans and investments, which in turn has a substantial effect on the availability of money and the level of interest rates.","start":348.653,"stop":362.21,"duration":13.56},{"text":"The open market operations tool is by far the Federal Reserve System’s most important monitory policy instrument.","start":362.21,"stop":371.238,"duration":9.03},{"text":"Open market operations are extremely flexible unlike the other tools that I’ve mentioned and they need to be used to the extent and only to the extent necessary to accomplish the system short or long-term monitory policy goals.","start":371.238,"stop":385.991,"duration":14.75},{"text":"As a result, while the discount rate and reserve appointments are changed only occasionally, the Fed enters the market on virtually every business today and either buys or sells millions of dollars worth of securities depending upon what monitory goal it’s trying to accomplish.","start":385.991,"stop":403.389,"duration":17.4},{"text":"Now the organ of the Federal Reserve System that’s responsible for directing these open market operations is the petitioner in this case, the Federal Open Market Committee.","start":403.389,"stop":412.794,"duration":9.4},{"text":"Committee is composed of 12 members, the 7 Governors of the Federal Reserve board and 5 representatives of the Regional Reserve Banks.","start":412.794,"stop":420.846,"duration":8.05},{"text":"Committee meets approximately once a month.","start":420.846,"stop":423.557,"duration":2.71},{"text":"Its meetings begin with a run down of general economic developments and a consideration of what economic developments might arise in the immediate future.","start":423.557,"stop":433.402,"duration":9.84},{"text":"At the end of the meeting, the system decides what its plans for the open market operations in the upcoming month should be.","start":433.402,"stop":441.076,"duration":7.67},{"text":"These plans are embodied in the domestic policy directive, the subject of this litigation, which is adopted by the open market committee at the conclusion of its monthly meeting.","start":441.076,"stop":452.068,"duration":10.99}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E. Burger","textObjs":[{"text":"Who can under your theory, legitimately have access to that information now?","start":452.068,"stop":458.99,"duration":6.92}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"During the one month period that the domestic policy directive is in effect, only employees of the Federal Reserve System with the need of access to that directive have access to that directive, which would be the Account Manager who actually does the buying and selling of the open market – of securities in the open market.","start":458.99,"stop":477.263,"duration":18.27}]},{"speakerName":"Warren E. Burger","textObjs":[{"text":"In the area (Voice Overlap) how many people?","start":477.263,"stop":479.981,"duration":2.72}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"I would say it’s just a handful of people and generally high officials of the Federal Reserve System.","start":479.981,"stop":488.342,"duration":8.36},{"text":"It’s a very small number of people that have actual access to domestic policy directive during the one month of its effectiveness.","start":488.342,"stop":497.045,"duration":8.7},{"text":"Now the directive takes the form of instructions to the system’s Account Manager in New York.","start":497.045,"stop":504.593,"duration":7.55},{"text":"He is an official of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and he does the actual buying and selling of the securities in the open market.","start":504.593,"stop":511.411,"duration":6.82},{"text":"These instructions state what the Federal Open Market Committee’s general monitory policy goals for the upcoming month are and what’s more important; the directive also specifically notes what the committee’s objectives are for the rate of growth of the nation’s money supply and what the permissible fluctuation of the so called Federal Funds Rate in the upcoming months is according to the committee.","start":511.411,"stop":535.68,"duration":24.27},{"text":"The Federal Funds Rate is the interest rate that member banks charge each other for overnight loans and it’s an extremely sensitive of an accurate parameter of tightness or ease in the economy in regard to the availability of the money.","start":535.68,"stop":551.588,"duration":15.91},{"text":"The Account Manager begins to implement the directive immediately upon its adoption.","start":551.588,"stop":557.663,"duration":6.08},{"text":"The committee has always kept these domestic policy directives confidential during the one month period of their effectiveness.","start":557.663,"stop":565.437,"duration":7.77},{"text":"The current practice is to delay disclosure of the directive until a few days following the next month’s committee meeting.","start":565.437,"stop":575.176,"duration":9.74}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Geller, do you think that knowledgeable observers of the market reactions will know what‘s going on after a few days however when the Fed gets into the market?","start":575.176,"stop":586.722,"duration":11.55}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"I don’t think so, they can make -- knowledgeable market observers can make educated guesses based upon the Account Manager’s buying or selling of securities in the open market on a daily basis, but there is a certain level of uncertainty that attaches to their observations.","start":586.722,"stop":602.819,"duration":16.1},{"text":"This uncertainty that wouldn’t exist if the directive was made public, and that uncertainty is very important because it dampens the economic activity and it prevents these market observers from entering the market in a major way.","start":602.819,"stop":616.416,"duration":13.6},{"text":"But more important, I don’t think they’re just looking at the Account Manager’s daily buying or selling would give you an accurate picture of what the directive is likely to be, because most of Account Manager’s daily buying or selling may not pursuant to the directive.","start":616.416,"stop":631.762,"duration":15.35},{"text":"In other words, it may not be for the purpose of accomplishing the goals set forth in the directive; it may be simply a response to something that’s happened that day in the market.","start":631.762,"stop":641.205,"duration":9.44},{"text":"Let me give an example.","start":641.205,"stop":643.627,"duration":2.42},{"text":"Let’s assume that for a number of reasons there is a temporary glut of money in the market and may be because of the changes in treasury balances at the Federal Reserve Banks or because of the float.","start":643.627,"stop":654.852,"duration":11.23},{"text":"There is more money in the market than the Fed expected.","start":654.852,"stop":660.184,"duration":5.33},{"text":"Now when that happens, interest rates might be expected to drop, because more money is available.","start":660.184,"stop":667.443,"duration":7.26},{"text":"The Account Manager seeing these developments might well decide to sell securities; in other words, to take money out of the market.","start":667.443,"stop":676.394,"duration":8.95},{"text":"Now, this would not be for the purpose of raising interest rates.","start":676.394,"stop":679.847,"duration":3.45},{"text":"It would be merely to keep interest rates constant in a situation in which they might otherwise drop, so that if someone merely looked at what the Account Manager did in the market that day which is to sell large amounts of securities; he might get the impression that the directive is telling the Account Manager to attempt to raise interest rates whereas that wouldn’t be an accurate picture, the Account Manger is merely attempting to meet developments that have occurred in the market.","start":679.847,"stop":706.18,"duration":26.33},{"text":"Now as I was saying, the directive is kept secret until a few days following the next month’s meeting.","start":706.18,"stop":713.296,"duration":7.12},{"text":"At that point, the directive for the month just ended is made available to the public and it’s published in the federal register.","start":713.296,"stop":720.761,"duration":7.46},{"text":"That’s for example; the domestic policy directive adopted at the committee’s meeting on October 17th 1978, was released to the press on November 24th 1978, and was sent to the federal register on November 29th 1978.","start":720.761,"stop":737.195,"duration":16.43},{"text":"Primary reason for this delay in publication has always been the committee’s concern that advance public notice of its open market policy decisions would create excessive reactions or other disturbances in the securities market that would interfere with the committee’s ability to implement its open market decisions.","start":737.195,"stop":756.782,"duration":19.59},{"text":"There would be a so called announcement effect as market participants attempted to realize financial gains in anticipation of the committee’s purchases or sales of securities in the upcoming month.","start":756.782,"stop":768.796,"duration":12.01},{"text":"Now this is spelled out a greater length in our brief and in the affidavits made to the District Court, but let me give it quick just one example.","start":768.796,"stop":777.22,"duration":8.42},{"text":"The Federal Open Market Committee each month buys or sells literally billions of dollars worth of government securities.","start":777.22,"stop":785.812,"duration":8.59},{"text":"Let’s assume that it was known that in the month to follow, the committee intended to attempt to raise the federal funds rate, which as I said is the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other on an overnight basis.","start":785.812,"stop":797.734,"duration":11.92},{"text":"Market investors could reasonably assume if they had access to this directive, that to raise the federal funds rate, the committee would seek to decrease the available reserves, which would mean that the Fed would be engaging in the sale of large amounts of securities.","start":797.734,"stop":814.354,"duration":16.62},{"text":"On with this knowledge, it’s likely that many investors would react immediately by also selling government securities.","start":814.354,"stop":822.071,"duration":7.72},{"text":"And this would tend to depress securities’ prices and to inflate interest rates unnaturally.","start":822.071,"stop":827.7,"duration":5.63},{"text":"So I have explained in our brief these sudden movements in securities’ prices and interest rates might be larger than the committee contemplated, and might even be beyond the ability of the committee to control on occasion, but the very least, these market reactions would make it immeasurably harder for the committee to accomplish gradually what it set out to do that month.","start":827.7,"stop":849.934,"duration":22.23}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Geller, of course that’s the view of the agency, but it’s not a universally help you, is it?","start":849.934,"stop":855.636,"duration":5.7}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth

showing.","start":860.872,"stop":864.048,"duration":3.18}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Milton Friedman would disagree with this.","start":864.048,"stop":865.698,"duration":1.65}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"Excuse me, I am

disagree.","start":866.166,"stop":866.909,"duration":0.74}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, Milton Friedman’s, the statements that respondents have quoted from time to time from Milton Friedman really relates to the committee’s claim that the immediate disclosure of these domestic policy directives would allow market speculators to make immense profits on just profits.","start":866.909,"stop":885.437,"duration":18.53},{"text":"Now there is some dispute as to that, but there is I think not a great amount of dispute that the immediate release of these domestic policy directives might well hinder the committee’s ability to carry out its monitory policy goals which is of course a separate point.","start":885.437,"stop":902.056,"duration":16.62}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"I suppose these are sophisticated people dealing with the economic forces.","start":902.056,"stop":910.06,"duration":8},{"text":"I suppose if it were given, if we are promised that these policy directives would be disclosed, then the policy directive might be a little different in order to achieve the result that was desired.","start":910.06,"stop":926.775,"duration":16.72}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, it may not.","start":926.775,"stop":927.376,"duration":0.6}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Knowing that the public would know about this and that they would augment the effect and therefore the policy directives would discount that.","start":927.376,"stop":934.493,"duration":7.12}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"I think that that’s not as easily done as --","start":934.493,"stop":936.645,"duration":2.15}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, listen, this is all difficult as far as I am concerned but I am assuming we are dealing with experts.","start":936.645,"stop":940.864,"duration":4.22}]},{"speakerName":"Kenneth Steven Geller","textObjs":[{"text":"But I think Justice Stewart that your example is an excellent reason of why this type of information falls within Exemption 5.","start":940.864,"stop":949.442,"duration":8.58},{"text":"Exemption 5 as this Court said in Sears was meant to protect the ability of federal agencies to make decisions, and that ability may be hindered not only by the release of pre-decisional materials, but if someone want to get to in a minute, it can be hindered by the premature release of final decisions themselves.","start":949.442,"stop":965.934,"duration":16.49},{"text":"I think as you correctly assess if the committee knew that these directives are going to be made public prematurely in their view.","start":965.934,"stop":973.698,"duration":7.76},{"text":"They would take a lot of other measures that might well skew their decision making process.","start":973.698,"stop":978.172,"duration":4.47}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, the directive would be published in -- it would be decided upon and then it would
