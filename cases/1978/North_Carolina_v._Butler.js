Martinez.","start":376.558,"stop":386.056,"duration":9.5},{"text":"The Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed the trial court and held that the evidence on board there was insufficient to support the finding that the respondent waived his rights to counsel by written waiver or a specific oral waiver knowingly made.","start":386.056,"stop":407.024,"duration":20.97},{"text":"It is noted and called to the Court's attention that this interview was conducted by a trained agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that he rigidly followed the current FBI procedures as they appear in the brief of the Solicitor General and it is further noted that Chief Justice Warren, at pages 483 and 484, commended to all law enforcement agencies the practice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as they existed at that time with respect to interviewing suspects.","start":407.024,"stop":449.208,"duration":42.18},{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice Warren stated that the practice of the

self-incrimination.","start":493.215,"stop":513.184,"duration":19.97},{"text":"The issue in this case is as follows, interpreting this Court's decision in Miranda in the absence of an expressed oral or expressed written waiver of right to counsel prior to questioning, does Miranda allow a finding of an implied waiver of right to counsel from the totality of the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case where the suspect has been fully advised of his constitutional rights before making voluntary incriminating statements in response to this question -- to questioning.","start":513.184,"stop":551.762,"duration":38.58},{"text":"Resolution of this question turns almost entirely on the interpretation of the three passages in Miranda -- in the Miranda opinion which the North Carolina Supreme Court, relied on in finding a per se violation of Miranda.","start":551.762,"stop":571.761,"duration":20},{"text":"It is the position of the petitioner that the interpretation of the three passages relied on by the Supreme Court of North Carolina at page 474, 475, and 479 of Miranda should not lead to absurd or unintended results and transform the Miranda safeguards into wholly irrational objects, obstacles to legitimate police investigative activity, and deprive suspects of an opportunity to make an informed, an intelligent assessment of their
