for the police, frankly, not to do this.","start":534.361,"stop":538.663,"duration":4.3},{"text":"And in part one of the reasons -- well, there's two.","start":538.663,"stop":540.848,"duration":2.18},{"text":"One is the police know if this is truly in violation of the Sixth Amendment, then nothing can be used in the case-in-chief.","start":540.848,"stop":547.586,"duration":6.74},{"text":"So, at most, it is impeachment if the defendant testifies and if the defendant testifies inconsistently with whatever is elicited.","start":547.586,"stop":554.775,"duration":7.19},{"text":"But furthermore, given the line the court has drawn between Massiah and Kuhlmann and what goes on with the informant in the cell, if they can hear the statements without deliberately eliciting them, if you will, if the informant is present, the defendant wants to talk, starts chatting, they discuss the crime, those statements, the Court has held in Kuhlmann, are admissible for all purposes, because they are not a Sixth Amendment violation at all.","start":554.775,"stop":580.759,"duration":25.98},{"text":"So, the police do have some -- some strong incentives to actually try to gather the evidence, if they're going to, in a way that makes it usable in the prosecution's case-in-chief.","start":580.759,"stop":590.698,"duration":9.94},{"text":"There's much less value to having it solely for impeachment, which is always going to be speculative if it would ever going to be used.","start":590.698,"stop":597.119,"duration":6.42},{"text":"It would depend on if the defendant testifies and if he testifies inconsistently with what he has told an informant.","start":597.119,"stop":603.589,"duration":6.47},{"text":"And in that regard, there are other deterrents I'd like to mention here as well.","start":603.589,"stop":609.177,"duration":5.59},{"text":"The informant in this case, for example, in jail recognized that he did not want to be an aggressive questioner or -- or obvious as a government agent.","start":609.177,"stop":620.634,"duration":11.46},{"text":"In fact, he said, I didn't really want to ask him questions because I was afraid if he felt I was being too nosey, I might get hurt.","start":620.634,"stop":627.99,"duration":7.36},{"text":"And so, the informants have their own incentives to be careful here.","start":627.99,"stop":632.275,"duration":4.28},{"text":"And in this case, it's also important to remember that deterrence is simply one side of the balance.","start":632.275,"stop":640.231,"duration":7.96},{"text":"And the Court has said many times even if there would be some deterrent effect to extending the rule to include impeachment, that doesn't answer the question whether it should, in fact, be excluded.","start":640.231,"stop":650.67,"duration":10.44},{"text":"That still must be weighed against the costs on the other side.","start":650.67,"stop":654.205,"duration":3.54},{"text":"And the Court has numerous cases emphasizing the costs that are present on the other side of this case.","start":654.205,"stop":659.925,"duration":5.72},{"text":"Perjury by criminal defendants is a primary one, but also cases talking about the importance of allowing the jury to hear the truth and to search for truth.","start":659.925,"stop":670.067,"duration":10.14},{"text":"The jury here gets to evaluate and did, I would argue, quite effectively from Mr. Ventris' standpoint, evaluate the informant's credibility.","start":670.067,"stop":680.589,"duration":10.52},{"text":"The jury was -- was informed, cross-examination of the informant's circumstances, what benefit he received, who he was, all -- all the things they might want to know in deciding whether to believe him.","start":680.589,"stop":693.182,"duration":12.59},{"text":"His testimony went not solely but primarily to the question of who was the shooter in the murder in the case, and the jury acquitted Mr. Ventris of the murder charge.","start":693.182,"stop":704.371,"duration":11.19},{"text":"So they did not believe, at least beyond a reasonable doubt, that he in fact was the shooter.","start":704.371,"stop":708.875,"duration":4.5},{"text":"And that is precisely how this should work.","start":708.875,"stop":712.144,"duration":3.27},{"text":"We're not saying informants are always 100 percent reliable, but we're saying the Court has a long tradition, the country has a long tradition of putting this evidence in front of a jury.","start":712.144,"stop":724.052,"duration":11.91},{"text":"It's tested by crossexamination, knowledge of what the incentives are, bringing that out in front of the jury, and then the jury decides.","start":724.052,"stop":731.64,"duration":7.59},{"text":"There are many of these cases where it's -- this was a typical, one codefendant saying, he was the shooter, the other defendant saying, no, she was the shooter.","start":731.64,"stop":740.496,"duration":8.86},{"text":"And the informant simply had information that was relevant to the credibility.","start":740.496,"stop":745.298,"duration":4.8},{"text":"And that's the way it was used in this case, was as impeachment on rebuttal to evaluate Mr. Ventris's testimony and whether the jury believed him or not.","start":745.298,"stop":755.923,"duration":10.63},{"text":"The other thing I would remind the Court is we are simply saying that the rule should be no exclusion under the Sixth Amendment for impeachment purposes, but that does not mean that the normal rules of evidence and other rules of trial procedure do not apply.","start":755.923,"stop":773.384,"duration":17.46},{"text":"They do.","start":773.384,"stop":774.084,"duration":0.7},{"text":"And they might well result in the exclusion of some potential informant's testimony.","start":774.084,"stop":779.204,"duration":5.12},{"text":"So if the government were to want to put on an informant who had been convicted many times of perjury and the judge said, no, I just do not think this evidence is credible enough to even put in front of the jury, not this person, the ordinary rules of evidence and trial procedure would operate.","start":779.204,"stop":796.5,"duration":17.3},{"text":"Furthermore, as happened in this case, the judge can, and often will, give cautionary instructions, limiting instructions.","start":796.5,"stop":804.337,"duration":7.84},{"text":"All of that remains appropriate.","start":804.337,"stop":806.356,"duration":2.02},{"text":"But there's simply no reason to exclude the evidence as a matter of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.","start":806.356,"stop":812.76,"duration":6.4},{"text":"It would be inconsistent, frankly, with -- with, really, the general tone and

Harvey and Nix v. Williams.","start":812.76,"stop":826.769,"duration":14.01},{"text":"Unless the Court has further questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.","start":826.769,"stop":833.173,"duration":6.4}]},{"speakerName":"John G.
