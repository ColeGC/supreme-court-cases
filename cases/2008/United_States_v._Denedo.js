Goldsmith, military courts, as Article I courts, are strictly limited to the bases of jurisdiction conferred upon them by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ.","start":40.358,"stop":53.599,"duration":13.24},{"text":"Three related aspects of the UCMJ make clear that it does not confer jurisdiction over Respondent's coram nobis petition.","start":53.599,"stop":61.438,"duration":7.84},{"text":"First, as noted in Goldsmith, the UCMJ narrowly circumscribes military appellate jurisdiction to the findings and sentences of a court-martial conviction.","start":61.438,"stop":72.293,"duration":10.86},{"text":"That is a direct review jurisdiction.","start":72.293,"stop":74.261,"duration":1.97},{"text":"UCMJ Articles 66 and 67, which define appellate jurisdiction, do not contemplate any further review within the military appellate courts.","start":74.261,"stop":83.117,"duration":8.86},{"text":"Second, once direct

end of -- no further proceedings within the military court system as well as within the Article III court system.","start":159.248,"stop":175.944,"duration":16.7},{"text":"The Court agreed with the petitioner that Article 76 marked the end of any further proceedings within the military court system.","start":175.944,"stop":184.3,"duration":8.36},{"text":"It disagreed that it also effected a repeal of Article III habeas jurisdiction, but there was no disagreement between the petitioner, the government, and this Court in Gusik that it did mark the end of proceedings within the military court system.","start":184.3,"stop":198.773,"duration":14.47}]},{"speakerName":"Antonin Scalia","textObjs":[{"text":"Therefore, one can say that that point wasn't decided in the case,

assuming now, because we haven't gone any further than his plea, that he was so misinformed and he didn't lack diligence in failing to bring it earlier, that he was surprised by the government's action, so he was unaware and, therefore, unable to make this plea any earlier.","start":286.145,"stop":310.327,"duration":24.18},{"text":"You have given us the answer that it's too bad, he's just out

mark of process within the military justice system.","start":316.748,"stop":325.77,"duration":9.02},{"text":"What the UCMJ did is it took the prior system, which didn't even allow for real direct review within the military court system, and it made that direct review system much more robust.","start":325.77,"stop":338.763,"duration":12.99},{"text":"It added an intermediate court of review.","start":338.763,"stop":341.881,"duration":3.12},{"text":"It took administrative review that was embodied within boards of tribunals that had typically been under the Judge Advocate General.","start":341.881,"stop":348.202,"duration":6.32},{"text":"It moved that out and gave it greater independence to provide more robust intermediate appellate review.","start":348.202,"stop":353.939,"duration":5.74},{"text":"It added an entire level of a new court, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which provided additional -- a new level of review.","start":353.939,"stop":362.712,"duration":8.77},{"text":"And then it said still--","start":362.712,"stop":364.029,"duration":1.32}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony M.

maintaining good order and discipline within the armed -- within the armed forces, mindful of the military's primary mission in fighting wars and defending the nation.","start":389.862,"stop":406.158,"duration":16.3},{"text":"Now, given those competing values, it was -- it was reasonable for Congress to draw a line at some point and say it, the conviction is
