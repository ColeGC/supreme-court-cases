sales-commission plan in Atlantic.","start":840.947,"stop":850.381,"duration":9.43},{"text":"This Court will recall it as tremendous shift in business over a period of a year when the sales-commission

Atlantic, there were an impact that three levels in this case, there's only an impact at one.","start":858.25,"stop":867.952,"duration":9.7},{"text":"In Atlantic, what happened was Atlantic divided its operating territories between Goodyear on the one hand and Firestone on the other hand and thus eliminated all inter-brand competition between the two tire companies.","start":867.952,"stop":882.36,"duration":14.41},{"text":"We did not have that here.","start":882.36,"stop":884.489,"duration":2.13},{"text":"Secondly, in Atlantic, the arrangement was that each dealer was assigned to a special supply point, he had a purchase from one source of Goodyear or Firestone and that had the effect of course of eliminating all intrabrand competition between dealers in the particular rubber companies such as Goodyear in competing for the custom of a single dealer.","start":884.489,"stop":908.814,"duration":24.32},{"text":"But what we do have here and what the Commission pitches its case on is the impact on competition upon the competing suppliers of TBA.","start":908.814,"stop":921.416,"duration":12.6},{"text":"That is the people who were competing with Goodrich and Firestone to sell to the Texaco stations.","start":921.416,"stop":929.428,"duration":8.01},{"text":"The Commission pointed ruled that the differences, the factual differences between this case in Atlantic were immaterial because it said that the Texaco sales-commission on agreement and the words that used were, in its fundamental operation and effect is indistinguishable from the one held unlawful in Atlantic.","start":929.428,"stop":951.445,"duration":22.02},{"text":"The Commission interpreted this Court's Atlantic decision in effect is holding his files.","start":951.445,"stop":957.866,"duration":6.42},{"text":"It said that this Court rule that while coercive practices aggravate the restraint imposed by the sales-commission plan.","start":957.866,"stop":966.328,"duration":8.46},{"text":"It is the oil company's power over its dealers, derived from the contractual relationship between them and the utilization of that power through the performance of the promotional services required by the sales-commission agreement which renders the sales-commission plan unlawful.","start":966.328,"stop":984.129,"duration":17.8},{"text":"In other words, the Commission held here is what this Court we think recognized in the Atlantic but the basic vice of the sales-commission plan was the utilization of economic power in one market the gasoline market to restrain competition in another market, the TBA market.","start":984.129,"stop":1002.786,"duration":18.66},{"text":"And we think that the Commission properly drew that conclusion here because Texaco no less than Atlantic we think, brought its economic power over its dealers to bear in a way that gave the Goodrich Company and Firestone Company a competitive advantage over other sellers of TBA and selling to the importance segment of the TBA market that was represented by the numerous Texaco service stations which were located basically throughout most of the country.","start":1002.786,"stop":1036.534,"duration":33.75},{"text":"Now, the Commission summarized at considerable length how Texaco had used its economic power in the performance of the sales-commission contract.","start":1036.534,"stop":1047.686,"duration":11.15},{"text":"It listed; I'll refer to six instances.","start":1047.686,"stop":1050.666,"duration":2.98},{"text":"The first thing is that even before the dealer was signed up for as a dealer, the Texaco people stressed to him the importance of carrying adequate stock of TBA and also urged upon him to select either Goodrich or Firestone.","start":1050.666,"stop":1069.295,"duration":18.63},{"text":"And if he does select one of these two sponsored brands, Texaco takes the initiative and introduces him to the representative of the rubber company.","start":1069.295,"stop":1078.723,"duration":9.43},{"text":"Before the station is actually opened, Texaco frequently informs either or both of Goodrich and Firestone of the opening of such station although the record does also indicate that in many instances, the rubber companies were aware of this themselves and made the first sales pitch.","start":1078.723,"stop":1096.554,"duration":17.83},{"text":"Texaco actively promote, participates in the promotion campaigns of Firestone and Goodrich.","start":1096.554,"stop":1104.56,"duration":8.01},{"text":"At their various dealer meetings, they have training courses at those courses of the sponsored products are frequently used for the training and display purposes.","start":1104.56,"stop":1114.79,"duration":10.23},{"text":"And in addition to that, representatives of the rubber companies frequently attend this

thing in the record.","start":1124.8,"stop":1136.805,"duration":12.01},{"text":"There's evidence in the record of course that they do advertise nonsponsored products but we think as I shall develop that this is really immaterial at the critical thing is that they did play a very active role in promoting the sale of the sponsored products to their dealers.","start":1136.805,"stop":1154.069,"duration":17.26},{"text":"And finally, the Commission said, perhaps most effective of all that Texaco salesman continually carries the message in his day to day contacts with the dealers.","start":1154.069,"stop":1165.94,"duration":11.87},{"text":"In this regard is important to remember that these Texaco salesmen who were most directly involved in pushing

renewed.","start":1165.94,"stop":1185.361,"duration":19.42},{"text":"And the Commission concluded that the consequence of these promotional efforts by Texaco was to impress upon Texaco dealers through

products.","start":1185.361,"stop":1206.651,"duration":21.29},{"text":"Now, the record in this case indicates that although Texaco did inform its dealers that they are independent businessmen who had the freedom to select what other brand of TBA they wanted.","start":1206.651,"stop":1220.226,"duration":13.58},{"text":"In fact, its performance to this contract, its recommendation, its promotion, its sponsorship of the Goodrich and Firestone products did put competing distributors of TBA at a very definite disadvantage in selling to Texaco outlets.","start":1220.226,"stop":1237.327,"duration":17.1},{"text":"The Commission called 31 witnesses who are representatives of competing wholesale sellers of TBA.","start":1237.327,"stop":1245.697,"duration":8.37},{"text":"These witnesses testified basically as to the difficulties they had in selling to Texaco outlets.","start":1245.697,"stop":1253.212,"duration":7.52},{"text":"They testified that in some instances there were outlets to whom they couldn't sell at all.","start":1253.212,"stop":1257.784,"duration":4.57},{"text":"They testified as to other Texaco outlets, they would sell them on occasional item that they couldn't get them to stock the

a waste of time, they couldn't sell to them.","start":1264.532,"stop":1274.39,"duration":9.86},{"text":"And then they testified into some instances not too many admittedly but a substantial number in

brand.","start":1274.39,"stop":1293.625,"duration":19.23},{"text":"And I think the Commission fairly summarized this evidence when it said page 91 of volume 6 of this little document that we have here which contains most of the things is that -- that as a result, many Texaco dealers as result of Texaco vigorous sales campaign to its dealers, many Texaco dealers were left with the impression that Texaco would look with disfavor upon their purchase of nonsponsored TBA products and that they were acquired to purchase the sponsored TBA.","start":1293.625,"stop":1329.804,"duration":36.18},{"text":"Now, the practical effectiveness program I think is well brought out in the testimony of a man named Richard Tidwell which is set
