Phosphate Export Association.","start":108.317,"stop":127.05,"duration":18.73},{"text":"This association was organized in order to enable these members to act jointly in the overseas sales of

Administration.","start":217.907,"stop":224.504,"duration":6.6},{"text":"In that situation, GSA issued a standard invitation to bid, accepted the low bid on behalf of the United States, paid the

understanding of the transaction Mr. Justice Fortas is that the goods, the phosphate in each case were shipped from Florida to Korea but in the GSA transaction, GSA actually took legal control of the

fact here is that the funds came from the United States Treasury and that the transaction was controlled in every respect by AID.","start":409.476,"stop":422.715,"duration":13.24},{"text":"We do not think that the legal steps in the procurement differed significantly to make the legal difference between the GSA procurement and the Republic of Korea Procurement.","start":422.715,"stop":437.445,"duration":14.73}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you contend in the two cases that GSA took delivery in other words that so far as I

delivery was not effective until the phosphate arrived in the Republic of Korea, is that right?","start":452.812,"stop":466.44,"duration":13.63}]},{"speakerName":"Warren Christopher","textObjs":[{"text":"With respect to the other transactions, the Republic of Korea sought the bids in Korea, bids were made there and the phosphate was transferred I believe from the

funds expanded to the United States.","start":520.551,"stop":529.826,"duration":9.27},{"text":"However, so that the matter is fairly before the Court, I should say that when Korea sells the phosphate to private purchasers in Korea, the funds generated which are not necessarily equal to the value of United States must be set aside as counterpart funds.","start":529.826,"stop":547.742,"duration":17.92},{"text":"These funds have been used in practice mostly to support the Korean defense establishment but as I say, the stipulation makes clear that Korea is under no obligation to repay the funds expended in these procurements.","start":547.742,"stop":567.449,"duration":19.71},{"text":"In 1964, the United States filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York charging that the activities of this association constituted illegal price fixing and an allocation of business in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.","start":567.449,"stop":584.377,"duration":16.93},{"text":"The court below dismissed the complaint holding that the transactions were within the Web-Pomerene exemption.","start":584.377,"stop":591.77,"duration":7.39},{"text":"In the view of the court below, because the goods were shipped to a foreign country, the District Court thought they constituted export trade within the meaning of the Act.","start":591.77,"stop":603.22,"duration":11.45},{"text":"However, the District Court noted in its opinion that it seems obviously unfair to the United States to permit the defendants to charge and artificially set price and to deprive the United States of the benefits which might come from price competition between the association notwithstanding that statement, the District Court felt that the exports here were within the exception -- exemption of the Webb-Pomerene Act and therefore held that the Government's complaint must be dismissed.","start":603.22,"stop":637.616,"duration":34.4}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.

bids?","start":709.116,"stop":722.244,"duration":13.13}]},{"speakerName":"Warren Christopher","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, the basic purpose of the Act was to enable the American exporters to compete in foreign markets for what I would call traditional foreign business where the foreign source pays the money.","start":722.244,"stop":735.044,"duration":12.8},{"text":"Now the framers of the Act were very careful to make sure that there'll be no injury to the American consumer, to the American taxpayer.","start":735.044,"stop":743.579,"duration":8.53},{"text":"Now, I think it's that legislative purpose which illuminates the Act and which makes it clear here that where Uncle Sam pays the bill and aids and supervises the transaction that the exception does not apply.","start":743.579,"stop":757.873,"duration":14.29},{"text":"Our -- it seems to me that as we look at the Webb-Pomerene Act, we must look at the underlying reasons, we're not prisoner of the dictionary by any means, I think our obligation is to look at the history and purpose of Congress.","start":757.873,"stop":775.72,"duration":17.85},{"text":"As just indicated in my comments to Mr. Justice White, Congress was trying in this Act to give the American exporters a better chance to compete against foreign monopolies especially foreign buying cartels.","start":775.72,"stop":793.532,"duration":17.81},{"text":"The philosophy of the Act was United States business is it should be freed of antitrust restraints and their approach to foreign market.","start":793.532,"stop":801.352,"duration":7.82},{"text":"Congress thought it was acting primarily to aid small companies which had thought could not compete effectively in foreign markets unless they could act jointly.","start":801.352,"stop":811.627,"duration":10.27},{"text":"Now, the purpose of the Act in my view was frankly a very chauvinistic one.","start":811.627,"stop":816.093,"duration":4.47},{"text":"Both of them in for whom the Act is named emphasized this point.","start":816.093,"stop":820.698,"duration":4.61},{"text":"In the House, Congressman Web indicated his willingness to allow a combination between anyone or anything for the purpose of capturing export trade but only so long as it did not punish the people of the United States.","start":820.698,"stop":835.448,"duration":14.75},{"text":"In the Senate, Senator Pomerene pointedly remarked were not concerned about giving to the foreign consumer a minimum price.","start":835.448,"stop":843.896,"duration":8.45},{"text":"Indeed, the FTC report from which the Act is from emphasized that the form of organization permitted must not operate to the prejudice of the American public reflecting that chauvinism this Act authorize joint activity in circumstance where the resulting non-competitive price would be borne by a foreign country or by the people of the foreign country.","start":843.896,"stop":869.842,"duration":25.95},{"text":"But the Act in its legislative history make it clear as we read it that this joint activity was to be permitted only so long as there had been no adverse effect upon the American economy.","start":869.842,"stop":882.589,"duration":12.75},{"text":"Only so long as the American people would not be punished, the whole purpose of the Act points out we think an exclusion of those transactions whereas here the anticompetitive conduct, the joint activity might be involved would be at the expense of the American taxpayer.","start":882.589,"stop":905.149,"duration":22.56},{"text":"Congress was trying to strengthen the hand of the American exporter to be sure as Mr. Justice White said","start":905.149,"stop":911.751,"duration":6.6},{"text":"But the export trade within the contemplation of the Act in our view was the traditional export trade between America and foreign countries, American businesses trying to get business and foreign countries that will be paid for by foreign sources or by foreign governments.","start":911.751,"stop":932.554,"duration":20.8},{"text":"Now, there are powerful reasons we think in addition to the legislative history supporting the construction that we advance here.","start":932.554,"stop":942.65,"duration":10.1},{"text":"The Webb-Pomerene Act is an exception to the broad mandate of the antitrust laws.","start":942.65,"stop":949.446,"duration":6.8},{"text":"It's a familiar principle that such exceptions are to be narrowly construed.","start":949.446,"stop":955.745,"duration":6.3},{"text":"We think that this rule requires the Webb-Pomerene Act be confined to its underlying purpose and not given the expansive construction argued for here by the appellees which would involve as we see it a potential burden on the American taxpayer.","start":955.745,"stop":975.437,"duration":19.69},{"text":"We think also that the history of Government procurement points the same direction in all Government procurement; it's been a strong policy of Congress that there should be no interference with normal competition.","start":975.437,"stop":990.794,"duration":15.36},{"text":"We think that

available.","start":990.794,"stop":1001.76,"duration":10.97},{"text":"Now, Mr. Justice White one of the limitations of history is that it doesn't tell us what the circumstances would be under a

laws is that competition will produce lower prices and it is those lower prices of that competition which I believe the framers of the Act would have wanted to preserve for the American taxpayer and

believes that the presence or absence of foreign competition is not the determinative factor on this issue of statutory construction.","start":3140.67,"stop":3154.038,"duration":13.37},{"text":"The foreign competition was present here was only that competition which was permitted by AID.","start":3154.038,"stop":3161.799,"duration":7.76},{"text":"As paragraph 23 of the record indicates, page 49 of the stipulation, the only foreign purchasers that were able to participate in the bidding, I'm sorry, the only foreign companies that were able to participate in bidding were those in countries which were authorize to bid under the aid regulation.","start":3161.799,"stop":3187.552,"duration":25.75},{"text":"Basically, aid permitted companies in the underdeveloped countries and the less developed countries to bid on this procurement.","start":3187.552,"stop":3197.536,"duration":9.98},{"text":"I think this demonstrates very well how irrelevant the presence or absence of foreign competition is to determination of the statutory issue.","start":3197.536,"stop":3206.347,"duration":8.81},{"text":"AID could tomorrow ban all foreign competition and is frequently done so in connection with its procurement or its supporting of foreign countries procurement.","start":3206.347,"stop":3218.502,"duration":12.15},{"text":"In a situation where American companies had a monopoly there would be a foreign competition at all.","start":3218.502,"stop":3224.693,"duration":6.19},{"text":"And yet, the statutory question would remain the same so I think we would say that the procurement agency determines the extent of the foreign competition, the procurement agency is able to determine whether or not it wishes on a given procurement to permit foreign companies to participate in the bidding and thus, to have some of our dollars go abroad to reflect on Mr. Murphy's concern and that fact the extent to which the procurement agency permits foreign competition is I say should not and cannot be controlling on the matters of statutory construction involved here.","start":3224.693,"stop":3265.874,"duration":41.18},{"text":"Second, while we do not contend that there

case.","start":3265.874,"stop":3283.025,"duration":17.15},{"text":"The record shows that each of the defendant corporations which form this association is a company of more than a hundred million

suggest that if they were bidding against each other, the result would not have been different is I think to fail to look at the realities which lie behind the Sherman Act.","start":3297.062,"stop":3308.732,"duration":11.67},{"text":"Four of the five companies that make up this export association are in the top five in this industry.","start":3308.732,"stop":3314.817,"duration":6.09},{"text":"All five are in the top 10 and I think when you look at those facts, you have to recognize that if the bidding had been fully competitive of the American taxpayer it had the advantage of having American companies bidding against each other.","start":3314.817,"stop":3332.224,"duration":17.41},{"text":"It might have had a different result.","start":3332.224,"stop":3335.04,"duration":2.82},{"text":"So while as I say, we do not charge any fraud on the part of the defendant companies, we think this is the very pure question of statutory interpretation and an important one.","start":3335.04,"stop":3346.426,"duration":11.39},{"text":"Nevertheless, the premise of the antitrust law is I think is effective here to indicate that there should be bidding for the full competition where Government procurement dollars are involved.","start":3346.426,"stop":3362.024,"duration":15.6},{"text":"And finally, I would like to go back to Mr. Justice Fortas' questions and the points he has been making because I believe that shows, I believe they illuminate the fact that the form of this transaction should not be controlling here but rather, what should be controlling is that this is Government procurement.","start":3362.024,"stop":3383.613,"duration":21.59},{"text":"These are United States tax dollars and
