world.","start":116.524,"stop":129.398,"duration":12.87},{"text":"Upon receipt of his registration certificate, his local board on November 7th about two weeks after he had turned in his card, mailed him a delinquency notice is a stand that selective service form notifying him that he had become delinquent for two reasons: One, for failure to have his registration certificate in his possession; and two, for a failure to advise the board of his current status.","start":129.398,"stop":159.646,"duration":30.25},{"text":"At the same time simultaneously, a notice of classification was sent to the

impression.","start":220.162,"stop":225.492,"duration":5.33},{"text":"For the first time since the adoption of the conscription in 1940 and after some thousands of millions of people have been conscripted during the first quarter of the century, this case brings to the attention of this Court some of the low visibility machinery of the Selective Service System.","start":225.492,"stop":243.66,"duration":18.17},{"text":"The actual operation of this Selective Service System is of coursed controlled by the design of the regulations.","start":243.66,"stop":250.271,"duration":6.61},{"text":"And we believe that this case will reveal that the regulations involved in this case don't turns where constitutional corners.","start":250.271,"stop":259.546,"duration":9.28},{"text":"Also involved in this case is the high visibility of the National Directors of Selective Service, for we contend and the Government has agreed the General Hershey effectively invited the local boards around the country to uses Selective Service System as a means to punish dissidents from National Policy.","start":259.546,"stop":277.724,"duration":18.18},{"text":"And he thereby not only punished some dissidents from National Policy for expressing their political views but he also deterred many unknown numbers from expressing any views at all.","start":277.724,"stop":294.514,"duration":16.79},{"text":"The threshold argument in this case before we get to the merits, involved Section 10 (b) (3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, a new provision adopted by a Congress in 1967.","start":294.514,"stop":312.901,"duration":18.39},{"text":"It reads its quote, \"No judicial review

this title after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction.\"","start":312.901,"stop":335.721,"duration":22.82},{"text":"Now, the government has -- the Solicitor General has agreed with us that in the circumstances of this case the revocation of petitioners for the exempt classification was without authority because it was contrary to an express grant of the exemption by statute by Congress, and that for that reason the District Court should have granted the injunction and required petitioner's classification back into IV-D.","start":335.721,"stop":369.825,"duration":34.1},{"text":"We agree with the Solicitor General but we think that the Solicitor General's concession is too narrow.","start":369.825,"stop":377.544,"duration":7.72},{"text":"We urged upon the Court a rather broader interpretation of 10 (b) (3) the one often described as the \"special circumstances exception\", a doctrine applied to statutes which have recorded either to deny or review entirely or to limited in one way or another.","start":377.544,"stop":401.849,"duration":24.31},{"text":"The special circumstances doctrine in this case we contend that I'll come back to a more detail for the moment is that the local board acted beyond it's jurisdiction in depriving petitioner of his IV-D exemption and that to not allow petitioner to sue to regain his exempt classification will needlessly expose himself to prosecution.","start":401.849,"stop":432.557,"duration":30.71},{"text":"The second and slightly broader ground on which we would have this Court base it's decision in reversing the court below is that the whole scheme or all of the events surrounding the withdrawal of petitioner's classification violated the First Amendment and in that respect we rely on the case of Wulf versus Selective Services decided by the Second Circuit in 1967.","start":432.557,"stop":465.764,"duration":33.21},{"text":"Now, we think that the Ccourt without getting to the constitutional issue concerning 10 (b) (3) can decide the case on either of those two grounds.","start":465.764,"stop":477.195,"duration":11.43},{"text":"However, we also -- we argue that should the Court disagree with us that this is a special circumstances case or take the position that the First Amendment was not reach in the case then we say that it's necessary to examine the constitutionality of 10 (b) (3) itself which seems to require that the only way petitioner could test the validity of the withdrawal of this exemption is to refuse to report for induction and to defend any criminal prosecution.","start":477.195,"stop":517.299,"duration":40.1}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"What was the law prior to 10 (b) (3), what was the statute prior to 10 (b) (3) or wasn't there any?","start":517.299,"stop":523.563,"duration":6.26},{"text":"10 (b) (3) before the amendment said only that decisions of the local board shall be filed which was the statute as interpreted in Falbo and Estep (ph).","start":523.563,"stop":533.587,"duration":10.02},{"text":"There was no statute like the new amendment prior to its adoption.","start":533.587,"stop":541.036,"duration":7.45},{"text":"The justification that the Government or rather to Selective Service System has put forth in this case in objecting to any pre-induction litigation is what they describe as the litigious interruption of the functioning of the Selective Service System.","start":541.036,"stop":564.125,"duration":23.09},{"text":"Now, litigious interruption of functioning of Selective Service System was put forward 25 years ago in Falbo where the question was whether a registrant could raise questions about the validity of his classification in defense of a criminal prosecution.","start":564.125,"stop":585.629,"duration":21.5},{"text":"Mr. Justice Murphy concurring in Estep, sorry, in dissenting in Estep said of the Government's position there that it is alleged that to allow a full hearing and a criminal proceeding under this Act would be to extend an open invitation to all inductees to disobey their induction orders and litigate he validity of the orders in the subsequent trials.","start":585.629,"stop":606.677,"duration":21.05},{"text":"He described that it's a poor excuse for stripping petitioners of their rights to due process and thought that it was a speculative concern at best.","start":606.677,"stop":616.615,"duration":9.94},{"text":"Now Falbo specifically said that, the question there was to be cited in the context of a wartime situation where the nation's manpower was fully mobilized, that was also the background of the Estep case where as I say the only question was whether selective service registrants could raise their defenses on the criminal prosecution.","start":616.615,"stop":651.024,"duration":34.41},{"text":"Now, both of those cases arose at the wartime situation, where the nation was fully mobilized and where it's very life was at stake.","start":651.024,"stop":659.461,"duration":8.44},{"text":"The situation is entirely different today where there is no declared war and where the nation's life is not in the same degree of jeopardy as it was there in the Second World War.","start":659.461,"stop":674.551,"duration":15.09},{"text":"Judge Zirpoli in the Northern District of California who an opinion striking down 10 (b) (3) on the ground of his unconstitutional also address himself to the Government's claim about litigious interruption and he said that if the interruption was insignificant if it exist at all.","start":674.551,"stop":694.216,"duration":19.66},{"text":"He said, it would not disrupt the Selective Service System because the Court would indeed experience and that saving in time because the need for a few trials would be obviated by voluntary compliance with orders which have been judicially declared valid and sometime will be saved the trials because the issue of the orders validity probably will not have to be litigated.","start":694.216,"stop":717.294,"duration":23.08},{"text":"The Selective Service System also says in its portion of the Government's brief that pre-induction suits will interrupt selective service because they are generally filed within a few days of the induction date, that happens to be true with the -- in the case before you.","start":717.294,"stop":734.724,"duration":17.43},{"text":"It doesn't happen to be true in the general round of cases in which affirmative suits which I know that which amount to about 20 have been filed.","start":734.724,"stop":743.138,"duration":8.41},{"text":"Most of those suits have in fact been filed after reclassification and before exhaustion of the administrative appeals process during which time an induction order cannot issue.","start":743.138,"stop":759.928,"duration":16.79},{"text":"The Solicitor General also says as one of the Government's reasons for opposing pre-induction review of these cases that, \"if petitioner's induction is enjoined, someone else will have to take his place.\"","start":759.928,"stop":781.697,"duration":21.77},{"text":"As to that I would just like to point out to the Court that in the semiannual report of the Selective Service which the Solicitor General has filed with the Court yesterday, at page 13, \"the fact of the matter is that should petitioner's induction be enjoyed?\"","start":781.697,"stop":801.905,"duration":20.21},{"text":"It really wouldn't affect the Selective Service System at all because in every year since 1949 in the table at the bottom of page 13, the Selective Service System has over booked.","start":801.905,"stop":814.923,"duration":13.02},{"text":"They got a -- they -- in 1967 for example, the Defense Department asked that they induct 288,900 men they called 345,000 and inducted 298,000 which is indeed 10,000 more than the Defense Department had requested.","start":814.923,"stop":839.673,"duration":24.75},{"text":"I also want to say solely about habeas corpus as an alternative often route to criminal prosecution.","start":839.673,"stop":849.727,"duration":10.05},{"text":"We don't think that habeas is really an effective alternate because it requires that the man go with he service and perhaps in compliance with an allegedly invalid order, it requires that the subject to military law during that time is in services and during that time that his habeas is pending, it maybe that he would be after induction be transferred along the distance form his home was generally be the case away from his friends, away from the witnesses, away from the local board, away from all of the people who could testify in his behalf which would in fact make it very difficult for him to bring an effect of habeas corpus.","start":849.727,"stop":898.653,"duration":48.93},{"text":"And also, a habeas appeal during the course of a habeas appeal, he would have to be subject to all of his military duties is contrasted to the appeal on the course for a criminal prosecution or a civil proceeding where he would not be subject to military duties.","start":898.653,"stop":920.448,"duration":21.79},{"text":"The special circumstances in this case are seven.","start":920.448,"stop":924.634,"duration":4.19},{"text":"Now, these are the circumstances which we urged upon the Court as a reason and bases for granting pre-induction judicial review in those cases where the board has acted without power where it has acted beyond its jurisdiction.","start":924.634,"stop":938.49,"duration":13.86},{"text":"There are seven such special circumstances.","start":938.49,"stop":941.754,"duration":3.26},{"text":"One that the board acted contrary to the statutory exemption; two, that the board's declaration of the petitioner as a delinquent, his reclassification and his induction was unauthorized by the statute; three, that that procedure was unauthorized by the regulation; and four, that it was unconstitutional because it subjected its petitioner the punishment; and five, that the delinquency regulations are unconstitutional; six, the turning in the registration certificate is protected by the First Amendment; and
