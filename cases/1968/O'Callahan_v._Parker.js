single legal issue which we think is of profound importance to several million young Americans now in the Armed Forces of the United States in relating to the balance between civil and military jurisdiction over them.","start":23.416,"stop":44.761,"duration":21.35},{"text":"Question is a simple one.","start":44.761,"stop":46.877,"duration":2.12},{"text":"Does a Court-martial have jurisdiction in peace time to try a member of the Armed Forces charged with a civilian crime and by that, I mean, a crime which is normally cognizable in the civil courts alleged to have been committed by him off post and off duty.","start":46.877,"stop":67.542,"duration":20.67},{"text":"In this case, the crime is attempted rape but if the Government is right, it could try a member of the Armed Forces for any crime at all including securities violation, violation of the anti-trust laws or anything else.","start":67.542,"stop":83.108,"duration":15.57},{"text":"Unless the Court think that this is a far-fetched example, I learned this morning that a technical sergeant at Myrtle Airbase in South Carolina was convicted just a few days ago of the crime of income tax evasion by a Court-Martial.","start":83.108,"stop":103.889,"duration":20.78},{"text":"The relative role of the military in civilian government has been of considerable concern throughout our history and for that matter throughout the history of England.","start":103.889,"stop":115.432,"duration":11.54},{"text":"Under one hand, the Constitution provides that Congress may make rules for the Government in regulation of the land and naval forces.","start":115.432,"stop":123.213,"duration":7.78},{"text":"On the other hand, it provides for jury trial in an Article 3 Court for grand jury indictment.","start":123.213,"stop":130.217,"duration":7},{"text":"In federal cases and most states also have similar provisions, some variation on the grand jury but all of them provide for a trial before a civilian court and for a jury trial.","start":130.217,"stop":145.295,"duration":15.08},{"text":"In this kind of situation, this Court has always taken the position that in order to determine the relationship of these two apparently conflicting provisions or provisions that may conflict in our Constitution, that's it's appropriate to look into the historical context, to look at the probable intent of the framers of the Constitution and to determine on the basis of that what rule shall apply.","start":145.295,"stop":176.198,"duration":30.9},{"text":"Now, we differ somewhat with the Government on our view of the history which is not particularly surprising but as we see the history, for over a hundred years of both before and after the adoption of the Constitution, Court-martial jurisdiction was limited both in this country and in England to offenses such as decision, mutiny, striking or scorning a superior officer, tardiness for parade, failure to salute, theft from military stores and a host of other offenses daring and obvious immediate relationship to the army, many of which are not punishable in the civilian courts at all.","start":176.198,"stop":224.544,"duration":48.35},{"text":"These are the kind of offenses and the only kind of offenses listed in the Articles of War adopted by the Continental Congress in 1775, renewed in 1776 and in essence, they are the offenses for which Court-martial jurisdiction was provided in the United States in peace time up until 1916.","start":224.544,"stop":249.554,"duration":25.01},{"text":"It was in the articles of 1916, perhaps an anticipation of another war, but in any event, in 1916, for the first time, Congress provided Court-martial jurisdiction and the Articles of War for the first time defined crimes other than military crimes going to offenses such as rape, murder, assault and similar ordinary, conventional civilian offenses.","start":249.554,"stop":281.443,"duration":31.89},{"text":"Now, the framers of the Constitution obviously did not act in a vacuum as this Court has pointed out on numerous occasions both in handling jury cases such as Patton and particularly in handling military law cases such as Covert against Reid and the many cases that followed that.","start":281.443,"stop":303.941,"duration":22.5},{"text":"The people who framed the constitution were quite aware of the English Revolution.","start":303.941,"stop":310.109,"duration":6.17},{"text":"They were aware of the abuses that they themselves suffered in this very field and it may reasonably be assumed that they wrote the Constitution with this in mind.","start":310.109,"stop":322.046,"duration":11.94},{"text":"English history is I think fairly clear.","start":322.046,"stop":327.863,"duration":5.82},{"text":"In 1627, the petitioner of right addressed to Charles I, complained of the institution of Court-martial for any offense even an offense trying a soldier if that happened in the Courts of England where the civil courts were open and the petition was addressed to the king because the king had directed commissions to go forth and to try members of the Armed Forces although the civilian courts according to the petitioner were perfectly capable of trying these forces, these offenses.","start":327.863,"stop":364.355,"duration":36.49},{"text":"As a result to the petition of right, King Charles withdrew his military commissions but the subject was a matter of considerable conflict between parliament and the stewards for a good while after.","start":364.355,"stop":375.996,"duration":11.64},{"text":"In 1689, after the revolution of 1688, parliament passed the Mutiny Act which for the first time provided by act of parliament at least, trial by Court-Martial, of people in the Armed Forces and the only three offenses that were listed in the Mutiny Act were desertion, sedition and mutiny.","start":375.996,"stop":403.148,"duration":27.15},{"text":"Now, the Act was a very limited duration.","start":403.148,"stop":407.467,"duration":4.32},{"text":"The first act was passed for a single period, for over a period of one single year and Congress and the parliament did over the next century renewed the statute annually.","start":407.467,"stop":420.091,"duration":12.62},{"text":"Each time confining Court-martial jurisdiction for crimes committed within England to crimes that were clearly military in nature of the type mentioned in the Mutiny Act of 1689, the desertion, sedition and disrespect to the superior officer, that sort of thing.","start":420.091,"stop":446.322,"duration":26.23},{"text":"Now, it is true that as the English empire expanded and England took up commitments in foreign countries that Court-martial jurisdiction was exercised over crimes committed by members of the Armed Forces on civilians in foreign countries but only in foreign countries, never in England.","start":446.322,"stop":470.929,"duration":24.61},{"text":"There is some discussion in the authorities indicating and there's a case in England in about the middle of the 18th century holding that whereas Court-martial jurisdiction within England came under the Mutiny Act and therefore within the area of Congresses, of the parliament's jurisdiction, Court-martial jurisdiction oversees was within the king's prerogative and I think that by analogy, we might very well say that whereas Court-martial jurisdiction in the United States in time of peace is quite a different thing from Court-martial jurisdiction in times of war.","start":470.929,"stop":513.248,"duration":42.32},{"text":"And in time of war, Court-martial -- an extended Court-martial jurisdiction may perhaps be argued forth as coming within the war power of Congress.","start":513.248,"stop":523.597,"duration":10.35},{"text":"This particular offense and the issue presented before us was committed in time of peace.","start":523.597,"stop":528.645,"duration":5.05},{"text":"It was in 1956, it was in the territory of Hawaii, the civil courts were open, there was no war, it was one of the periods in our recent history in which there didn't to be a war and the issue is not an issue of the war power of Congress but rather an issue of the Congress' power to take away from persons in the Armed Forces the right of trial by jury and the other protections of the Constitution.","start":528.645,"stop":560.997,"duration":32.35}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.

everybody in the Armed Forces and I really have difficulty in avoiding the constitutional issue.","start":573.633,"stop":585.67,"duration":12.04},{"text":"I think and I'll come to that in a moment Your Honor that there may be several different views of the constitutional issue as Your Honor suggested in the concurring opinion in Covert but that there is a constitutional issue here, it seems to me is unavoidable.","start":585.67,"stop":602.274,"duration":16.6},{"text":"Now, when the columnist drew the Constitution, it is perfectly obvious that this was a matter of considerable importance to them.","start":602.274,"stop":609.687,"duration":7.41},{"text":"And as a matter of fact, the declaration of independence contains a reference to the fact in one of the complaints listed against the king was that he had asserted military jurisdiction over crimes committed by the Armed Forces, by the English soldiers on civilians in the United States or what was then the colony.","start":609.687,"stop":633.218,"duration":23.53},{"text":"And this was protested against and I might say that throughout history, there have been two parallel lines here.","start":633.218,"stop":641.145,"duration":7.93},{"text":"Under one hand, there has been the complaint of the civilian that the army will take jurisdiction and provide what the Constitution -- what the declaration of independence called a mock trial, thus permitting the military to abuse the civilians by trying them in accordance with presumably more lenient rules.","start":641.145,"stop":663.047,"duration":21.9},{"text":"On the other hand, there has been similar complain, I should say opposite complaint but arising out of the same context that the army will provide for the soldier a more strict and a more difficult form of punishment than he would get in the civilian courts because he does not have in the army right of trial by jury, right to a civilian court and the right to a grand jury indictment and I think the fact is that both of these things may happen and it is to avoid both of these things that we think civilian jurisdiction are to be given.","start":663.047,"stop":703.829,"duration":40.78},{"text":"Now, the articles of war adopted in 1776 remained unchanged so far as this particular subject is concerned until the Enrolment Act of 1863 in the midst of the civil war when for the first time Congress passed a statute giving some degree of military jurisdiction over crimes committed, over civilian crimes.","start":703.829,"stop":736.135,"duration":32.31},{"text":"That was specifically confined to time of war and this Court held in the Coleman case and in a series of cases that followed it that Congress intended by that statute to give jurisdiction of the military only in cases where the civilian courts were not operating.","start":736.135,"stop":757.387,"duration":21.25},{"text":"The leading case of course is Coleman against Tennessee where the issue arose as to who had jurisdiction over a crime committed by a member of the union forces in the then occupied territory of Tennessee, there were then no civilian courts operating, certainly no civilian courts of the United States.","start":757.387,"stop":775.978,"duration":18.59},{"text":"There may have been civilian courts of the confederacy operating.","start":775.978,"stop":779.824,"duration":3.85},{"text":"The Court said it would be absurd to say that a soldier in the union army could be tried by a civilian federal court, by a confederate civilian court and held that the army had military jurisdiction over that crime.","start":779.824,"stop":794.687,"duration":14.86},{"text":"But this Court has repeatedly since that time interpreted the 1863 Act applying only where armies were actually in the field and where civilian courts were not open.","start":794.687,"stop":807.7,"duration":13.01},{"text":"As I say, it was not until 1916 that the articles of war were amended to cover the -- substantially the situation that we have now.","start":807.7,"stop":819.664,"duration":11.96},{"text":"Now, although this case is one of first impression and the Court has never decided this precise issue.","start":819.664,"stop":827.528,"duration":7.86},{"text":"As a matter of fact, there are only three or four decisions even

cases.","start":845.715,"stop":851.202,"duration":5.49},{"text":"They merely went to the articles of war, noted that the articles of war did give jurisdiction over this sort of offense and proceeded from that point.","start":851.202,"stop":859.877,"duration":8.67},{"text":"I don't know of a single case and I've check the records where they're available where any of these was raised by

series of cases that were decided, most of them after the second world war.","start":866.981,"stop":881.958,"duration":14.98},{"text":"The Court touched upon a similar issue.","start":881.958,"stop":885.599,"duration":3.64},{"text":"Discussed not testified -- discussed at very great length on some of the issue namely the jurisdiction of the Court-martial over people who were not members of the Armed Forces and the history is quite familiar to this Court and I won't go into those cases now except to note that there was one theme which it seems to me ran through all of those cases and that was the very deep concern shown by all of the members of the Court to prevent too broad an extension of military jurisdiction.","start":885.599,"stop":920.14,"duration":34.54},{"text":"And the Court felt that unlike the Commerce Clause or other provisions of the Constitution, which have been given a very broad interpretation that here so far as this clause was concerned, the Constitution would be given a very narrow interpretation and that view, as I say, was expressed in the -- in Covert against Reid where the Court said every extension of military jurisdiction is an encroachment on the jurisdiction of the civil courts and more important, acts as a deprivation of the right to jury trial and other treasured constitutional protection.","start":920.14,"stop":960.297,"duration":40.16},{"text":"In Lee against Madigan, also, the Court indicated its reluctance to give military tribunals authority to try people for non-military offenses and so we are face to face with this problem now and it seems to us that on the basis of the history that we have before us there is no justification for extending jurisdiction of the Court-martial over persons who try ordinary, conventional, civilian crimes where the courts are open, perfectly capable of handling the case where there are no extraordinary circumstance such as war or some similar event to make it impossible for these people to be handed over to the civilian courts for trial and as a matter of fact, the government in its brief says that some 80% of these cases are tried in the civilian courts but apparently there are 20% that are not.","start":960.297,"stop":1015.803,"duration":55.51}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
