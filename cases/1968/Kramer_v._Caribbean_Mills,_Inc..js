absolute, complete, and bona fide and indeed there's no dispute about that as I see it that all of Panama's interest were thereby transferred and as a result of the assignment instrument, Panama had no claim, no right under that contract, no cause of action, no control over the lawsuit that ensued and concededly this was proper under the applicable law of Texas and that the law of any other state in the United States to effectuate a complete transfer of all of Panama's interest.","start":926.622,"stop":977.997,"duration":51.38},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals read however, the collateral agreement provision of the 95% bonus as indicated that somehow Panama retained some sort of a beneficial interest to our in this cause of action or in the contract claim.","start":977.997,"stop":1000.024,"duration":22.03},{"text":"Now, while this was conceded by the parties as a legitimate forum or deferred consideration, it is I suppose possible to read this as some sort of a beneficial interest of one sort of another or perhaps an assignment or collection on behalf of Panama.","start":1000.024,"stop":1024.079,"duration":24.05},{"text":"But the worst or the least can be said about this transaction with respect to the 95% interest which was to be returned to Panama was that this was an assignment or collection which is one of the most common transactions lawful transactions that is performed almost everyday in the business world which gives the assignee complete control, complete domination, complete title of whatever is assigned to him for collection and makes the assignee the real per diem interest to bring the suit and despite the fact that he is suppose to return part of that recovery or all of the recovery even in some cases back to the assignor, it does not make the assignment itself any less complete, any less lawful and is certainly does not make the transaction itself collusive under any recognized meaning of those phrases.","start":1024.079,"stop":1096.375,"duration":72.3},{"text":"It is well-established in the law that an assignment that shows an action constitutes the assignee, the proper party an interest to sue even though the instrument of assignment recites, which this one did not, that the transfer is merely for purposes of suit and obligates the assignee to account for the proceeds to another person and indeed this Court's decision in Titus versus Wallick in 306 volume of the United States reports at 282, is the leading authority on the validity of this kind of an arrangement and the Court there said that under the, it happen to be in New York transaction there that the repeated decisions of New York and it could be said of any other state, it is long been settled that an assignment which
