certiorari to the Fifth District Court of Appeal in California limited to the question of whether the conduct of a police lineup resulted in the violation of petitioner's constitutional rights.","start":39.432,"stop":56.889,"duration":17.46},{"text":"We make two contentions.","start":56.889,"stop":59.279,"duration":2.39},{"text":"First, that the actions of the police in the conduct of two lineups and a personal confrontation between the petitioner, Walter Foster and a witness to an armed robbery unnecessarily was suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistake in identification.","start":59.279,"stop":80.072,"duration":20.79},{"text":"This was a violation of Mr. Foster's rights under due process of law.","start":80.072,"stop":85.858,"duration":5.79},{"text":"The second point is that the personal confrontation between Mr. Foster and the witness violated the privilege against self-incrimination.","start":85.858,"stop":98.209,"duration":12.35},{"text":"This first issue was based on the holding in Stovall versus Denno which was decided last year by this Court with the other lineup decisions of United States versus Wade and Gilbert versus California.","start":98.209,"stop":112.573,"duration":14.36},{"text":"I might point out that Foster's trial and the decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeal, the original trial result in a conviction of Mr. Foster and the Fifth District Court of Appeal in California affirmed occurred prior to the decisions in Stovall, Wade and Gilbert.","start":112.573,"stop":130.074,"duration":17.5},{"text":"To properly pursue the question to due process which is our principal contention, I wish to review the facts of the case with particular emphasis on the events and circumstances surrounding the lineups.","start":130.074,"stop":144.447,"duration":14.37},{"text":"The crime charge was armed robbery of a Western Union Office in Fresno in January 1966.","start":144.447,"stop":152.413,"duration":7.97},{"text":"The victim was the late night manager.","start":152.413,"stop":155.577,"duration":3.16},{"text":"He was the only witness to the robbery, a man by the name of Joseph David.","start":155.577,"stop":160.5,"duration":4.92},{"text":"He testified that two men entered the office shortly after midnight on January 25, 1966 and after appearing to make out a MoneyGram, approached him at the counter with guns pointed at him and handed him a holdup note.","start":160.5,"stop":180.276,"duration":19.78},{"text":"He described these two men as one tall individual dressed in coveralls with a hat pulled down over his face and visible under the coveralls a black leather jacket.","start":180.276,"stop":196.926,"duration":16.65},{"text":"The shorter of the man was dressed as he described in casual clothes and a suit coat.","start":196.926,"stop":203.333,"duration":6.41},{"text":"The man after handing the holdup note to him required him to open the safe and a money box to hand the money to the taller of the men at which time the taller men left the office.","start":203.333,"stop":216.399,"duration":13.07},{"text":"The shorter man stayed three or four minutes later making certain threatening gestures to the witness.","start":216.399,"stop":223.361,"duration":6.96},{"text":"Without relating in greater detail the facts of the crime, I wish to point out the significance of certain items.","start":223.361,"stop":233.277,"duration":9.92},{"text":"First of all that the short time that the tall individual as indicated in the record was in the office, this man was ultimately described or stated by the witness to be Walter Foster, he was there three minutes at the outside perhaps six minutes.","start":233.277,"stop":249.594,"duration":16.32},{"text":"Part of that time, the witness was facing a gun held by this tall robber.","start":249.594,"stop":254.283,"duration":4.69},{"text":"The second is the contradiction in the description of the dress of the witness of the shorter man.","start":254.283,"stop":260.779,"duration":6.5},{"text":"The shorter individual ultimately testified at time of trial.","start":260.779,"stop":265.685,"duration":4.91},{"text":"And third was the fact that the witness changed the description of the coloring of the individual -- the tall individual at the time of trial because as he indicated the background of the office was such that he had to make this change at time of trial.","start":265.685,"stop":283.889,"duration":18.2},{"text":"All these points go to the one fact that the witness had little chance for observation of the individuals that robbed the office that evening.","start":283.889,"stop":295.746,"duration":11.86},{"text":"And as pointed out in the Wade decision, Mr. David was a likely suspect for prompting or for the effects of an improper lineup.","start":295.746,"stop":309.714,"duration":13.97},{"text":"I mentioned that the witness ultimately described or stated that the tall individual was Walter Foster.","start":309.714,"stop":316.493,"duration":6.78},{"text":"This was only after the two lineups and a personal confrontation to briefly complete the background of the case J. V. Clay, testified for the prosecution at the time of trial.","start":316.493,"stop":331.14,"duration":14.65},{"text":"He indicated that he was the shorter man that robbed the Western Union office that night.","start":331.14,"stop":335.935,"duration":4.8},{"text":"He admitted full participation however, gave certain statements in the basis of his testimony was that he was ordered to do these things by Walter Foster for a $50.00 sum.","start":335.935,"stop":348.244,"duration":12.31},{"text":"He fully implicated Foster and a John Henry Grice as a third party.","start":348.244,"stop":355.21,"duration":6.97},{"text":"Now the significance of Clay's testimony, I believe, is that number one, he contradicted Mr. David in so far as the clothing that he wore himself that night which again I think goes to the point that the lack of chance for observation.","start":355.21,"stop":369.61,"duration":14.4},{"text":"The second point is that he gave a statement one day after the robbery to the police implicating Foster and Grice in this robbery.","start":369.61,"stop":378.867,"duration":9.26},{"text":"Now, I wish to point out to the Court California Penal Code Section 1111 which appears and I think appendix B of the respondent's brief requires cooperation of an accomplice's testimony.","start":378.867,"stop":393.016,"duration":14.15},{"text":"Now the situation has placed the police in at the time they receive the statement from Mr. Clay was that they had one man, one participant in the robbery.","start":393.016,"stop":406.233,"duration":13.22},{"text":"They knew who the second one was or they felt they knew who the second one was and as we point out in the brief, Mr. Foster was perhaps a likely man for the police, he had a previous record.","start":406.233,"stop":418.657,"duration":12.42},{"text":"The problem that they had was to have Mr. David identify.","start":418.657,"stop":422.278,"duration":3.62},{"text":"Mr. David, the lone witnesses identified Mr. Foster as not unlike the situation outlined in Palmer versus Payton which is referred to by the Court in Stovall versus Denno where they talked about the understandable zeal of the police.","start":422.278,"stop":439.511,"duration":17.23},{"text":"They believe that Foster was their man.","start":439.511,"stop":442.492,"duration":2.98},{"text":"The question was whether the witness would identify him.","start":442.492,"stop":446.803,"duration":4.31},{"text":"Turning to the lineups, two or three days after the robbery the witness was called to the police station to view a lineup, there were three men present.","start":446.803,"stop":458.571,"duration":11.77},{"text":"The witness had testified that the one man was a taller man, approximately six foot tall who was in the lineup, hatless and was wearing a black leather jacket similar to what he said he saw under the coveralls of one of the individuals who robbed him.","start":458.571,"stop":475.88,"duration":17.31},{"text":"The other two men were shorter men five foot five, five foot six, they were both required to wear hats, they both -- and one had a mustache.","start":475.88,"stop":486.403,"duration":10.52},{"text":"Evaluating this first lineup in terms of the considerations outlined in Wade, we would have to say that Foster, number one was the lone tall suspect, he was the only one wearing clothes similar to that which was allegedly worn by one of the men that robbed the Western Union office.","start":486.403,"stop":508.003,"duration":21.6},{"text":"Both of these factors are things that were outlined in Wade, are part of the problems of lineups, problems of the police making suggestive factors available to the witness at the time of the lineup.","start":508.003,"stop":527.788,"duration":19.79},{"text":"Now assuming that the witness gave a description of the men who robbed into the police indicating the dress that they wore, this first lineup, the composition of it clearly made Foster's stand out, yet Mr. David did not make any identification at that time.","start":527.788,"stop":546.83,"duration":19.04},{"text":"Shortly, after the lineup or at the time of the lineup he requested to speak to the individual later identified as Mr. Foster, this was the personal confrontation I spoke of.","start":546.83,"stop":560.455,"duration":13.63},{"text":"Foster, the witness, the policeman and the Deputy District Attorney went to a private room where a conversation was held between Foster and David.","start":560.455,"stop":572.373,"duration":11.92},{"text":"I'll point out that no part of the conversation was introduced into evidence merely the fact that a conversation did take place.","start":572.373,"stop":579.691,"duration":7.32},{"text":"Now we analogize this to the widely condemned practice of the single suspect confrontation.","start":579.691,"stop":586.826,"duration":7.13},{"text":"Palmer versus Payton and Justice Douglas in his dissent in Biggers versus Tennessee last term, elaborated on the evils of the single suspect confrontation.","start":586.826,"stop":597.052,"duration":10.23},{"text":"It's clear that the witness has no alternative but this one individual that he's looking at.","start":597.052,"stop":603.026,"duration":5.97},{"text":"The police in effect are saying this is the man.","start":603.026,"stop":606.724,"duration":3.7},{"text":"The second aspect related to our particular case is that this was a special procedure or an isolation of Foster versus the other two men in the lineup.","start":606.724,"stop":618.114,"duration":11.39},{"text":"They handled him differently, it's very hard to imagine a more suggestive situation and for the police to take one man to isolate him and to treat him differently in so far as the witnesses are concerned.","start":618.114,"stop":632.675,"duration":14.56},{"text":"They could do nothing more if they turned around and said this is the man we believe is guilty of the crime.","start":632.675,"stop":639.569,"duration":6.89},{"text":"Now, no further Court the case of Crum versus Beddow (ph) 383 F.2d which is outlined -- I think is listed in both the briefs which presented a similar situation in so far as isolating an individual from a lineup at the request of a one of the witnesses.","start":639.569,"stop":658.458,"duration":18.89},{"text":"Now, the court there looked at the situation and stated that this is very well a situation that violates due process to do this, to pull the men out, to suggest to the man -- the witnesses that this is the man.","start":658.458,"stop":673.576,"duration":15.12},{"text":"The distinguishing feature in the Crum (ph) case was the fact that there the witness said, “I'm sure this is the man.”","start":673.576,"stop":682.75,"duration":9.17},{"text":"The court pointed out that if this had not -- if the positive identification had not been made by the witness that this very well would have been a violation of due process.","start":682.75,"stop":692.781,"duration":10.03},{"text":"After this personal confrontation, the witness David still made no identification of Foster.","start":692.781,"stop":700.042,"duration":7.26},{"text":"Ten days later the police presented the crowning blow, they called Mr. David back to a second lineup.","start":700.042,"stop":710.603,"duration":10.56},{"text":"There were five men present.","start":710.603,"stop":712.762,"duration":2.16},{"text":"They were all dressed similarly in jail (Inaudible).","start":712.762,"stop":717.135,"duration":4.37},{"text":"Yet, the only man that was present in the second lineup who had been seen by David and present in the first lineup was Walter Foster.","start":717.135,"stop":726.157,"duration":9.02},{"text":"We ask the question of what more could the police do?","start":726.157,"stop":730.023,"duration":3.87},{"text":"To suggest and to implicate Foster as the individual that they were asking David to identify, the respondents indicate this is a situation where we just had a super cautious witness.","start":730.023,"stop":747.045,"duration":17.02},{"text":"I think the record clearly shows it's a situation where the witness could not identify the individual who was there until forced upon him by suggestion.","start":747.045,"stop":758.891,"duration":11.85},{"text":"Now, if it please the Court we contend that each step taken by the police in the prosecution can be criticized as suggestive and unfair and pointed to Foster but more important is the cumulative effect of each of these three steps.","start":758.891,"stop":777.265,"duration":18.37},{"text":"They made adversely impossible for the witness to make any identification other than that of Foster.","start":777.265,"stop":785.745,"duration":8.48},{"text":"I think that one other aspect of this is that question of the necessity or as pointed out in Stovall versus Denno by Justice Brennan that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the lineup.","start":785.745,"stop":800.588,"duration":14.84},{"text":"The respondents, it seemed to tie this in this question of totality of the circumstances with the harmless error rule and ask the Court in our brief to review all the facts of the case before deciding the due process issue.","start":800.588,"stop":815.367,"duration":14.78},{"text":"We dispute this.","start":815.367,"stop":816.531,"duration":1.16},{"text":"We interpret this reference to the totality of the circumstances to mean the events and circumstances surrounding the lineup alone.","start":816.531,"stop":824.726,"duration":8.2},{"text":"What prompted the action of the police to bring about the lineup in the manner in which they did in Stovall versus Denno there was a dying witness that brought about the single suspect confrontation.","start":824.726,"stop":839.1,"duration":14.37},{"text":"That single suspect confrontation was criticized but it was said that under all the circumstances the case that this was not a denial of due process.","start":839.1,"stop":848.091,"duration":8.99},{"text":"In the Unites States versus Simmons which was decided last term there were the suspects where at large and it was indicated that there was a need for identification immediately with use of photographs, again, the totality of the circumstances.","start":848.091,"stop":861.529,"duration":13.44},{"text":"People versus Ford and State versus Sears which are cited in respondent's briefs where situations of on the spot apprehensions of individual suspected a crime and on the spot identifications which again are situations I believe that are involved the totality of the circumstances surrounding the lineup alone.","start":861.529,"stop":883.053,"duration":21.52},{"text":"Necessary procedures which prevented a traditional lineup but when considers a whole -- when the lineups are considered as a whole they were not a violation of due process.","start":883.053,"stop":894.367,"duration":11.31},{"text":"I believe that in our case we have none of those circumstances, there are no imperative circumstances.","start":894.367,"stop":901.081,"duration":6.71},{"text":"Foster was under arrest.","start":901.081,"stop":903.093,"duration":2.01},{"text":"There was no necessity to proceed or to deviate from established procedures.","start":903.093,"stop":911.517,"duration":8.42},{"text":"No excuse.","start":911.517,"stop":912.85,"duration":1.33}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"There was no question
