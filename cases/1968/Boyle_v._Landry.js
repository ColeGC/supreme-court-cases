1968.","start":60.734,"stop":64.825,"duration":4.09},{"text":"The posture of this case in the lower court is as follows: A complaint was filed by the plaintiffs purported alleging a conspiracy to

that the plaintiff's' constitutional rights were violated.","start":64.825,"stop":89.289,"duration":24.46},{"text":"The defendants' filed a motion to dismiss initially alleging four basic

defendants.","start":126.231,"stop":131.087,"duration":4.86},{"text":"In doing so, he stated that the plaintiffs did have proper standing that the question of 2283 was a premature question because that statute was not jurisdictional that a three-judge court would be convened and the first order of business upon convening the three-judge court would be to determine the threshold question of constitutionality with respect to the five enumerated statutes which the plaintiffs have challenged.","start":131.087,"stop":157.652,"duration":26.57},{"text":"The appellants thereby filed an answer,

offense.","start":171.961,"stop":197.546,"duration":25.58},{"text":"The lower court held that the statute in question was overbroad because it prohibited insubstantial evil.","start":197.546,"stop":205.486,"duration":7.94},{"text":"They said that the commission of offenses against public order only is not such a substantial evil that the state may prohibit the threat of it and they further stated that the prohibition of insubstantial evil is outweighed by legitimate political discussion on a wide birth.","start":205.486,"stop":225.239,"duration":19.75},{"text":"There are two issues presented for review in this case.","start":225.239,"stop":228.396,"duration":3.16},{"text":"One, whether the plaintiffs have sufficient requisites standing to entitle them to determination of the constitutionality of the intimidation statute and two, if they do have such standing whether the First Amendment prohibition against the abridgement of speech is violated by a state statute which prohibits threats to commit a criminal offense where the intention is to force another to surrender his freedom of choice.","start":228.396,"stop":256.54,"duration":28.14},{"text":"Now, as to the standing point, the complaint shows the constitutional validity of five Illinois statutes: the map violating statute,

statute which prohibits threats to commit a criminal offense where the threats are intended to force another, to surrender their freedom of choice is not within the purview of the First Amendment.","start":500.457,"stop":516.678,"duration":16.22},{"text":"We contend this upon two factors.","start":516.678,"stop":519.203,"duration":2.52},{"text":"First, in analysis of the thrust of the statute; and secondly the scope of the First Amendment with respect to threaten conduct where the intention is to force another to surrender their freedom of choice.","start":519.203,"stop":532.122,"duration":12.92},{"text":"The lower court in this case in a very fine opinion found that the intimidation statute as a whole was designed to protect communications intended to compel another to act against his will.","start":532.122,"stop":545.622,"duration":13.5},{"text":"The Court defined a threat then and they said a threat was an expression of an intention to inflict harm or evil against another.","start":545.622,"stop":553.339,"duration":7.72},{"text":"They said that it was more than a mere intention however that it was a menace that it must unsettle the mind of the person on whom it operates and then it must take away from his acts that free and voluntary choice which would alone constitute consent.","start":553.339,"stop":567.881,"duration":14.54},{"text":"They set further that the expression of that threat must have a reasonable tendency to be carried out by the threatener according to its tenor.","start":567.881,"stop":578.361,"duration":10.48},{"text":"This is the definition of threat, this is a definition we abide by now yet when the lower court approach to sub-section involved it shifted its emphasis from the substantiality of the threat to the substantiality of the crime.","start":578.361,"stop":594.629,"duration":16.27},{"text":"This, we feel is what precipitated the error in the lower court's decision.","start":594.629,"stop":599.801,"duration":5.17},{"text":"The lower court itself stated earlier that the substantiality of the crime was not really the important thing because they said that a mere expression of intent to commit a criminal act was not itself sufficient under the statute that we need the final element of extortion which completes the prohibited act, which is the taking away of that free and voluntary action which alone constitutes consent.","start":599.801,"stop":624.931,"duration":25.13},{"text":"So the substantiality of the evil must go to the threat and to the fear committed by that threat as far as the object of the threat is concerned, the victim, and not to the substantiality or the insubstantiality of the crime threat.","start":624.931,"stop":640.785,"duration":15.85},{"text":"The Court made three illustrations to justify proposed -- their proposed opinion and the three illustrations were the following: a group of dissidents who asked for certain things or will commit disorderly conduct, people in a high crime neighborhood who asked for more police protection are failing to get a threat and to carry conceal weapons, and finally, group of mothers who threatened to block a highway should they not get a traffic regulatory signal.","start":640.785,"stop":675.63,"duration":34.85},{"text":"And the lower court was of the opinion that since those crimes that they threaten was so insubstantial when measured against legitimate political discussion on a wide birth that the First Amendment should then protect those statements.","start":675.63,"stop":693.406,"duration":17.78},{"text":"In those examples, the Court in looking to the crime threat failed to observe the main purpose in spirit of the statute toward the person threatened.","start":693.406,"stop":707.762,"duration":14.36},{"text":"The substantiality of the threat could be great and the substantiality of the crime need not be great, need be insignificant and can be insignificant.","start":707.762,"stop":720.171,"duration":12.41},{"text":"One example of this would be a threat by an individual to burn two pieces of lumber placed together in the form of a cross in an open field next to a school which is to be integrated the next day.","start":720.171,"stop":735.391,"duration":15.22},{"text":"A situation involving a substantial threat, but yet of an insubstantial crime.","start":735.391,"stop":742.851,"duration":7.46},{"text":"A further example individuals on a campus who approach the chancellor and tell the chancellor that unless their demands are met within five days, that they are going to disrupt classes, that they are going to take over his office, they're not going to threaten him personally or physically, they're not going to destroy the building but they're just going to make it impossible for the school to function.","start":742.851,"stop":767.315,"duration":24.46},{"text":"This would be a situation where the threat would be very substantial but yet the crime might be nothing more than disorderly conduct.","start":767.315,"stop":776.619,"duration":9.3},{"text":"It is appellant's contention that this type of examples along with the example cited by the lower court which fall within the purview in concept to this statute and that the statute is valid.","start":776.619,"stop":789.022,"duration":12.4},{"text":"In essence then with the lower court seems to be saying is that the threat of an insignificant crime when they said that the threat of an insignificant crime should not be punished, they are really saying that a little bit of illegality is not so bad and can be protected by the First Amendment so long as speech is involved.","start":789.022,"stop":808.333,"duration":19.31},{"text":"In examining this issue in the light of First Amendment protections, it doesn't seem to meet the category of the First Amendment preserves.","start":808.333,"stop":819.736,"duration":11.4},{"text":"An extortion by threat is not the advocacy of ideas, it's not the teaching of ideas and it's not the exposition of ideas.","start":819.736,"stop":827.454,"duration":7.72},{"text":"It's not legitimate political discussion on a wide birth.","start":827.454,"stop":834.16,"duration":6.71},{"text":"The entire history of the cases of this Court from Baldwin versus Robertson in 1896, to the statement made in Carroll versus President and Board of Commissioners of Saint Anne's County late last year seem to indicate that speech uttered in a context of violence or speech uttered to follow an illegal course of conduct are not prohibited -- are prohibited rather by the First Amendment.","start":834.16,"stop":859.784,"duration":25.62},{"text":"The First Amendment should not protect that type of conduct.","start":859.784,"stop":863.888,"duration":4.1},{"text":"And on our brief on page 18 and 19, we have set forth a myriad of cases respecting this point.","start":863.888,"stop":872.698,"duration":8.81},{"text":"I should just like to mention a few.","start":872.698,"stop":875.559,"duration":2.86},{"text":"In Bridges versus California where this Court a contempt case where this Court reversed the contempt conviction, this Court was very clear to point out that under no construction therefore and I'm quoting directly, “under no construction therefore, can we take the telegram of Bridges to be a threat to follow an illegal course of conduct?”","start":875.559,"stop":895.164,"duration":19.61},{"text":"In Chaplinsky versus New Hampshire where this Court said fighting words are no essential part of any exposition of ideas.","start":895.164,"stop":903.235,"duration":8.07},{"text":"In American Communications versus Douds where the majority set the Government may cutoff a speaker only when his views are no longer merely views but threatened clearly and imminently to ripen into conduct into which the public has a right to protect.","start":903.235,"stop":920.414,"duration":17.18},{"text":"And even Roth and Smith in the concurring and dissenting opinions, the dissenters or the individuals who concurred stated that freedom of expression can be suppressed if and to the extent, it is so closely brigaded with illegal action as to be an inseparable part of it.","start":920.414,"stop":940.695,"duration":20.28},{"text":"Your Honors, the approval of a little bit of illegality constitutes the doctrine of permissive lawlessness which this Court has never sanctioned and which I hope it never will.","start":940.695,"stop":954.051,"duration":13.36},{"text":"How can we allow individuals or pressure groups to exact gain from others based upon the threat to commit a criminal offense and at the same time maintain that we lived under a system of order, under a system where First Amendment rights are protected under a system or individual rights are first and foremost?","start":954.051,"stop":976.149,"duration":22.1},{"text":"I don't think we could live with the opinion of the lower court in so state.","start":976.149,"stop":983.15,"duration":7},{"text":"In conclusion, the effect of the decision of the lower court is to insulate via the First Amendment threatened acts which force other individuals to surrender their freedom of choice.","start":983.15,"stop":995.05,"duration":11.9},{"text":"The statute under consideration when measured by the scope of the decisions of this Court failed to transgress upon the sanctity of free expression of ideas, since the protection of the right of another as freedom of choice stands upon as equal footing as the right of the speaker to say it.","start":995.05,"stop":1015.826,"duration":20.78}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Could I ask you a question going back to your standing
