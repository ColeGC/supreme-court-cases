first degree murder was reversed by the Delaware Supreme Court for a trial de novo.","start":15.135,"stop":24.618,"duration":9.48},{"text":"He was tried again after this Court's decision in Miranda and convicted of second degree murder.","start":24.618,"stop":32.283,"duration":7.67},{"text":"The Delaware Supreme Court subsequently entered a judgment affirming that conviction, and this Court granted certiorari to review that judgment.","start":32.283,"stop":41.421,"duration":9.14},{"text":"Two issues are raised in this proceeding.","start":41.421,"stop":44.6,"duration":3.18},{"text":"First, are the standards of Miranda applicable to all trials including retrials commenced after the decision was announced?","start":44.6,"stop":54.024,"duration":9.42},{"text":"Secondly, does the warrantless search of a suspects home based solely upon the consent of his co-occupant, violate the suspect's rights under the Fourth Amendment where he was physically present and immediately to give or withhold his consent, and where the purpose of the search was to obtain evidence not against his co-occupant, but against he suspect himself?","start":54.024,"stop":83.487,"duration":29.46},{"text":"The facts are not in dispute.","start":83.487,"stop":85.149,"duration":1.66},{"text":"Indeed, the statement of the

these.","start":92.245,"stop":95.432,"duration":3.19},{"text":"On the morning of March 17, 1965, officers of the Wilmington, Delaware Police Department were called to investigate in apparent homicide.","start":95.432,"stop":105.652,"duration":10.22},{"text":"The victim was found in a junkyard.","start":105.652,"stop":108.275,"duration":2.62},{"text":"Subsequent examination of the body by an assistant medical examiner disclosed that the victim had died sometime the prior evening.","start":108.275,"stop":117.773,"duration":9.5},{"text":"The petitioner and a companion had been observed on the street in the vicinity of that junkyard on that prior evening.","start":117.773,"stop":126.129,"duration":8.36},{"text":"They had been apprehended and taken to the police station where they were questioned by a Sergeant Maloney and subsequently released.","start":126.129,"stop":134.533,"duration":8.4},{"text":"Sergeant Maloney's name will come again.","start":134.533,"stop":137.415,"duration":2.88},{"text":"Between 9 and 10 o'clock on the morning of the March the 17th, that is the day after the initial apprehension.","start":137.415,"stop":144.768,"duration":7.35},{"text":"Sergeant Maloney went with four other officers to the home of the petitioner.","start":144.768,"stop":149.629,"duration":4.86},{"text":"His purpose was to see if the petitioner and his companion of the prior evening were there.","start":149.629,"stop":155.095,"duration":5.47},{"text":"The petitioner's lady friend, Ms. Marshall, answered the door and Sergeant Maloney indeed asked if Thornton Jenkins, the petitioner was present.","start":155.095,"stop":164.47,"duration":9.38},{"text":"The petitioner and his companion, his lady friend and three other persons, being all of those present in the house were apprehended at that time and taken to the detective division of the police station.","start":164.47,"stop":177.518,"duration":13.05},{"text":"A bit of geography might be of assistance here.","start":177.518,"stop":180.809,"duration":3.29},{"text":"It seems that all of the county and municipal functions in the New Castle, Delaware are taking care of in a single building called the Public Building, which has at one end the city functions and at the other end, its county functions.","start":180.809,"stop":196.261,"duration":15.45},{"text":"The police station is located in the city end of that Public Building.","start":196.261,"stop":201.595,"duration":5.33},{"text":"At the police station, the petitioner was placed in a so called recording room located in the detective division.","start":201.595,"stop":208.994,"duration":7.4},{"text":"At 11 o'clock that morning, he was charged with night prowling.","start":208.994,"stop":213.711,"duration":4.72},{"text":"At 11:40 that morning, Sergeant Maloney, according to his testimony, advised the petitioner's lady friend of and his words “her rights” and requested permission to search the house.","start":213.711,"stop":226.176,"duration":12.46},{"text":"She told him that he could search the house, which he then did, discovering of junk and clothing which were seized and later introduced into evidence at the trial.","start":226.176,"stop":236.151,"duration":9.98},{"text":"I'll return when we come to the subject of the validity of this search to some more specific facts on that issue.","start":236.151,"stop":245.229,"duration":9.08},{"text":"Now, later that same afternoon at 1:15 P.M., the petitioner was formally charged with fourth degree burglary and murder in the first degree.","start":245.229,"stop":254.159,"duration":8.93},{"text":"Subsequently at 7 P.M., an incriminating written statement was obtained from him.","start":254.159,"stop":259.902,"duration":5.74},{"text":"The purpose of this confession was of course to verify what the police officers had already concluded, namely that the petitioner was that person, or at least one of them who had committed the homicide then under investigation.","start":259.902,"stop":273.39,"duration":13.49},{"text":"Although, the evidence is conflicting upon what warnings were given to the petitioner and when they were given regarding his Fifth Amendment rights.","start":273.39,"stop":282.221,"duration":8.83},{"text":"For the petitioner for example, insist that he was not given any warnings until after he had signed the statement.","start":282.221,"stop":287.79,"duration":5.57},{"text":"It is clear that he was not advised of his right to have counsel supplied to him in the event he wished and was enable to afford counsel.","start":287.79,"stop":296.734,"duration":8.94},{"text":"Timely motions to suppress both the products of the search and the statement were filed both before and during the trials and were denied.","start":296.734,"stop":306.022,"duration":9.29},{"text":"Petitioner's first trial began in January of 1966, and his more recent trial in October of '67.","start":306.022,"stop":315.704,"duration":9.68},{"text":"It was the petitioner's second trial in October of '67 which poses the first issue raised here.","start":315.704,"stop":323.642,"duration":7.94},{"text":"Following his initial conviction, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed for several reasons, none of them relating to the petitioner's statement, and in so doing directed that although the new trial was to be de novo, the standards proscribed by Miranda were not to be applied.","start":323.642,"stop":340.149,"duration":16.51},{"text":"Johnson held that Miranda would apply only to trials begun after that decision, namely Miranda, was announced.","start":340.149,"stop":346.995,"duration":6.85},{"text":"It was not specifically concerned with and did not expressly hold whether a retrial was among the trials in which Miranda was to be applicable.","start":346.995,"stop":357.924,"duration":10.93},{"text":"For four major reasons, we submit that the admissibility of a criminal defendant's incriminating statement at a retrial should be measured by the same gauge as any other defendant going to trial at the same time, very briefly, those reasons are these.","start":357.924,"stop":375.431,"duration":17.51},{"text":"First, the purpose of the Miranda Rule is to enhance the reliability of the fact finding process at trial.","start":375.431,"stop":383.01,"duration":7.58},{"text":"Now, that purpose could not be fully implemented if it were applicable only to some trials.","start":383.01,"stop":390.1,"duration":7.09},{"text":"Now here, we think that the contrasting treatment in Stovall of the way Gilbert rules is enlightening.","start":390.1,"stop":397.566,"duration":7.47},{"text":"There of course, the critical time was fixed as the time of the confrontation.","start":397.566,"stop":402.101,"duration":4.54},{"text":"The time when the identification took place.","start":402.101,"stop":407.247,"duration":5.15},{"text":"Here, the time was fixed at trial.","start":407.247,"stop":411.055,"duration":3.81},{"text":"Similarly, in this Court's recent decision in Fuller versus Alaska announcing the applicability of the Lee versus Florida rule, once again, the time was fixed.","start":411.055,"stop":422.811,"duration":11.76},{"text":"Not the time that the officers obtained the evidence in violation of Section 605 of the Federal Communication Act, but at the time of trial and once again however, no distinction being made as to the types of trial.","start":422.811,"stop":438.968,"duration":16.16},{"text":"But certainly would seem that if the rule in Lee versus Florida, which -- in which -- as to which the Court said that it doesn't go to the enhancement of the fact finding process.","start":438.968,"stop":449.974,"duration":11.01},{"text":"The trial is going to be applicable at trials subsequent to the time that decision was announced.","start":449.974,"stop":456.848,"duration":6.87},{"text":"It would seem anomalous to not apply at least in the retrial context, a rule which does to the core of the fact finding process.","start":456.848,"stop":466.098,"duration":9.25},{"text":"Second, our second reason is this, in fixing the extent to which there maybe full effectuation of the individual's Fifth Amendment rights at trial, the results of his prior in-custody interrogation may and frequently are determinative.","start":466.098,"stop":482.228,"duration":16.13},{"text":"It is difficult if not impossible to distinguish between the exercise of those rights during an in-custody interrogation and during trial, to the extent they have been lost in the interrogation process they can not be fully exercised at trial.","start":482.228,"stop":498.378,"duration":16.15},{"text":"The choice of whether or not to testify may then not be as a practical matter, one which is open to the defendant.","start":498.378,"stop":506.483,"duration":8.11},{"text":"Third reason is this, there is a seeming impairment of judicial integrity in sanctioning the simultaneous trials of different persons in adjoining courts but by different standards and perhaps, it is reading too much into Johnson, but it appears to have as one of its purposes the implementation of the Miranda's protections as soon as possible, but at the same time minimizing any disruptive effects which would be caused by its application.","start":506.483,"stop":534.558,"duration":28.07},{"text":"That there would be some disruption is apparent, because Johnson would not exclude or would exclude from evidence that those confessions which were obtained either prior to the announcement of Miranda, or indeed after, ff they were in compliance with Miranda standards provided that no trial of any kind had been commenced by that date.","start":534.558,"stop":559.812,"duration":25.25},{"text":"And fourth, there is an obvious point and perhaps too obvious that where Johnson uses the words trials, that's exactly what was meant, and no exclusion of all trials, except a defendant's first appearance at the bar was intended.","start":559.812,"stop":575.393,"duration":15.58},{"text":"Most of the decision which are cited in all of the briefs, including that of the amicus Attorney General State of New York, on that or supporting the decision or in accord with the decision of the Delaware Supreme Court in this case, pick the critical word as cases.","start":575.393,"stop":594.124,"duration":18.73},{"text":"And what they have done with this word is sometimes very interesting.","start":594.124,"stop":597.694,"duration":3.57},{"text":"For example, in the case of Boone versus State, I take that in that correction, State versus Branch, a North Carolina decision and the Court there found that the word case was determinative and how that a case begins at the time of the in-custody interrogation.","start":597.694,"stop":615.022,"duration":17.33},{"text":"And I suggest that that gives substantial warping to the Johnson decision.","start":615.022,"stop":622.873,"duration":7.85},{"text":"I'd like to make one or two brief comments upon the brief of the amicus curiae.","start":622.873,"stop":628.028,"duration":5.15},{"text":"First he urged that -- the amicus urges that the New York courts have relied upon the non-applicability of Miranda in reversing subsequent cases.","start":628.028,"stop":637.88,"duration":9.85},{"text":"We would suggest that the cases were reversed because they had either been wrongly decided or for some other error committed during the course at trial.","start":637.88,"stop":645.494,"duration":7.61},{"text":"Secondly, it's argued that Miranda should not, and I'm quoting, “be applied to past convictions merely because a retrial is ordered.”","start":645.494,"stop":653.645,"duration":8.15},{"text":"I would suggest that if a retrial is ordered, there is no past conviction but only a future trial.","start":653.645,"stop":660.44,"duration":6.8},{"text":"Finally, the amicus contends that the primary aim of Miranda was to change the circumstances of interrogation.","start":660.44,"stop":666.685,"duration":6.24},{"text":"I would suggest that that simply is not what -- that is one of the purposes, but is not the primary purpose.","start":666.685,"stop":673.679,"duration":6.99},{"text":"We turn now to the search and seizure question.","start":673.679,"stop":676.434,"duration":2.75},{"text":"And there, I think some additional facts maybe of assistance.","start":676.434,"stop":680.908,"duration":4.47},{"text":"The petitioner and his lady friend, Leona Marshall, had lived together as man and wife for about three or four years prior to his arrest.","start":680.908,"stop":689.177,"duration":8.27},{"text":"They had lived in the house where the petitioner was apprehended for a period of anywhere from, according to here testimony, two of those years to perhaps nine months according to the landlord.","start":689.177,"stop":701.193,"duration":12.02},{"text":"Between 9 and 10 o'clock on the morning of March 17, some five officers of the Wilmington Police Department went to the petitioner's home to apprehend the petitioner and his companion of the prior evening.","start":701.193,"stop":713.924,"duration":12.73},{"text":"Sergeant Maloney knocked on the front door, Ms. Marshall still dressed in a house coat, answered the door.","start":713.924,"stop":720.916,"duration":6.99},{"text":"Sergeant Maloney asked for the petitioner.","start":720.916,"stop":723.132,"duration":2.22},{"text":"The people in the house were then collected in one of the rooms, which I think Sergeant Maloney described as a dining room, where Ms. Marshall observed the petitioner's companion being directed to lean against the wall and being patted down.","start":723.132,"stop":736.952,"duration":13.82},{"text":"She was told to get some clothes on and testified if she was advised that the people in the house were going downtown.","start":736.952,"stop":743.3,"duration":6.35},{"text":"They were taken in to police station.","start":743.3,"stop":745.504,"duration":2.2},{"text":"All of those apprehended, except for the petitioners and his companion, were seated on a bench immediately outside the detective division portion of the police station.","start":745.504,"stop":755.791,"duration":10.29},{"text":"The petitioner was taken inside and placed in a so called recording room, which is a separate room within the larger confine of the detective division.","start":755.791,"stop":765.193,"duration":9.4},{"text":"Sergeant Maloney thereafter sought Ms. Marshall's permission to search the house.","start":765.193,"stop":769.313,"duration":4.12},{"text":"The record is clear that at that time, Sergeant Maloney had Ms. Marshall in custody.","start":769.313,"stop":775.229,"duration":5.92},{"text":"He knew that the petitioner lived at the house to be search.","start":775.229,"stop":778.523,"duration":3.29},{"text":"He knew that the petitioner was one of the two prime suspects in the homicide investigation then being conducted.","start":778.523,"stop":784.978,"duration":6.45},{"text":"He knew that the petitioner was present in the recording room.","start":784.978,"stop":788.212,"duration":3.23},{"text":"He proposed to conduct the search to obtain evidence of the petitioner's guilt to the homicide, and he made no effort whatsoever to obtain the petitioner's consent to the search.","start":788.212,"stop":798.978,"duration":10.77},{"text":"For her part, Ms. Marshall had a limited comprehension of what the search was all about and what her rights were.","start":798.978,"stop":805.064,"duration":6.09},{"text":"Basically, she testified that she just didn't know what it was all about because the police didn't tell her.","start":805.064,"stop":810.873,"duration":5.81},{"text":"She didn't know that she was not required to permit a search.","start":810.873,"stop":814.152,"duration":3.28},{"text":"She thought the police could the property simply because they wanted to, and I think it's -- I should say to that she assumed that they could just get a search warrant by some process that she didn't understand, but that they could get one.","start":814.152,"stop":831.162,"duration":17.01},{"text":"But any event, as a result, she did permit the search for no reason really other than the police asked here to.","start":831.162,"stop":838.94,"duration":7.78},{"text":"The search therefore was without a warrant and was not conducted incident to a lawful arrest.","start":838.94,"stop":843.898,"duration":4.96},{"text":"The sole basis for its legitimacy was the acquiescence of Ms. Marshall, petitioner's co-occupant in the request of the police for
