case which we think supports our position here but the problem which it presented was that capital losses are subject to superior restriction as to their deductibility and they might have included the amount in the earlier year in income be entitled to deduct it as a capital loss in the later year but get very little benefit from it, and it was for that reason that 1341 (a) (5) was enacted to say that if they got little benefit from it in the later year, they could reduce their tax for the later year by the amount of tax which they paid in the earlier year.","start":1014.122,"stop":1057.2,"duration":43.08},{"text":"You also get similar situations where there are changes in the tax rates.","start":1057.2,"stop":1063.148,"duration":5.95},{"text":"In
