Bedford in which this Court specifically denied to itself the power to review questions of fact which had been passed upon and approved by the Trial Courts.","start":182.859,"stop":215.796,"duration":32.94},{"text":"And that was the law until 1879 when the specific question here involved was first raised in Railroad against Fraloff when this Court in an opinion by Justice Harlan specifically held that it had no power to review the excessiveness of a verdict found to be proper by the District Court.","start":215.796,"stop":252.759,"duration":36.96},{"text":"When the circuit courts, now the Courts of Appeals were created certainly they obtain no greater power of review than this Court when it itself was passing upon appeals from the District Courts.","start":252.759,"stop":271.643,"duration":18.88},{"text":"And the history of the circuits in the early days was early acceptance of this rule which had been promulgated by this Court that there was no power under the Seventh Amendment to interfere on the basis of the excessiveness of a verdict.","start":271.643,"stop":291.875,"duration":20.23},{"text":"That early acceptance gradually in the circuits one after another passed to arguments which constituted a rationalization of reasons why they should have some power of interference.","start":291.875,"stop":307.982,"duration":16.11},{"text":"And finally in the last 20 years specifically beginning about 1948 each of the Courts of Appeals has made the statement that it has the adherent power to interfere and overrule on the basis of excessiveness alone.","start":307.982,"stop":331.114,"duration":23.13},{"text":"Now, the Courts of Appeals have made three approaches to the statement of this power which they have that the Supreme Court did not have when it was hearing appeals itself.","start":331.114,"stop":346.143,"duration":15.03},{"text":"First, some of the Courts of Appeals have said that the common law history which was looked to by the Seventh Amendment does not support the position that the early judges of this Court took on these questions.","start":346.143,"stop":368.647,"duration":22.5},{"text":"That as a matter of fact when we look to the history of the common law procedure before 1791 when the amendment was adopted that the British Courts did in fact review in sort of an appellant procedure the qualm of a verdict as well as the weight of evidence.","start":368.647,"stop":394.692,"duration":26.05},{"text":"This I think is completely erroneous and has no basis whatsoever.","start":394.692,"stop":400.693,"duration":6},{"text":"It is based entirely on the fact that the English Court of Queen’s Bench decided en banc motions for a new trial which may have been tried before one of their judges at the assizes.","start":400.693,"stop":418.52,"duration":17.83},{"text":"But Justice Story in the Parsons against Bedford case realized that as well as did all of the early judges of this Court when he said that there could be no review of questions of fact except in the Court in which the case was tried or to which it was returned.","start":418.52,"stop":441.333,"duration":22.81},{"text":"Certainly, recognizing the fact that Queen’s Bench sat as a court en banc, and so any rationalization that the Court of Appeals today is like Westminster sitting in Queen’s Bench en banc because some of the history books tells us sometimes the trial judge did not sit in the court en banc certainly has no basis historically.","start":441.333,"stop":472.106,"duration":30.77},{"text":"The fact is and the writers have said and we have studied everyone of the cases which have been referred to by any of the Courts of Appeals there is no case reported prior to 1791 in the English books in which a new trial was granted except for error of law in which the trial judge did not sit at Westminster upon the hearing of the motion.","start":472.106,"stop":504.816,"duration":32.71},{"text":"Now, a second tact that has been taken and was taken by the Second Circuit in the early cases upon which our court relied was that true it is and this Court has held that a review of the quantum of the evidence may not ordinarily be made by an Appellant Court under the Seventh Amendment because this is the review of a question of fact and that this Court has said time and time again.","start":504.816,"stop":536.741,"duration":31.93},{"text":"But said the Second Circuit and others following it, there must be an upper limit that is a verdict maybe somewhat excessive we cannot interfere but it may reach an upper limit at which the question then becomes one of law and not one of fact.","start":536.741,"stop":560.946,"duration":24.21},{"text":"Then says the Court, we do not review that were verdict which the Seventh Amendment forbids us from going, we review the discretion of the trial judge in passing upon that verdict.","start":560.946,"stop":578.888,"duration":17.94},{"text":"No effort is made by any of the Courts of Appeals to explain how this question of fact, the excessiveness of a verdict is transmuted into a question of law by saying we are not reviewing the verdict we are reviewing the discretion of a trial judge and whether he has abused that discretion.","start":578.888,"stop":602.241,"duration":23.35},{"text":"And if that be true, that discretion may be reviewed and they be set aside because of abuse on what basis should it be made.","start":602.241,"stop":613.905,"duration":11.66},{"text":"This has never been explained by any of the Courts of Appeals except to say each case must be decided on its own facts.","start":613.905,"stop":623.425,"duration":9.52},{"text":"We will not review for mere excessiveness, but this particular case looks like one in which the trial judge was way out of line even though he saw the witnesses, he heard them, he heard all the evidence he was in a much better position that we, nevertheless, he was so far out of line that we say he abused his discretion and that then becomes a question of law, but with no explanation as to how this maybe transmuted into a question of law and come outside the purview of the Seventh Amendment.","start":623.425,"stop":662.551,"duration":39.13},{"text":"And the third rationalization has been that modern times require a reinterpretation of the Seventh Amendment and that this prohibition against the review of question of fact in modern times must be reexamined.","start":662.551,"stop":680.156,"duration":17.6},{"text":"And since this Court has gone so far as to say the changes in practice, changes in methods of an appeal, changes in pleadings need not be prohibited and we need not follow common law procedures.","start":680.156,"stop":696.102,"duration":15.95},{"text":"That therefore the Seventh Amendment may now be reinterpreted and we may now say that although ordinarily questions of facts may not be reviewed after the trial judge has approved them.","start":696.102,"stop":711.744,"duration":15.64},{"text":"That in this type of case where there is an excessiveness involved this is an exception and that this Court should now reinterpret the amendment to say that here we will permit it.","start":711.744,"stop":728.459,"duration":16.71},{"text":"This Court has never done.","start":728.459,"stop":731.777,"duration":3.32},{"text":"The Courts of Appeals have on various occasions look to some of the expressions that this Court has made in refusing to pass on this question since 1879; the latest one being in the Neese against Southern Railway in 1955 where the specific question was post on a precisely similar situation.","start":731.777,"stop":758.821,"duration":27.04},{"text":"And what this Court said there was, we will not reach at this time the constitutional question because reviewing the record we cannot say that this verdict was not without supporting the record, and therefore reversed the Fourth Circuit without going to the constitutional question and that may well be the position which this Court will decide to take in this case, because as we have pointed out, there is no justification in fact for the interference by the Seventh Circuit with this verdict.","start":758.821,"stop":800.678,"duration":41.86},{"text":"There is no justification in fact for the Second Circuit in a vote of two judges to one to decide that the trial judge who saw the witnesses and heard the evidence abused his discretion in permitting this verdict to stand.","start":800.678,"stop":819.332,"duration":18.65},{"text":"The Second Circuit majority did not even take the trouble to review in its opinion the evidence to determine whether in the language of this Court in the Neese case this verdict was without support in the record.","start":819.332,"stop":837.206,"duration":17.87},{"text":"It contended itself with saying that this verdict that appears to us is grossly excessive and it used another phrase which is difficult to rationalize it all.","start":837.206,"stop":850.229,"duration":13.02},{"text":"It said that we cannot find ourselves, and I'm paraphrasing I don’t have the precise words before me, able to reach a verdict greater than so much and therefore directed a remittitur.","start":850.229,"stop":868.041,"duration":17.81},{"text":"The verdict in this case was $305,000.00.","start":868.041,"stop":872.725,"duration":4.68},{"text":"Trial judge found it to be fully justified by the record and so did the dissenting judge on the Second Circuit.","start":872.725,"stop":880.573,"duration":7.85},{"text":"The two judges joined in the majority opinion said that they could not find themselves able to justify a verdict beyond $200,000.00 and directed a remittitur to the amount or else a new trial.","start":880.573,"stop":900.725,"duration":20.15},{"text":"Now, if Your Honors at this time as you did in Neese feel that this case does not present a question that must be decided that Fraloff and Parsons against Bedford may stand as they should until another case comes along.","start":900.725,"stop":926.477,"duration":25.75},{"text":"We are perfectly satisfied of course but if there is any right of review that this Court is willing to leave with the Courts of Appeals it cannot be on such a subjective basis as two judges feel that this is grossly excessive while the trial judge and the other judge on the Court of Appeals feels that it’s perfectly proper.","start":926.477,"stop":957.821,"duration":31.34},{"text":"There must be some objective treatment of this question and not this subjective approach to what is an excessive, what is grossly excessive, what is monstrous if this is to be the judgment upon which the Courts of Appeals are to base their decisions reviewing these questions.","start":957.821,"stop":980.227,"duration":22.41},{"text":"We have raised one other question in our brief which I think Your Honors will not require me to orally argue and that goes only to this second question that I have discussed.","start":980.227,"stop":995.022,"duration":14.8},{"text":"This was an action under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act and certainly as this Court has said time and time again the right of a jury trial and the right to have the jury verdict in violate as part and partial of that act, so that if in any case a verdict of a jury as to amount sustained by the trial judge should be sustained it is in a case under the Act.","start":995.022,"stop":1024.568,"duration":29.55},{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice I would like to reserve whatever I may

proper test.","start":1306.977,"stop":1330.351,"duration":23.37},{"text":"Now, the argument is advanced in support of petitioner’s contention is I submit essentially historical based upon the practice
