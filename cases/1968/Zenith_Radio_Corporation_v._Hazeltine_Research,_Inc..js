Zenith answered by setting up a patent and other patents of Hazeltine have been misused by putting them into foreign patent pools, which foreign patent pools had refused to license imports and had restricted commerce between United States and foreign countries, namely Canada, England, and Australia, contrary to the provisions of the antitrust law, the federal antitrust law that any restriction or any combination, conspiracy, or arrangement between competitors which restrain commerce not only between the states of the United States but between the comp -- the country of the United States and foreign countries, violated Section 4 of the Clayton Act, Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.","start":182.291,"stop":248.989,"duration":66.7},{"text":"And, under those two sections, also Section 16 of the Clayton Act, alleging the same facts as we'd set up in the misused answer we filed in counterclaim and, in that counterclaim, asked for travel damages and asked for an injunction against the activities of these foreign patent tools.","start":248.989,"stop":279.576,"duration":30.59},{"text":"After a trial and findings of fact in detail made by the District Court, a judgment was entered on April 5, 1965 pursuant to Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for damages which have been occasioned by the plaintiff or by the counterclaim in the amount of $19,042,173 for the loss of sales and profits in the Canadian market in the sale of home receiving sets in television and radio.","start":279.576,"stop":334.336,"duration":54.76},{"text":"At the time the findings came down, Hazeltine obtained new counsel and came in and made various motions which are discussed in the briefs, purport of which was to reopen the case on evidence which was available at the time of the trial and for further proceedings on the claim that there were embargoes imposed by the government as opposed to private patent pools and conspiracies in England and Australia.","start":334.336,"stop":380.558,"duration":46.22},{"text":"And, for that limited purpose, the case was reopened and after further hearing, on December 13, 1965, the Trial Court awarded

the first judgment, an injunction was added against the continuance by the respondent companies and these pools for putting their patents in the pools or in any way furthering the activities of these pools, and this is important.","start":414.43,"stop":438.407,"duration":23.98},{"text":"No supercedias was ever foiled to that judgment, even though there was an appeal, and since that first judgment was entered on April 15, 19 -- or April 5, 1965, Zenith has been operating under the protection of the injunction of the United States District Court in their activities in Kent.","start":438.407,"stop":472.495,"duration":34.09},{"text":"On appeal or in entering the last judgment after the Trial Court had heard all the evidence that was produced on the original trial press, all of the different matters which were urged and argued in a three or four-day hearing on the motions to reopen the case and after hearing everything that was submitted in the case, Trial Court made this comment, \"there could be no question in my mind that Zenith suffered damages during the damage period by a virtue of the pools which I have found and, reiterate, existed at the time of the damage period.\"","start":472.495,"stop":531.832,"duration":59.34},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed both the judgments on the ground that there is no substantial evidence in this record that Zenith was injured by the activities of these pools in its business or property, and held as a matter of law that, on this record, Zenith was not even threatened with injury by the activities of these pools.","start":531.832,"stop":571.908,"duration":40.08},{"text":"Now, the proof of injury to Zenith's business in Canada was, in a large part, documentary and I'm going into it in some detail in the course of this argument, and was not denied by any single witness or document in this case.","start":571.908,"stop":598.652,"duration":26.74},{"text":"So, It is my submission to this Court that what is presented is whether on admitted facts, which we claim in the District Court, found was unequivocal in its proof of actual substantial damage to the Zenith Corporation, whether under those admitted facts, as a matter of law, the federal antitrust laws, namely 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, do not reach and have no sanction which will stop that country.","start":598.652,"stop":651.082,"duration":52.43},{"text":"Now, before going to the individual markets, I want to -- if the Court will bear with me, I want to take just a few minutes to give some of the background of this conspiracy.","start":651.082,"stop":669.682,"duration":18.6},{"text":"And, this Court in 1962 and in subsequent cases has held, namely in the Continental Ore case, that conspiracies which are designed to control a complete market and which are put together by competitors to exclude competition permanent should not be judged by taking particular parts of the proofs and examining them and passing on to something else, but that the proof should be looked at as a whole and, in the Continental Ore case, that it was highly relevant to go back and look at the proofs at the inception of the conspiracy and the proofs out of which the conspiracy was created to show its intendment, its purpose, its effect, and its result.","start":669.682,"stop":735.23,"duration":65.55},{"text":"Now, I've been in this litigation with these pools on behalf of Zenith since 1953 and I'm not going to refer any of my own personal knowledge.","start":735.23,"stop":752.421,"duration":17.19},{"text":"Everything I'm going to tell this Court with reference to the beginning is in this record.","start":752.421,"stop":759.799,"duration":7.38},{"text":"And, may I say at the threshold of this case, the documentary evidence in this case came in by a pretrial stipulation without any objection that documents as to their varied, all admitted, no objection to them whatever, no contravening evidence of any kind, and some of it and most of it and the part I'm now going to talk about, put in by my opponents in the Trial Court.","start":759.799,"stop":800.33,"duration":40.53},{"text":"From 1919 until 1935, through some-50 cross licensing agreements, the leading electronic companies of the world divided up the markets of the world, I'm leaving out the Iron Curtain countries.","start":800.33,"stop":824.811,"duration":24.48},{"text":"I'm talking now about the free world countries where competition is possible.","start":824.811,"stop":833.196,"duration":8.38},{"text":"Among those companies were the telephone companies: the Westinghouse Company, RCA, General Electric Company, English Electric Company, the Telefunken Company, the General Electric Company of Germany, GTS, the French Company, Standard Cables and Wireless, the Australian Company, and the Philips Company of Harland which we find everywhere which is the largest electronics company and probably the largest aggregation of capital and business in the entire world.","start":833.196,"stop":883.218,"duration":50.02},{"text":"Now, all of these companies shoulder-to-shoulder and by cross licensing agreement divided the free world up into markets and part of that was the North American Continent which was assigned to the so-called radio group.","start":883.218,"stop":901.614,"duration":18.4},{"text":"And, the radio group was composed of the telephone company, that's American telephone and telegraph company, General Electric, RCA, the Westinghouse Company, and the Philips Company.","start":901.614,"stop":920.724,"duration":19.11},{"text":"Zenith came into conflict and confrontation with this worldwide conspiracy when, in 1933, RCA with 10,000 patents in the pool which was composed of patents contributed by all the companies that I have now mentioned, some-10,000 of them, asserted them against Zenith and demanded that we take a license.","start":920.724,"stop":946.967,"duration":26.24},{"text":"And, we took the position and said so in our pleadings which are in this case that the whole industry in the United States had paid tribute to this pool for years and $1,300,000.00 or so have been paid in tribute to the pool, that the pools were illegal and we filed a suit in the United States District Court down in Delaware asking for a determination that the pools were illegal, and the case was before Judge Leigh, now dead.","start":946.967,"stop":990.184,"duration":43.22},{"text":"Immediately, the pool countered with 63 patent suits against us in that proceeding.","start":990.184,"stop":1000.262,"duration":10.08},{"text":"Parenthetically, we got the trial and one of them, it took 18 months to try it.","start":1000.262,"stop":1006.355,"duration":6.09},{"text":"If we tried them all, there wouldn't have been a lawyer left alive who'd ever had any connection with the case.","start":1006.355,"stop":1017.456,"duration":11.1},{"text":"They countered out of that suit by suing Zenith in the United States District Court in Chicago on two patents: the telephone company, RCA and General Electric.","start":1017.456,"stop":1030.924,"duration":13.47},{"text":"And, in that suit, Zenith counterclaimed and set up a suit for trouble damages claiming that they had been excluded from the market in Canada and couldn't sell their goods there because of the pool which was part of the overall conspiracy, the pool known as Canadian Radio Patents Limited.","start":1030.924,"stop":1058.92,"duration":28},{"text":"That suit got down to trial that they go to trial on September 9, 1957.","start":1058.92,"stop":1064.821,"duration":5.9},{"text":"The Sunday before it went to trial, the parties settled the case by paying Zenith $10 million, giving Zenith the patent rights inventing these black and white monochrome patents in all markets and in the

brought that in for a purpose because Zenith is represented here as, in some way, taking advantage of the antitrust laws when, I submit, on the entire record, they have done very constructive service under the antitrust laws, and they free the entire American market so that, from that time on, and the relevance of this is on the damage proof that from that time on, we had a free market in United States.","start":1099.897,"stop":1140.164,"duration":40.27},{"text":"And, with a free market, Zenith came from a little small company hardly known to the leading company in television and, I think,
