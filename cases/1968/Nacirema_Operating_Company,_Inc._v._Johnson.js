Large vessels could not because the piers instructed them.","start":217.046,"stop":232.831,"duration":15.78},{"text":"The Deputy Commissioner Oosting in Virginia and Deputy Commissioner Traynor in Maryland both found that the injuries to these men which resulted when cargo swung against the men, in the case of Joseph Klosek, he was knocked out off the gondola car to the dock and sustained fatal injuries.","start":232.831,"stop":257.118,"duration":24.29},{"text":"The other two men Johnson and Avery were pinned against the side of the railroad

upon navigable waters.","start":264.093,"stop":274.787,"duration":10.69},{"text":"The opinions of both the Deputy Commissioners were then appealed to the district courts first to the Eastern District

Virginia, Judge Watkins from the District of Maryland affirmed the findings of the Deputy Commissioner.","start":287.571,"stop":298.36,"duration":10.79},{"text":"The cases were then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.","start":298.36,"stop":304.859,"duration":6.5},{"text":"They were first, the Avery case and the Johnson and Klosek cases were first argued in separate panels, and after that they were consolidated and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit en banc heard all three cases.","start":304.859,"stop":323.201,"duration":18.34},{"text":"They reversed the two district judges.","start":323.201,"stop":327.962,"duration":4.76},{"text":"Certiorari was applied for by the Nacirema Operating Company in the Maryland case by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company in the Virginia case, and by Solicitor General on behalf of the two Deputy Commissioners and with us before the Court.","start":327.962,"stop":349.731,"duration":21.77},{"text":"The principal point upon which I rely is that for some years, the piers have been considered extensions of the land.","start":349.731,"stop":365.227,"duration":15.5},{"text":"I believe that was the law some time ago and is presently the law.","start":365.227,"stop":371.599,"duration":6.37},{"text":"The point was never mentioned by the Court of Appeals below and I think the Court of Appeals might have had somewhat difficult time answering the question.","start":371.599,"stop":385.791,"duration":14.19},{"text":"A number of cases from this Court were cited, they were on page 10 of our briefs.","start":385.791,"stop":392.448,"duration":6.66},{"text":"The most recent that I can think of, of this Court is the opinion announced by Mr. Justice Black in Swanson against Marra Brothers which I think is certainly still the law, it certainly the most well known case.","start":392.448,"stop":410.365,"duration":17.92},{"text":"I will only quote that portion of the opinion which relates to this point.","start":410.365,"stop":416.208,"duration":5.84},{"text":"“Swanson was a longshoreman who was injured on the pier when a life raft fell from the ship and injured him.”","start":416.208,"stop":424.907,"duration":8.7},{"text":"And this Court said without dissent, but since the Act, that's the Longshoreman's Act, is restricted to compensation for injuries occurring on navigable waters, it excludes from its own terms and from the Jones Act, any remedies against the employer for injuries inflicted on shore.","start":424.907,"stop":446.042,"duration":21.13},{"text":"The Act leaves the injured employees in such cases to pursue the remedies afforded by local law.","start":446.042,"stop":454.32,"duration":8.28},{"text":"The Court then and prior to that had always considered pier injuries to be shore injuries, and I submit Your Honors that that is still the law.","start":454.32,"stop":466.146,"duration":11.83},{"text":"The Court, this Court has always followed I believe, the line of demarcation which was set out in the Jensen case years ago, and that line is the line between state and federal coverage.","start":466.146,"stop":483.427,"duration":17.28},{"text":"And specifically it's the line between navigable waters and land, or extensions of the land.","start":483.427,"stop":491.877,"duration":8.45},{"text":"I think that has always been the law.","start":491.877,"stop":495.749,"duration":3.87},{"text":"So far as I know, there has never been a decision, except that of the Fourth Circuit which disputes that pier injuries are considered as land injuries.","start":495.749,"stop":510.308,"duration":14.56},{"text":"The injuries in this instance, all having occurred on the pier don't fall within the stated exception of the Act, which is any dry dock.","start":510.308,"stop":522.519,"duration":12.21},{"text":"Dry docks were explained and detailed as to what they were by Mr. Justice Douglas in Avondale Marine Ways against Henderson I think.","start":522.519,"stop":535.555,"duration":13.04},{"text":"And it was clearly pointed out that the types of dry dock referred to are not wharfs or piers, as they were in this instance.","start":535.555,"stop":545.953,"duration":10.4},{"text":"The case does not -- the injuries do not fall within the Court's exception which was in Mr. Justice Black's decision in Davis against the Department of Labor in the twilight zone.","start":545.953,"stop":559.329,"duration":13.38},{"text":"The twilight zone as I understand it is that sort of hazy area between the ship and the pier where it's difficult to determine which coverage does apply.","start":559.329,"stop":570.777,"duration":11.45},{"text":"And the Court in the twilight zone cases has held that there may be both state and federal coverage and the injured longshoreman may elect.","start":570.777,"stop":585.46,"duration":14.68},{"text":"The case most heavily relied upon by the court below was Calbeck against Travelers Insurance Company.","start":585.46,"stop":594.471,"duration":9.01},{"text":"I hope since it was discussed at some length that this Court won't consider it presumptions of me, in particularly Mr. Justice Brennan to try to state what I think that case held.","start":594.471,"stop":607.338,"duration":12.87},{"text":"I do not think that the case held as the Court of Appeals below said it held that pier injuries could be covered by the Longshoreman's Act.","start":607.338,"stop":618.568,"duration":11.23},{"text":"That was a case Your Honors will recall which involved two or more shipyard workers who were injured aboard ships which were on navigable waters under new construction.","start":618.568,"stop":633.421,"duration":14.85},{"text":"They were ships under construction.","start":633.421,"stop":636.364,"duration":2.94},{"text":"Now the Court had before it, its prior holding in 1922 of Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company against Rohde, and that case long ago had established that there was a local concern in navigable -- in ships that were under construction in navigable waters.","start":636.364,"stop":661.902,"duration":25.54},{"text":"And where there were such local concern that the State Compensation Acts could apply that there and in that instance the state acts may apply and federal coverage did not come into effect.","start":661.902,"stop":678.227,"duration":16.32},{"text":"Now, I gathered from Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion that this Court was very much concerned with whether or not in all the cases where there was local concern, and particularly in the very case it was before it there would definitely be coverage for longshoremen who were injured.","start":678.227,"stop":702.099,"duration":23.87},{"text":"There was the fear, I got from the opinion there was the fear that there might not be state or federal coverage somewhere for those men who were working in areas that the pre-1927 decisions had set aside as local concern areas.","start":702.099,"stop":724.613,"duration":22.51},{"text":"So the court in reversing the Fifth Circuit, I believe it was the Fifth Circuit, in reversing the Fifth Circuit held that what this Act meant was precisely what it said.","start":724.613,"stop":739.606,"duration":14.99},{"text":"It wanted to cover injuries which occurred to longshoreman on navigable waters.","start":739.606,"stop":746.269,"duration":6.66},{"text":"It didn't mean all injuries.","start":746.269,"stop":748.471,"duration":2.2},{"text":"It meant injuries on navigable waters.","start":748.471,"stop":751.354,"duration":2.88},{"text":"There was no dispute that there is no dispute.","start":751.354,"stop":754.686,"duration":3.33},{"text":"There can be no dispute that ships under construction just as much as ships that have been built are on navigable waters if they are afloat or in a dry dock or a marine railway.","start":754.686,"stop":767.221,"duration":12.53}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, on of these men was knocked off the pier
