even without her knowledge and consent it's held that she made a taxable gift for gift tax purposes, for estate tax purposes, it may be a gift in contemplation of debt, and yet she has nothing to say about it and so the Government's argument that the wife because the wife was merely compliant or acquiescent to her husband's wishes, somehow means that she didn't make a transfer of her property to

consequences of these large trust that he created which is almost inconceivable that a man would create trust of this size without consulting a tax adviser but he did because he wasn't concerned about
