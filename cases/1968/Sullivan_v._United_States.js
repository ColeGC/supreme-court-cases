under military orders.","start":159.333,"stop":181.093,"duration":21.76},{"text":"And further, whether Section 514 as interpreted by the Court of Appeals is an unconstitutional infringement on the

dealer.","start":299.16,"stop":304.171,"duration":5.01},{"text":"I direct the Court's attention to page 27 (a) of the record appendix on which it reproduced the invoice covering the transaction.","start":304.171,"stop":311.826,"duration":7.66},{"text":"And on the invoice, it very plainly states sales taxes were paid to the dealer.","start":311.826,"stop":320.255,"duration":8.43},{"text":"And significantly, at page 41 of the Government's brief, and this is in the second part which doesn't agree with the first part, a reference is made to this affidavit.","start":320.255,"stop":330.658,"duration":10.4},{"text":"And the reference is that Commander Foster paid a sales tax to the State of Connecticut.","start":330.658,"stop":338.317,"duration":7.66},{"text":"In this connection also, my friends from the Attorney General's office in the State of Texas tell me that I've committed a grievous error in my brief at page 6, wherein I refer to Commander Foster's affidavit and state that after paying sales tax to the State of Connecticut, Commander Foster was required to pay a use tax to the State of Texas before registering the vehicle.","start":338.317,"stop":360.408,"duration":22.09},{"text":"The Attorney General's office in Texas advises me that since 1961, Texas has had a

therein.","start":360.408,"stop":379.345,"duration":18.94},{"text":"I would ask this Court to take judicial notice of the laws of the State of Texas in that regard.","start":379.345,"stop":387.748,"duration":8.4},{"text":"One final reference to the Foster affidavit, in the lower court, when the motion for summary judgment was heard, the Government presented three affidavits to the court for its consideration.","start":387.748,"stop":403.466,"duration":15.72},{"text":"One of these was the affidavit of Commander Foster.","start":403.466,"stop":407.221,"duration":3.75},{"text":"At that time, I filed a motion to strike the affidavit from the record on the basis that Commander Foster had arrived at the misapprehension that he had paid a use tax, rather than a sales tax to the retail dealer.","start":407.221,"stop":420.369,"duration":13.15},{"text":"The District Court noted my objection, but did not rule on that objection.","start":420.369,"stop":426.601,"duration":6.23},{"text":"Under the circumstances, I renew that objection at this time, and claim that the court erred and not ruling on the motion.","start":426.601,"stop":434.748,"duration":8.15},{"text":"And I would ask that this Court disregard the Foster affidavit and its deliberations.","start":434.748,"stop":443.344,"duration":8.6},{"text":"I would like to emphasize to this Court that this is a case of first impression before the Court.","start":443.344,"stop":449.771,"duration":6.43},{"text":"In the last 25 years, since the 1944 Amendment to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, no claim has been advanced that Section 514 encompassed sales and use taxes.","start":449.771,"stop":466.377,"duration":16.61},{"text":"It wasn't until April of 1967 when this case was filed in the District Court for the District of Connecticut that the claim was made that Section 514 encompassed sales and use taxes.","start":466.377,"stop":479.747,"duration":13.37},{"text":"So that this is the first opportunity any court has had to consider the issue.","start":479.747,"stop":487.522,"duration":7.77},{"text":"It is the position of the State of Connecticut that Section 514 was designed and intended by Congress to grant immunity to servicemen from property taxes, income taxes and certain annual motor vehicle taxes in any state but its home state -- his home state.","start":487.522,"stop":508.547,"duration":21.03},{"text":"The statute accomplishes this by removing the jurisdictional grounds for the imposition of those taxes.","start":508.547,"stop":513.508,"duration":4.96},{"text":"That is residence, domicile, and situs of the property.","start":513.508,"stop":519.77,"duration":6.26},{"text":"The legislative history of Section 514 and the 1944 Amendment and the 1962 Amendment thereto supports this position.","start":519.77,"stop":531.53,"duration":11.76},{"text":"In the legislative history of this Section and the clarifying amendments, and that's what they were characterized at the time they were proposed to Congress as clarifying Amendments, not a broadening of the tax immunity already granted by Congress.","start":531.53,"stop":547.681,"duration":16.15},{"text":"The committee hearings and the reports of committees contain not one single reference to sales and use taxes.","start":547.681,"stop":557.784,"duration":10.1},{"text":"However, those committee hearings and the reports are replete with references to income and property taxes.","start":557.784,"stop":564.707,"duration":6.92},{"text":"We submit to the Court that the silence of the committee hearings and the silence of Congress as to sales and use taxes is indicative of the intention Congress in this regard.","start":564.707,"stop":581.217,"duration":16.51},{"text":"It might be pointed out too to the Court that in 1940, the Buck Act was passed which specifically granted the States the rights to collect sales and use taxes on transactions taking place on federal enclaves.","start":581.217,"stop":594.279,"duration":13.06},{"text":"So that Congress was well aware of the sales and use tax phase of taxation at the time it passed Section 514 and its Amendments.","start":594.279,"stop":607.16,"duration":12.88},{"text":"It is interesting to know that the District of Columbia which is governed by a sub-committee of Congress, I understand, has had a sales and use tax on its books since 1949, at a period of about 20 years and just two years less than the State of Connecticut has had its tax.","start":607.16,"stop":624.727,"duration":17.57},{"text":"The Government in the lower court and in its argument and in this Court is strangely silent as to the position taken by the taxing officials of the District of Columbia in this regard.","start":624.727,"stop":636.844,"duration":12.12},{"text":"Now, certainly if any taxing officials in the United States should be aware of the intention of Congress and the mood of Congress, it would be the taxing officials of the District of Columbia.","start":636.844,"stop":648.292,"duration":11.45},{"text":"I think from the silence in this regard, we can infer that the District of Columbia does not grant tax immunity on sales and use taxes on the purchases of servicemen in this area.","start":648.292,"stop":661.898,"duration":13.61},{"text":"We submit that the lower court erred when it equated a sales tax to a property tax in its decision.","start":661.898,"stop":670.432,"duration":8.53},{"text":"The only reason for equating it to a property tax was that the ultimate burden of the tax ultimately fell on the consumer.","start":670.432,"stop":679.711,"duration":9.28},{"text":"We submit that this is true of almost any tax that the ultimate burden will fall on the consumer.","start":679.711,"stop":684.916,"duration":5.21},{"text":"That is hardly a reason for equating two distinct types of taxes.","start":684.916,"stop":690.9,"duration":5.98},{"text":"The Court of Appeals compounded this error by following the same reasoning.","start":690.9,"stop":696.723,"duration":5.82},{"text":"We submit to this Court that a sales tax is not a property tax, and conversely a property tax is not a sales tax.","start":696.723,"stop":704.556,"duration":7.83},{"text":"A property tax difference from a sales tax and that it is a recurrent annual demand based on capital value of property.","start":704.556,"stop":713.417,"duration":8.86},{"text":"Whereas a sales tax is based on the purchase price or the -- it's based on the cost of acquisition or the purchase price of property.","start":713.417,"stop":724.287,"duration":10.87},{"text":"And it is only taxed one time at the date of acquisition of that property.","start":724.287,"stop":730.823,"duration":6.54},{"text":"A property tax is an ad valorem tax.","start":730.823,"stop":733.231,"duration":2.41},{"text":"And in 51 American jurisprudence at page 53, which is not in my brief, Section 26 it states it very succinctly and I'd like to read or quote for the Court.","start":733.231,"stop":745.103,"duration":11.87},{"text":"“An ad valorem tax is a tax on a fixed proportion of the value of property with respect to which the tax is assessed and requires the intervention of assessors or appraisers to estimate the value of such property before the amount due from each taxpayer may be determined.”","start":745.103,"stop":764.563,"duration":19.46},{"text":"To that definition must be added that the statutes provide a means of appeal from the assessed valuation placed on property by an assessor to a board of tax review and ultimately to the courts.","start":764.563,"stop":777.52,"duration":12.96},{"text":"So that an owner of property being assessed by a tax assessor has recourse to a board of tax review and the courts.","start":777.52,"stop":788.241,"duration":10.72},{"text":"The appellee concedes the difference between a property tax and a sales tax in his brief at page 20.","start":788.241,"stop":795.087,"duration":6.85},{"text":"But he argues that such difference should not be of real consequence in this case.","start":795.087,"stop":799.367,"duration":4.28},{"text":"We strongly disagree.","start":799.367,"stop":801.54,"duration":2.17},{"text":"At page 14 of its brief also, it claims that Congress intended that the tax exemption should be applied to any tax which is measured by the value of property, and in the sales tax area, the value is the purchase price.","start":801.54,"stop":817.327,"duration":15.79},{"text":"With this we must also strongly disagree.","start":817.327,"stop":823.618,"duration":6.29},{"text":"The value in taxation or the word value in taxation is peculiarly applicable to personal property taxation.","start":823.618,"stop":832.548,"duration":8.93},{"text":"It does not have the same meaning as purchase price in sales taxation.","start":832.548,"stop":837.703,"duration":5.15},{"text":"As stated earlier, an ad valorem taxation of property, a value is placed on property by an assessor who is usually a public official before the tax is levied.","start":837.703,"stop":849.702,"duration":12},{"text":"And the owner of the property has the right of appeal to the board of tax review or to the courts for relief from the amount of the assessment.","start":849.702,"stop":858.454,"duration":8.75},{"text":"In the sales and use tax area, the tax is based on the purchased price of property.","start":858.454,"stop":864.573,"duration":6.12},{"text":"The purchase price is set at the whim of the retailer, and if the purchaser wants the property, he pays the purchase price without recourse to anyone.","start":864.573,"stop":875.135,"duration":10.56},{"text":"If I may give a concrete example of the two taxes, I would suggest that we let represent or let represent two neighbors in a given community and label them A and B. Each owns the same model and year automobile.","start":875.135,"stop":891.192,"duration":16.06},{"text":"For local property tax purposes the tax assessor places A's automobile on the tax list at the value of $2,000.00.","start":891.192,"stop":899.379,"duration":8.19},{"text":"He places B's car on the list at $4,000.00.","start":899.379,"stop":903.323,"duration":3.94},{"text":"In this case, B has recourse to the board of tax review and the courts to have his valuation of $4,000.00 reduced to equalize his pays with A.","start":903.323,"stop":915.562,"duration":12.24},{"text":"In the same manner, when A and B acquired these vehicles, A very well might have had connections in the automotive field which allowed him to buy the automobile at the wholesale price of $3,000.00.","start":915.562,"stop":930.478,"duration":14.92},{"text":"The sales tax would apply to the purchase price of $3,000.00.","start":930.478,"stop":935.425,"duration":4.95},{"text":"In the same manner, B who didn't have the same connections might have to pay the full retail price of $5,000.00.","start":935.425,"stop":942.941,"duration":7.52},{"text":"In this case, the sales tax would be applied to the $5,000.00 figure and neither B nor A could complain about the price.","start":942.941,"stop":951.759,"duration":8.82},{"text":"The tax is on the actual purchase price of property.","start":951.759,"stop":957.359,"duration":5.6},{"text":"We should submit that the Court should give short shift to the arguments of the Government in this regard.","start":957.359,"stop":963.881,"duration":6.52},{"text":"The Government in its brief, places great emphasis on the two leading cases under Section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, which were decided by this Court.","start":963.881,"stop":978.606,"duration":14.73},{"text":"They are Dameron versus Brodhead, California versus Buzard.","start":978.606,"stop":981.923,"duration":3.32},{"text":"Both of which are cited in all of the briefs submitted to this Court.","start":981.923,"stop":987.108,"duration":5.18},{"text":"We submit however, than rather than support the Government's position.","start":987.108,"stop":991.213,"duration":4.11},{"text":"These cases support the State's position.","start":991.213,"stop":994.278,"duration":3.07},{"text":"For example, in Dameron versus Brodhead which involved an ad valorem property tax on the property of a serviceman serving in Colorado, he was a Louisiana resident at that time.","start":994.278,"stop":1008.557,"duration":14.28},{"text":"This Court in striking down the ad valorem property tax stated “In fact though the evils of potential” -- and I quote, excuse me, from page 326 of the decision.","start":1008.557,"stop":1021.088,"duration":12.53},{"text":"“In fact, though the evils of multiple taxation, may have given rise to this provision, Congress appears to have chosen the broader technique of the statute carefully freeing servicemen from both income and property taxes imposed by any State by virtue of their presence there as a result of military orders.","start":1021.088,"stop":1039.105,"duration":18.02},{"text":"It saved the sole right of taxation to the state of original residence whether or not that State exercise the right.”","start":1039.105,"stop":1047.34,"duration":8.23},{"text":"Again, in California versus Buzard, in which the issue was the arrest, prosecution and conviction of Captain Buzard for driving an unregistered motor vehicle on the highways of California, this Court at page 387 opened its decision with the following paragraph and I quote again.","start":1047.34,"stop":1069.653,"duration":22.31},{"text":"“Section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, 56.777 as amended, provides a nonresident serviceman present in the State in compliance with military orders with a broad immunity from that State's personal property and income taxation.”","start":1069.653,"stop":1088.232,"duration":18.58},{"text":"The 2% license fee which was involved in the Buzard case was a substitute for an ad valorem property tax which California had found difficult to administer.","start":1088.232,"stop":1096.677,"duration":8.44},{"text":"So then, both the Dameron case, which involved an ad valorem property tax, and in the Buzard case which involved a 2% license fee as substitute for an ad valorem tax, this Court emphasized that it was dealing with an immunity granted by Congress from income and property taxes.","start":1096.677,"stop":1115.732,"duration":19.06},{"text":"Again at page 393 of the Buzard decision, this Court states and I quote, “The very purpose of 514 -- Section 514 in broadly frame a

military orders.","start":1115.732,"stop":1139.052,"duration":23.32},{"text":"The statute operates whether or not the home state imposes or assesses such taxes against him.”","start":1139.052,"stop":1144.283,"duration":5.23},{"text":"Again, the reference is to property taxes and income taxes.","start":1144.283,"stop":1153.356,"duration":9.07},{"text":"The court, pardon me, the appellee in his brief places great emphasis on this reference to the Buzard case, the latter statement concerning income and property taxes.","start":1153.356,"stop":1167.779,"duration":14.42},{"text":"He quotes it at pages 12, 19 and 26 of the first part of its brief.","start":1167.779,"stop":1173.781,"duration":6},{"text":"However, he very conveniently or it very conveniently leaves out the reference to income and property taxation so that the out-of-context phrase that is quoted by the Government at the top of page 12 is, and I quote “the very purpose of Section 514 ***, was to relieve *** to servicemen of the burden of supporting the Governments of the States where he was present solely in compliance with military orders.”","start":1173.781,"stop":1200.526,"duration":26.75},{"text":"The three asterisks denote the deletion of the

taxes.","start":1241.21,"stop":1259.121,"duration":17.91},{"text":"At page 37 of its brief, in note 27, the appellee advances a novel argument that servicemen who are on furlough are no longer absent from their home state by virtue of military orders.","start":1259.121,"stop":1272.748,"duration":13.63},{"text":"In effect, this means that a Texas serviceman stationed in Connecticut who was given a three-day pass, as soon as he is given the three-day pass his status immediately changes so that he becomes subject to sales and use taxes in Connecticut and in any other State that he might visit on his furlough under the decision of our lower court in this case.","start":1272.748,"stop":1296.636,"duration":23.89},{"text":"At the end of his furlough, the mantle of tax immunity immediately falls
