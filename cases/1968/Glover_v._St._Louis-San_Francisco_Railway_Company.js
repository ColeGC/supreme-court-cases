here purely and simply on the pleadings.","start":75.456,"stop":80.875,"duration":5.42},{"text":"The plaintiffs were 14 railroad carmen helpers.","start":80.875,"stop":87.432,"duration":6.56},{"text":"Their complaint in the District Court charged a cooperative scheme by the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad Co. and their brotherhood, the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen, to perpetuate a long-existing racial discrimination in the area of seniority by the device of using what they call apprentices to do the traditional work of carmen helpers.","start":87.432,"stop":120.099,"duration":32.67},{"text":"They use quite apprentices, so that the Negro carmen helpers will continue not to get promoted to the classification of carmen.","start":120.099,"stop":133.985,"duration":13.89},{"text":"This device has caused a bottleneck in seniority which affects not only the Negro carmen helpers, but the White carmen helpers unfortunate enough to be behind them on the seniority roster.","start":133.985,"stop":148.653,"duration":14.67},{"text":"The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs had not alleged in exhaustion, one, of their remedy before the National Railroad Adjustment Board, two, their remedy within the Union itself and, three, their remedy provided by the collective bargaining agreement.","start":148.653,"stop":174.338,"duration":25.69},{"text":"There were no specific allegations in the complaint as to the character of these two supposed contractual remedies or even if they existed, but the District Court nevertheless concluded that they both were, as he said, \"available\" and must be employed.","start":174.338,"stop":198.71,"duration":24.37},{"text":"The Fifth Circuit affirmed and this Court has granted certiorari.","start":198.71,"stop":205.83,"duration":7.12},{"text":"Let me say that some people don't like the concept of seniority as the criterion for job assignment and promotion.","start":205.83,"stop":215.734,"duration":9.9},{"text":"I don't think it is for me to be for or against this concept.","start":215.734,"stop":221.093,"duration":5.36},{"text":"It's just a fact of labor life, and racial discrimination in the application of this concept is where discrimination hurts the most.","start":221.093,"stop":234.865,"duration":13.77},{"text":"It hurts the pocketbook, and I submit that to eliminate invidious discrimination in this area can lead ultimately to its elimination in other sectors of our national life.","start":234.865,"stop":252.584,"duration":17.72},{"text":"While I was on the airplane coming up from Birmingham with the plane jumping up and down, I grab a hold

news to me.","start":296.759,"stop":300.382,"duration":3.62},{"text":"Two, despite that disclaimer, there are a couple of things in this article that I'd like to read and that I think have particular bearing.","start":300.382,"stop":310.498,"duration":10.12},{"text":"The sub-headline says \"for nearly a century, most Unions have forced Negros into Jim Crow logos, giving them dirty jobs or refuse

prejudice.","start":321.48,"stop":326.091,"duration":4.61},{"text":"And then, down in the body, it says this.","start":326.091,"stop":328.181,"duration":2.09},{"text":"\"Union controlled apprenticeship programs,\" fits this one like a glove, \"admit far less than token numbers of Negros,\" and then \"Unions are doggedly battling civil rights complaints that are before the Courts and government agencies.\"","start":328.181,"stop":348.235,"duration":20.05},{"text":"Despite landmark Court decisions in 1967 and 1968, the Union seemed determined to fight a rear guard holding action reminiscent of the one thought by southern school districts after the Supreme Court's 1954 school desegregation decision.","start":348.235,"stop":368.978,"duration":20.74},{"text":"Now, if we may, let's see where the lower Court's reasoning in this case would lead these plaintiffs.","start":368.978,"stop":379.81,"duration":10.83},{"text":"First, what about the internal Union complaint procedures?","start":379.81,"stop":386.218,"duration":6.41},{"text":"The Trial Court said that such procedures were there so, for the sake of argument, we'll have to assume, I suppose, that they are there.","start":386.218,"stop":398.098,"duration":11.88},{"text":"It would be unbecoming of me to go outside the record to describe these intra-Union procedures.","start":398.098,"stop":406.032,"duration":7.93},{"text":"There are no allegations as to what they are, no allegations by the plaintiffs, no allegations by the defendants.","start":406.032,"stop":413.604,"duration":7.57},{"text":"However, I think in -- it's not unsophisticated, but this Court, just as I know it, to know that the plaintiffs could not get damages.","start":413.604,"stop":430.724,"duration":17.12},{"text":"Damages, that's one of the things they are suing for, damages, money damages for past discrimination from the Union.","start":430.724,"stop":437.964,"duration":7.24},{"text":"If they go through the Union constitution, such as it is, are they going to be able to ask for and get what they're asking here, damages?","start":437.964,"stop":447.329,"duration":9.37},{"text":"It is just as easy, I think, to know that they cannot get promotion from the Union.","start":447.329,"stop":452.928,"duration":5.6},{"text":"The Union doesn't promote people.","start":452.928,"stop":457.18,"duration":4.25},{"text":"The best that they theoretically could hope for with the Union alone would be an admission by the Union by some top decision making body or policy making body of the Union that the Union was wrong in failing to take their grievance to the company.","start":457.18,"stop":478.072,"duration":20.89},{"text":"It's all they could hope for with the Union procedures.","start":478.072,"stop":480.722,"duration":2.65}]},{"speakerName":"Potter

theoretically.","start":517.524,"stop":540.919,"duration":23.39},{"text":"Now, what could they expect from the company if they process the grievance without the Union's blessing and in the face of its active opposition?","start":540.919,"stop":551.632,"duration":10.71},{"text":"The actual grievance machinery here again is not spelled out in the complaint but, in these matters, it's easy to know that they would get nowhere.","start":551.632,"stop":564.231,"duration":12.6},{"text":"If they sought redress with the company in the face and in the teeth of their own Union's opposition and collusion then, according to the Fifth Circuit, the Court from which this case comes in Haynes against U.S. Pipe, a case that was cited in -- by the District Court in its memorandum opinion, then there would be no judicial review.","start":564.231,"stop":589.826,"duration":25.6},{"text":"The Fifth Circuit is not saying that you exhaust your administrative remedies within the company and, if you're not satisfied, you then go to Court.","start":589.826,"stop":598.15,"duration":8.32},{"text":"They're saying, in Haynes, you exhaust your administrative remedy within the company even if the last and ultimate method that the employee employs is to get his Union to strike, and if that doesn't work, he's finished.","start":598.15,"stop":618.833,"duration":20.68},{"text":"This is what the Fifth Circuit says.","start":618.833,"stop":621.971,"duration":3.14},{"text":"\"At this point, the decision denying him relief was final under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement or the processes of the now available to him for contesting or avoiding that final decision.\"","start":621.971,"stop":634.158,"duration":12.19},{"text":"We're talking now about intra-company procedures and, in that case, the Fifth Circuit said \"appellant does not contend that the Union did not faithfully represent him.\"","start":634.158,"stop":643.492,"duration":9.33},{"text":"That may be a

Union.","start":645.252,"stop":649.803,"duration":4.55},{"text":"This is a run of the Mine case where the grievance procedure was followed and the adverse decision against appellant became final.","start":649.803,"stop":657.054,"duration":7.25},{"text":"Being dissatisfied, he sought to start anew in the face of the Bar in the final decision under the grievance procedure, which means the Fifth Circuit in Haynes would say that unless the plaintiffs here would bite off the tremendous burden after having exhausted this machinery if the District Court and the Fifth Circuit say we must exhaust, unless we want to bite off the burden and take on the burden of proving fraud on the part of the Union in the company, fraud, then we have no judicial review.","start":657.054,"stop":691.122,"duration":34.07},{"text":"We've reached the end of the road by referring this matter to the grievance machine.","start":691.122,"stop":698.921,"duration":7.8},{"text":"Now, what could the plaintiffs reasonably expect from the National Railroad Adjustment
