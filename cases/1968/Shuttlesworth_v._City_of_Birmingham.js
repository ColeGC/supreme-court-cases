on page 143.","start":337.402,"stop":360.544,"duration":23.14},{"text":"And his position was that the permit ordinance is unconstitutional because it is vague and includes such terms as welfare,

Hopkins.","start":375.639,"stop":391.605,"duration":15.97},{"text":"And he also held this third point that there was no need shown, no state interest shown in enforcing an ordinance of this sort

the statute and he said, here's the statute contains the words “decency and morals and welfare and the various other vague terms” he said but I read all those terms out of the statutes so those words

statute.","start":434.16,"stop":437.046,"duration":2.89},{"text":"And after having read that out, he read into the statute of those traffic considerations and considerations that avert to convenience of the public which is the basis of Cox decision and the Supreme Court of Alabama said that's right.","start":437.046,"stop":450.686,"duration":13.64},{"text":"We read out the bad words and read them some good words and therefore the conviction stands.","start":450.686,"stop":455.607,"duration":4.92},{"text":"Now, our position in this case in summary is that under decisions of this Court, it uniformly has been held that a permit ordinance which imposes a prior restraint in First Amendment rights may be disobeyed with impunity if it is unconstitutional on its face and this Court has held that in Staub versus Baxley and Lovell against Griffin and case after case since then.","start":455.607,"stop":484.464,"duration":28.86},{"text":"There seems to be -- it seems to be conceded that the language and question of just to take three of the terms: welfare, decency, and morals are so vague that they aren't unconstitutional.","start":484.464,"stop":496.428,"duration":11.96},{"text":"Indeed, that's why they were read out of the statute by Judge Johnson and by the Alabama Supreme

rewritten.","start":543.188,"stop":552.929,"duration":9.74},{"text":"First, it cannot be applied to convict this petition or who acted before it was rewritten and secondly, we claim it is not

review.","start":552.929,"stop":571.341,"duration":18.41},{"text":"Secondly, we claim that five years after the event, the statute cannot be reconstructed without filing motions of fair notice to convict this petitioner would go in a substantive sense distinguished from the procedural sense such a rewritten statute that might by constitutional.","start":571.341,"stop":593.369,"duration":22.03},{"text":"Now, under decisions of this Court as I stated at the outset, a march made without a permit contrary to a regulation requiring a permit is constitutional and is protected by the First Amendment if the permit, ordinance, or regulation is unconstitutional on its face.","start":593.369,"stop":616.345,"duration":22.98},{"text":"Now, it's conceded that this ordinance is unconstitutional on its face and I've seen no arguments serious otherwise made to the contrary.","start":616.345,"stop":626.28,"duration":9.93},{"text":"An alternative would be if the Staub doctrine and the Lovell doctrine were not the law of this Court that dissenters before they marched would have to engage in expensive litigation as in, let us say the Dombrowski case or would have to submit themselves to lengthy administrative proceedings and there would be chill upon free expression.","start":626.28,"stop":653.77,"duration":27.49},{"text":"A petitioner in case such as this would be in a especially grave disadvantage in an administrative proceeding because and in a judicial proceeding because the scope of review on appeal in the Alabama courts is so circumscribed that in dealing with a vague statute, he would have great difficulty in proving just what right of his head been denied.","start":653.77,"stop":676.649,"duration":22.88},{"text":"But this ordinance like the one in the Cox case was construed in the Supreme Court of Alabama for the first time apparently to make it constitutional and it held, but was held below the Cox save the ordinance and save the conviction.","start":676.649,"stop":691.293,"duration":14.64},{"text":"Our position is as I stated before that even if this were the case it could not save the ordinance in the sense that it could convict this petitioner.","start":691.293,"stop":699.978,"duration":8.68},{"text":"We distinguish the Cox case on a variety of grounds.","start":699.978,"stop":703.596,"duration":3.62},{"text":"First of all, in Cox, there was a statute which was essentially blank as to standard and it is conceivable that one might have read that ordinance and he said, well, what is it they mean and reasonably might apply the traffic considerations.","start":703.596,"stop":718.587,"duration":14.99},{"text":"But here's a statute which quite explicitly has other standards that welfare, decency, good order, and so forth and one need not be at a loss to guess what the state means.","start":718.587,"stop":728.293,"duration":9.71},{"text":"The state means these various vague general things which one can't really -- about which one really can't predict whether one is entitled to march or not.","start":728.293,"stop":737.779,"duration":9.49}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"And so case have any -- does New

case on the contrary has a series of vague standards and its while, I would not agree with this but it would be conceivable to say that one might imagine that standards could be imported into a statute which is silent.","start":753.826,"stop":768.239,"duration":14.41},{"text":"I think it is asking a great deal to expect a layman or indeed a lawyer to read out of a statute a series of vague standards then to read into the statute of series of traffic type standards.","start":768.239,"stop":779.03,"duration":10.79},{"text":"Secondly, as we point out in our brief, the Cox case was decided in some of the earlier days of First Amendment jurisprudence in this Court and it may be that the Court at this time was not sufficiently alert to the chilling effect that such a retroactive interpretation might have and further that the Court had not really fully developed its jurisprudence of First Amendment rights to apply to march as in parading or picketing of that sort.","start":779.03,"stop":811.295,"duration":32.26},{"text":"But in any event, even if the statute could be said to be now made constitutional in retrospect of the by reading out and reading in, we say that in a procedural sense, it is not constitutional in the sense of the -- of Bantam Books case and the Interstate Circuit case which says that on First Amendment rights it denied they must be speedy, precise, and efficacious opportunity for review and that none of that exist here ago.","start":811.295,"stop":839.001,"duration":27.71},{"text":"It's not even as reconstructive standards like

might call political rights.","start":860.293,"stop":869.942,"duration":9.65},{"text":"Because I think it might be argued that in the case involving a book or a motion picture for example, while it is undesirable and it is unconstitutional to frustrate or delay the publication or the showing of the motion picture that something which involves the political considerations in which timeliness is exceedingly important and the necessity for avoiding delay is crucial as it was in this case.","start":869.942,"stop":894.939,"duration":25},{"text":"The Good Friday March had a significance on Good

itself.","start":914.211,"stop":919.922,"duration":5.71},{"text":"Perhaps, it wasn't raised in the case that to the fair notice doctrine.","start":919.922,"stop":924.761,"duration":4.84},{"text":"This petitioner, according to the law as it stood then and as he under any reason besides the degree of the statute had reason to believe that he could march with

him.","start":938.304,"stop":945.055,"duration":6.75},{"text":"In this Court, not long ago in this case of Bouie against City of Columbia which was one of the “sit-in” cases dealt with the trespass

no evidence concerning that.","start":1022.725,"stop":1026.883,"duration":4.16},{"text":"There are no reasons to be given as to where the permit is denied.","start":1026.883,"stop":1030.638,"duration":3.75},{"text":"There was an effort to develop upon cross-examination of the witness Sarah Nagar (ph) who gave out the permits.","start":1030.638,"stop":1040.729,"duration":10.09},{"text":"When questioned -- developed when permits are granted and when they are denied and are they given for walking in the sidewalks as

some suggestions about judicial review but as the best we can divide from Alabama law judicial review would then at least involve 30 days for answering the trial court and there are no stated precise periods for appeal from the Supreme Court of Alabama and the scope of review was extremely narrow would be by mandamus or certiorari at which all one reviews is the discretion of the grant or order of
