earlier.","start":394.907,"stop":403.277,"duration":8.37},{"text":"This is before this comment that the party's official position about Negroes was an adoption of the position of Abraham Lincoln namely that this country should send Negroes back to Africa.","start":403.277,"stop":418.995,"duration":15.72},{"text":"Moreover, the remark in question was not followed by any exhortations to the

way.","start":418.995,"stop":433.447,"duration":14.45},{"text":"Rather, immediately following this remark is a classic call to organize politically and nonviolently to

injunction.","start":733.207,"stop":742.308,"duration":9.1},{"text":"Since then, a sound equipment statute arguably bad under Seija versus New York has been passed by the

first.","start":771.708,"stop":778.152,"duration":6.44},{"text":"This Court has currently given some time to trial counsel, co-counsel here Mr. Zinman in order that he might relate some of the factual circumstances that might clear up this issue somewhat more.","start":778.152,"stop":791.187,"duration":13.03},{"text":"He'll take five minutes to do that when I had finished.","start":791.187,"stop":795.181,"duration":3.99},{"text":"We believe that this case is not moot because we believe we come within two

this Court has always recognized exceptions to the mootness requirements.","start":806.334,"stop":812.958,"duration":6.62},{"text":"We cite a law review article by Diamond and generally in our brief.","start":812.958,"stop":819.699,"duration":6.74},{"text":"And in that -- in the course of that article, there is a summary of one of the exceptions to mootness which we feel we fall within.","start":819.699,"stop":828.447,"duration":8.75},{"text":"It bans perhaps quoting here this short, “Although the controlling fact situation may be so changed that the specific relief sort is no longer possible.”","start":828.447,"stop":840.323,"duration":11.88},{"text":"If the situation is self perpetuating, the parties are entitled to an adjudication which will apply to the renewed phase

perpetuating.","start":851.418,"stop":855.854,"duration":4.44},{"text":"These petitioners have been informed that they will not be able to speak in Princess Anne County Maryland unless they sense of their remarks.","start":855.854,"stop":863.658,"duration":7.8},{"text":"We have cited in our brief the South Pacific case where -- Southern Pacific case excuse me, where this Court said that short term order is capable of repetition will not defeat a claim for mootness.","start":863.658,"stop":879.748,"duration":16.09},{"text":"We've cited two other cases in our brief which we think point out the difference between moot claims and none moot claims.","start":879.748,"stop":886.432,"duration":6.68},{"text":"One is oil workers where the Court found mootness to exist.","start":886.432,"stop":892.432,"duration":6},{"text":"The other is Motor Coach where the Court found no mootness to exist.","start":892.432,"stop":896.334,"duration":3.9},{"text":"In both cases, the Governor's seizure of a public utility was at issue and the Governor had returned the property.","start":896.334,"stop":905.299,"duration":8.97},{"text":"The difference was that the underlying factual dispute was present in one case in Motor Coach and not present in the other.","start":905.299,"stop":914.786,"duration":9.49},{"text":"That underlying factual dispute was a strike which ended in the one case and which continued in the other.","start":914.786,"stop":922.309,"duration":7.52},{"text":"We think that the Sideburn case decided last term by this Court also points out a kind of exception this Court will -- it takes normal mootness claims.","start":922.309,"stop":935.858,"duration":13.55},{"text":"There, it was pointed out that failures in state procedure will not be allowed as a course for mootness.","start":935.858,"stop":942.199,"duration":6.34},{"text":"Now, we think that there are specific failures of state procedure here which this Court in Freidman versus Maryland has already analyzed and condemned.","start":942.199,"stop":951.271,"duration":9.07},{"text":"There this Court, looking at the censorship statute noted that there was no prompt way to get judicial review in the State of Maryland.","start":951.271,"stop":959.778,"duration":8.51},{"text":"It compared Maryland procedure with New York procedure.","start":959.778,"stop":963.449,"duration":3.67},{"text":"Under New York procedure, under Maryland procedure, it found that the statute talked about prompt administrative determination but it said that there was no assurance of prompt judicial review and this Court didn't really know how prompt administrative determination had to be.","start":963.449,"stop":980.755,"duration":17.31},{"text":"In New York on the other hand, there is clear, definite language by the time limits as this Court said.","start":980.755,"stop":987.728,"duration":6.97},{"text":"For example, a judge had to in New York hand down his opinion within two days after a matter was heard.","start":987.728,"stop":996.067,"duration":8.34},{"text":"That kind of time limit saved the censorship statute in New York and didn't save censorship in Maryland and we submit that in this case, we have that kind situation.","start":996.067,"stop":1005.853,"duration":9.79},{"text":"Moreover, Walker versus Birmingham is procedurally relevant here, because the court there criticized petitioners for making no efforts to challenge the injunction there.","start":1005.853,"stop":1017.42,"duration":11.57},{"text":"And the court gave every indication that if petitioners had made efforts and if petitioners had met with delay, this Court would have decided the case.","start":1017.42,"stop":1029.395,"duration":11.98},{"text":"Yet I believe that that case could not have gotten to this Court either before it became moot.","start":1029.395,"stop":1035.686,"duration":6.29},{"text":"For the demonstration, it was hoped to be held on an Easter Sunday and the injunction was issued some two or three days before hand and even under available procedure.","start":1035.686,"stop":1046.22,"duration":10.53},{"text":"They could not have gotten here so I think there's an indication in the opinion that this Court would have decided that ex parte temporary injunction case because it related to free speech.","start":1046.22,"stop":1056.194,"duration":9.97},{"text":"The court -- this --","start":1056.194,"stop":1056.889,"duration":0.69}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't think the indication was that the case could have gotten here in time in the Walker against Birmingham but rather that if the petitioners have gone to the trial court in Alabama and had been met with a rebuff or a delay, and then had proceeded to hold their parade, the case would have been presented here ultimately in quite a different posture.","start":1056.889,"stop":1078.356,"duration":21.47}]},{"speakerName":"Eleanor Holmes Norton","textObjs":[{"text":"That's possible Your Honor but another procedure would have been just as much open to them would have been to somehow seek appeal here and they would have been uncertain as to whether or not to violate the injunction then or not.","start":1078.356,"stop":1096.796,"duration":18.44},{"text":"It certainly is worth noting that this Court in Walker and Birmingham expressed considerable doubt as to the injunction and statute involved even though it didn't have to decide that question because it was a First Amendment case and it had an ex parte injunction in it.","start":1096.796,"stop":1111.738,"duration":14.94},{"text":"We believe that these procedural and substantive reasons which are applicable to cases generally apply here, but we believe this case
