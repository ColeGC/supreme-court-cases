it.","start":346.531,"stop":371.632,"duration":25.1},{"text":"It was further alleged that National Securities did not disclose to Producers Life or its stockholders that it intended to impose both of

here.","start":507.313,"stop":533.792,"duration":26.48},{"text":"The District Court accepted this contention as one of its grounds of decision and the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's

terms.","start":549.793,"stop":557.255,"duration":7.46},{"text":"The relevant portion for this part of my argument appears on pages 156 and 157 of the appendix near the bottom of page 156, we are left then with a general intention to set the insurance business outside the scope of all existing and future legislation regulating interstate commerce without any more direct evidence that Congress had in mind in the Securities Exchange Act.","start":557.255,"stop":588.145,"duration":30.89},{"text":"However, Congress was apparently seeking to define an exemption for insurance and then the word is conterminous but I supposed we usually say co-terminus with its power to regulate interstate commerce.","start":588.145,"stop":606.858,"duration":18.71},{"text":"The Court is there saying that with respect to insurance in so far as Congress would have power to regulate any aspect of it under its commerce power, the effect of the McCarran Act is to say that that power is not being exercised.","start":606.858,"stop":626.399,"duration":19.54},{"text":"And over on page 157, just above the middle, the court said and equally vital purpose of the McCarran Act was to preserve intact from any federal intrusion based on the Commerce Clause existing and future state regulation of the insurance industry.","start":626.399,"stop":650.973,"duration":24.57},{"text":"Thus the sole issue is here whether this construction of the McCarran-Ferguson Act and determination of its effect are correct.","start":650.973,"stop":663.46,"duration":12.49},{"text":"Or whether the facts alleged are sufficient state of cause of action under Section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 despite the provisions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act which was passed in 1946.","start":663.46,"stop":683.525,"duration":20.06},{"text":"I will now turn to the legal questions involved in the case.","start":683.525,"stop":690.791,"duration":7.27},{"text":"It maybe that I have a somewhat narrow alleged stand on but I think the footing is firm.","start":690.791,"stop":700.244,"duration":9.45},{"text":"When Section10 (b) was enacted in 1934, there was no doubt that it applied to fraud and the purchase and sale of all securities, you'll recall the phrase in the statute is any security including those in insurance companies.","start":700.244,"stop":722.415,"duration":22.17},{"text":"This was true despite the fact that it was the common understanding at that time that the federal government had no power to regulate “the business of insurance.”","start":722.415,"stop":736.137,"duration":13.72},{"text":"A clear distinction was evident between the business of insurance on the one hand and securities of a company which is engaged in conducting the insurance business.","start":736.137,"stop":751.58,"duration":15.44},{"text":"In 1944, the South-Eastern Underwriters case was decided followed in 1946 part of the enactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.","start":751.58,"stop":764.467,"duration":12.89},{"text":"The South-Eastern Underwriters case undoubtedly involved the conduct of the business of insurance the way in which insurance companies operate together in fixing their rates and had nothing to do with transactions in securities of an insurance company.","start":764.467,"stop":783.125,"duration":18.66},{"text":"The distinction was explicitly made in the McCarran-Ferguson Act itself for it said that no Act of Congress should supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.","start":783.125,"stop":801.239,"duration":18.11},{"text":"Now these was emphasized in the report of the House Committee set forth on page 24 of our brief where the Committee said, it is not the intention of Congress in the enactment of this legislation the closest states with any power to regulate or tax the business of insurance beyond that which they had been held to possess prior to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the South-Eastern Underwriters Association case.","start":801.239,"stop":839.172,"duration":37.93},{"text":"In short, the function of the McCarran-Ferguson Act was to restore the status quo to put things back where they were before the South-Eastern Underwriters case was decided except that it was made explicit that the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act should apply to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law.","start":839.172,"stop":875.425,"duration":36.25},{"text":"It was only with respect to these three statutes that there is any indication that federal law should apply only if there was not an applicable provision in state law.","start":875.425,"stop":891.5,"duration":16.08},{"text":"Throughout their history, both before and after the enactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the provisions of the securities law relating to securities and the security's law don't relate to the business of insurance.","start":891.5,"stop":911.905,"duration":20.4},{"text":"The provisions of the securities law is relating to securities have been regarded as applicable to securities and insurance companies.","start":911.905,"stop":922.848,"duration":10.94},{"text":"We have listed many of these instances in the footnotes on pages 16 and 17 of our
