failing to rebut the natural inference resulting from the educational disparity, the lack of equal educational opportunity afforded Negro voters of today when they were school children that the literacy test has borne more heavily on them and would continue to do so.","start":334.931,"stop":368.475,"duration":33.54},{"text":"I want to make clear that in our view either of the first two grounds is sufficient to support the judgment denying exemption to Gaston County.","start":368.475,"stop":381.768,"duration":13.29},{"text":"On the other hand, I proposed to focus on the third ground.","start":381.768,"stop":388.795,"duration":7.03},{"text":"The reason for that is in part that the failure with respect to proof or concerning municipal elections while the sufficient ground does seem to us to be somewhat tentative one, it's a little -- the tail wagging of the dog.","start":388.795,"stop":408.345,"duration":19.55},{"text":"It does not come to the heart of the policy of the Voting Rights Act.","start":408.345,"stop":415.581,"duration":7.24},{"text":"The second ground while again quite sufficient does have a somewhat punitive character and that if in the past three years, Negro illiterates have been afforded full opportunity to come on the rolls, it may be that the registration of white illiterates has in that sense been cured and that the discrimination has in a real sense been largely eliminated.","start":415.581,"stop":445.496,"duration":29.91},{"text":"Now that is not the test under the Act under so long as there has been discrimination within the prior five years, Gaston County would have to wait another two years.","start":445.496,"stop":457.305,"duration":11.81},{"text":"But still, it seems to us you get more of the central issue to focus on the ground which is the ground that the District Court, majority of the District Court thought.","start":457.305,"stop":469.852,"duration":12.55},{"text":"The sound is on which to base his judgment.","start":469.852,"stop":474.126,"duration":4.27},{"text":"It is of course also a ground which presents the question of recurring importance which sooner or later will have to come before the court in this case or another.","start":474.126,"stop":486.31,"duration":12.18},{"text":"It also has the different consequence.","start":486.31,"stop":489.336,"duration":3.03},{"text":"This appears on my somewhat inadequate answer to Mr. Justice Stewart yesterday.","start":489.336,"stop":495.959,"duration":6.62},{"text":"Under the Act, after the five years are up and jurisdiction wins the exemption, there is an additional five-year period during which the jurisdiction of the District Court is retained and the Court is instructed to entertain an application by the Attorney General during that period under the same standards as would have applied during the previous five-year period.","start":495.959,"stop":523.393,"duration":27.43},{"text":"And if the effect of the disparity with respect to education were continuing in the second five-year period, there would then be justification for a suit of that kind.","start":523.393,"stop":536.409,"duration":13.02},{"text":"And that would be, that probability seems likely only with respect to the state ground.","start":536.409,"stop":545.438,"duration":9.03},{"text":"So the basis of the judgment may have a very important practical impact.","start":545.438,"stop":551.744,"duration":6.31},{"text":"And finally, this third ground looks in one sense to the past that is the educational disparity.","start":551.744,"stop":558.912,"duration":7.17},{"text":"On the other hand, it quite realistically looks to the future unlikely through the priority grounds.","start":558.912,"stop":565.282,"duration":6.37},{"text":"In the sense that what is being tested here is whether the discrimination of the past still has a lingering effect and will in years to come for that reason not because the education of disparity has had a discriminatory effect but because it will continue to have for some time to come, it seems to us that this basis for the judgment is the one that ought to be focused on.","start":565.282,"stop":601.273,"duration":35.99},{"text":"It seems to us also that this ground of position is faithful to the legislative intent.","start":601.273,"stop":610.417,"duration":9.14},{"text":"We must remember that at the time the suspension of test was proposed in the Congress, the argument ran that that was an unnecessary radical procedure that it was quite sufficient if the complaint were that the illiterates, white illiterates have been registered and that same privilege with the non-Negroes.","start":610.417,"stop":631.823,"duration":21.41},{"text":"The way to cure that was to require or at least offer the states the alternative of the complete re-registration.","start":631.823,"stop":639.457,"duration":7.63},{"text":"The answer made to that suggestion by the Attorney General and reproduce to both committee reports is that -- that would not have solved the problem because the reinstruction of the literacy test would bear more heavily on the Negro voters precisely because they have denied the same educational opportunities.","start":639.457,"stop":661.306,"duration":21.85},{"text":"So we're dealing here with a grounded decision which the Congress itself focused on.","start":661.306,"stop":673.16,"duration":11.85},{"text":"Now I must concede as Justice Stewart pointed out yesterday that the result of this argument is one that the Congress apparently did not fully appreciate at the time.","start":673.16,"stop":692.125,"duration":18.97},{"text":"But there are several things that are to be said about that.","start":692.125,"stop":696.92,"duration":4.79},{"text":"First, the Act is I think I pointed out yesterday does not deal merely with literacy test.","start":696.92,"stop":701.502,"duration":4.58},{"text":"It also suspends other test which have nothing to do with educational disparities and it also has other provisions with respect to enactment of new laws, sending to federal examiners, federal observers which have nothing to do with his educational disparities.","start":701.502,"stop":721.347,"duration":19.85},{"text":"Also, five-year period was in the end simply a legislative compromise.","start":721.347,"stop":728.534,"duration":7.19},{"text":"Congress seem not to have quite focus on what would happen into the five-year period.","start":728.534,"stop":734.059,"duration":5.52},{"text":"It's rather unthinkable for instance that having allowed thousands of illiterate Negro voters in the South to become registered thanks to this Federal Act, the Congress intended to permit that suddenly they should be purged from the rolls after five years had gone by.","start":734.059,"stop":750.756,"duration":16.7}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"I was going to ask you
