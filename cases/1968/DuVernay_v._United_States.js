been excluded from his Selective Service Board and in the midst of the trial of the case below, we discovered that the chairman of this black person's board was the president of the United Ku Klux

below.","start":114.865,"stop":134.367,"duration":19.5},{"text":"But I say to you that that can't possibly be because the boards below, the board in Louisiana, Board number 42 was perfectly

negroes were excluded from service on the board.","start":134.367,"stop":157.556,"duration":23.19},{"text":"These are constitutional issues which the board has no jurisdiction over and which could not

served.","start":324.561,"stop":352.943,"duration":28.38},{"text":"And they had an open clansman on the Board and they knew it but they didn't do anything about it until after this case when they got

this?","start":377.299,"stop":393.014,"duration":15.72},{"text":"They say, “Well, this is a -- this is like a malapportioned legislature.","start":393.014,"stop":397.353,"duration":4.34},{"text":"This is -- this is really not too bad, you know.”","start":397.353,"stop":400.776,"duration":3.42},{"text":"But actually, what they're saying and it would violate the separation of powers if we came in and

Court.","start":408.759,"stop":412.05,"duration":3.29},{"text":"But what I'm saying what they're saying is that the executive can be just as unconstitutional as he wants and he can get away with it.","start":412.05,"stop":419.475,"duration":7.43},{"text":"The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment applies to everybody but the
