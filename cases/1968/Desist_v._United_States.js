hard.","start":460.03,"stop":481.37,"duration":21.34},{"text":"And, I suddenly saw this, and I'd like to convey this to the Court.","start":481.37,"stop":485.966,"duration":4.6},{"text":"We don't

supplemental reply brief which I trust Your Honors have received.","start":511.455,"stop":519.894,"duration":8.44},{"text":"And, that brief is largely devoted to arguing that Katz did not make new law, but that Katz merely gave expression to preexisting Fourth Amendment law.","start":519.894,"stop":530.938,"duration":11.04},{"text":"If that analysis is correct, this analysis I've just offered,

making new law that requires a painful decision on retroactivity.","start":558.751,"stop":563.686,"duration":4.94},{"text":"We're simply applying the law as it existed.","start":563.686,"stop":567.323,"duration":3.64},{"text":"And, I will invite Your Honors to focus especially on a rereading of Katz.","start":567.323,"stop":573.933,"duration":6.61},{"text":"When you undertake your own deliberation and study on the case, read Katz closely please to see whether I'm not right that it's not a

law.","start":609.623,"stop":622.887,"duration":13.26},{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, in the Yutangco argument, as reported in the Criminal Law Reporter a few weeks ago, the Solicitor General said that

precedent?”","start":622.887,"stop":646.386,"duration":23.5},{"text":"I think it's one of those -- anyway, Your Honor was apparently suggesting to the Solicitor General there that Katz merely stated the -- what Katz says is what the law always was.","start":646.386,"stop":666.509,"duration":20.12},{"text":"Now, there are other reasons why we don't -- we, the petitioners, consider that we do not stand or fall, our fate does not depend upon the question of retroactivity or prospectivity of Katz.","start":666.509,"stop":686.328,"duration":19.82},{"text":"There is --there is a whole other half

Waldorf Astoria Hotel in December 1965, narcotic agents installed an electronic type of listening device in a room adjoining a room occupied by petitioner Nebbia.","start":702.826,"stop":717.381,"duration":14.55},{"text":"Then, over the next couple of days, the agents heard various things which were testified to at the trial and which if believed, were damaging.","start":717.381,"stop":728.422,"duration":11.04},{"text":"Now, the agents say that they put their bug in their own room rather than in Nebbia's room and that they didn't penetrate Nebbia's enclosure or close in anyway, that they laid the microphone, the listening device, at the bottom of the door of their own room where there was a small aperture.","start":728.422,"stop":756.325,"duration":27.9},{"text":"Then, beyond that door was an air space of a few inches and then a door Nebbia's room, the typical double door arrangement that you get in some of the better class hotels.","start":756.325,"stop":765.614,"duration":9.29},{"text":"The agents claim, in other words, a completely non-trespassory and non-physically intrusive type of
