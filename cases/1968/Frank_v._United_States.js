Ogden","textObjs":[{"text":"We're ready, Mr. Chief Justice and member of the Court.","start":11.521,"stop":15.827,"duration":4.31},{"text":"I think this case should take a very brief time because of the fact that the petitioner was charged with contempt of Court, convicted without a jury after a written demand and oral demand, and that really is about all there is to this case.","start":15.827,"stop":36.829,"duration":21},{"text":"He, likewise, as -- was unable, financially, to get this case or file a petitioned in this Court, and I -- if it’s not improper, I want to just thank the Court for being so generous to this man.","start":36.829,"stop":51.47,"duration":14.64},{"text":"It kind of makes you feel awfully good to see a man without a dime in the world to be able to appear before the highest Court in the country and have his rights determined, and I just say that very sincere and I’m doing what I did for nothing, too.","start":51.47,"stop":65.927,"duration":14.46},{"text":"So, I really don't have anything financially gained or lose.","start":65.927,"stop":70.749,"duration":4.82},{"text":"If I win or lose the case, it doesn't make any difference, but I just felt like it should be presented.","start":70.749,"stop":75.005,"duration":4.26},{"text":"Now, if the Court please, in this case, in 1952 in Oklahoma City, there was a default judgment rendered against Mr. Frank, enjoining him from, in effect, violating the Securities and Exchange Act.","start":75.005,"stop":89.89,"duration":14.89},{"text":"He is a man that, to get out and try to drill all wild terrain.","start":89.89,"stop":97.043,"duration":7.15},{"text":"He never made anything at it, but that -- in other words, it wasn't one of these cases where somebody go out and make a lot of money, leaving everybody sitting there.","start":97.043,"stop":105.693,"duration":8.65},{"text":"I don't think his -- I don't think he ever owned a car that's paid for, and I know he didn't own a home.","start":105.693,"stop":111.011,"duration":5.32},{"text":"He's just one of those kinds of people.","start":111.011,"stop":113.499,"duration":2.49},{"text":"Couldn't do much with him, I guess, so they just filed a suit against him instead of prosecuting him under the Securities and Exchange Act, and he didn't appear.","start":113.499,"stop":121.857,"duration":8.36},{"text":"They served a summons.","start":121.857,"stop":122.943,"duration":1.09},{"text":"They used a judgment against him.","start":122.943,"stop":124.886,"duration":1.94},{"text":"So then, after that, he just kept on.","start":124.886,"stop":127.045,"duration":2.16},{"text":"He didn't pay much attention to it, and so they filed and got an indictment against him.","start":127.045,"stop":135.039,"duration":7.99},{"text":"Then, I went up there and defended him in the Federal Court for three to four days.","start":135.039,"stop":138.481,"duration":3.44},{"text":"I don't know how long.","start":138.481,"stop":139.692,"duration":1.21},{"text":"The jury stayed out an hour -- I mean, almost over a day, but they convicted him and got 18 months on appeal at the Court of Appeals in Denver for the Tenth Circuit, and it was reversed.","start":139.692,"stop":150.235,"duration":10.54},{"text":"Then, after it was reversed, it came back.","start":150.235,"stop":153.385,"duration":3.15},{"text":"Why, Judge Volt, whose son at that time was my law partner, Judge Volt was a very kind person, an awfully nice person.","start":153.385,"stop":161.605,"duration":8.22},{"text":"He suggested this case face him.","start":161.605,"stop":163.526,"duration":1.92},{"text":"Almost cried.","start":163.526,"stop":164.896,"duration":1.37},{"text":"Just to let him enter a plea of no contention and get some kind of little sentence and that saved the government and everybody else a lot of time, and he finally did that case and disposed over that matter.","start":164.896,"stop":178.1,"duration":13.2},{"text":"Then, this case came along and I wasn't employed in it.","start":178.1,"stop":183.595,"duration":5.5},{"text":"Mr. Frank had moved to Tulsa, and that's where the acts actually occurred and, I presume, the person who wanted to be detective, that would've made him cry and Tulsa would've tried him in Oklahoma City.","start":183.595,"stop":194.198,"duration":10.6},{"text":"So, he had another law firm, I mean, a law firm.","start":194.198,"stop":197.409,"duration":3.21},{"text":"I'm just a one-man lawyer.","start":197.409,"stop":200.553,"duration":3.14},{"text":"But, he had a law firm represent him and they demanded and did an excellent job but, jury in, wrote it in writing and orally and every other way.","start":200.553,"stop":209.1,"duration":8.55},{"text":"And, when they presented it, the District Attorney said it was entitled to a jury and he was relying upon a Section of the statute which he read to the Court and, from this, Judge Bohanem, of the fact that he was entitled to a jury, just try him for this offense without a jury.","start":209.1,"stop":231.025,"duration":21.93},{"text":"The judge, however was not too much satisfied on that because he made a remark and it's -- if I might read it, I don't know if it'll make any difference, what remark he made but he did make a remark that he wasn't too satisfied about the question of whether he was entitled to a jury trial.","start":231.025,"stop":256.183,"duration":25.16},{"text":"And so, the judge said “Well, I'm quite concerned about the defendant's right for a jury trial.”","start":256.183,"stop":264.246,"duration":8.06},{"text":"Then, the District Attorney read Title 18, Section 3691 USCA, and from that, the first part of it -- of that section, would just -- there couldn't be any question about it, but the last part confused the judge apparently because the first part of that section, the Code says “Whenever a contempt charge shall consist the willful disobedience of the unlawful writ, process, or order, process or to rule a decree or command of any District Court of the United States by doing or omitting.","start":264.246,"stop":301.286,"duration":37.04},{"text":"Omitting any act or thing violation thereof and the act of thing having done were omitted also constitutes, I think this is important, this argument, if the Court please.","start":301.286,"stop":311.547,"duration":10.26},{"text":"Also constitutes a criminal offense under any act of current risk or the laws of any state in which the act was done or omitted the accused upon demand, therefore, shall be entitled to a trial by jury.","start":311.547,"stop":327.246,"duration":15.7},{"text":"Now, that's USCA.","start":327.246,"stop":329.826,"duration":2.58},{"text":"That's the code and that's the Section there.","start":329.826,"stop":332.149,"duration":2.32},{"text":"Now, then if we could just stop there, then nobody would've been confused and this case wouldn't have been here.","start":332.149,"stop":337.822,"duration":5.67},{"text":"But, the District Attorney argued and he claimed that, by virtue of this last part of that same section, that -- well, he wasn't entitled to a jury.","start":337.822,"stop":349.61,"duration":11.79},{"text":"Now, frankly, I don't know what that last part means, but I just would like to read for the reason that that is the reason of the trial judge, I think, denied him of a jury trial.","start":349.61,"stop":362.434,"duration":12.82},{"text":"This Section shall not apply to contempts committed in the presence of the Court.","start":362.434,"stop":367.86,"duration":5.43},{"text":"Well, of course, everybody knows that anyways.","start":367.86,"stop":369.718,"duration":1.86},{"text":"If you get open Court, you just go and use a language, something the judge wouldn't have to call the jury to try it when it's committed in his presence.","start":369.718,"stop":376.472,"duration":6.75},{"text":"Or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice.","start":376.472,"stop":380.62,"duration":4.15},{"text":"Now, here's the part “nor contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of or on behalf of the United States.”","start":380.62,"stop":399.818,"duration":19.2},{"text":"Now, that last part there is what caused the trial judge and cause this man to be denied trial by jury.","start":399.818,"stop":406.968,"duration":7.15},{"text":"So well-said that this was an act originally where the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Frank and got that judgment.","start":406.968,"stop":416.425,"duration":9.46},{"text":"That's what this charged with violating.","start":416.425,"stop":418.756,"duration":2.33},{"text":"Since he was charged with violating that Act, the trial judge thought that that was an order of the United States, which I guess it was because that is, of course, part of the United States Government, the Exchange Commission, and so -- but, regards to that, it's my contention and thought, I don't think it had application whatever to that, but it's my contention and thought that there wouldn't be any way to start out with if Congress would pass a law today and say “Well, you can try this man, give him as much as five years, but you -- he don't -- he's not entitled to the jury trial.”","start":418.756,"stop":460.044,"duration":41.29},{"text":"In other words, Congress couldn't take away a man's constitutional rights to a jury trial.","start":460.044,"stop":464.601,"duration":4.56},{"text":"If it tried to, I don't think that action does, but I can't find any construction of it and I can't tell you what it meant but -- I mean, what it's been construed to mean.","start":464.601,"stop":473.892,"duration":9.29},{"text":"But, in any rate and regards for all that, we all know that at least I do, that the Congress couldn't pass a law and say “Well, you're -- because, under the Sixth Amendment, it says “In all criminal offenses,.”","start":473.892,"stop":489.081,"duration":15.19},{"text":"Well, this is a criminal offense.","start":489.081,"stop":492.171,"duration":3.09},{"text":"And, if you'd pardon me for being personal, in 1937, I use to be State District Judge for 12 years in Ardmore and I held a man for contempt to Court that's cited in this opinion here by the Court of Appeals.","start":492.171,"stop":509.784,"duration":17.61},{"text":"I mean, I say it's cited just referred to but, in that case, the Court said that contempt was a criminal offense.","start":509.784,"stop":518.919,"duration":9.13},{"text":"Then, our Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma City, we don't appeal by regular Supreme Court.","start":518.919,"stop":524.563,"duration":5.64},{"text":"It's just how one Court for Criminal Appeals, one for Civil.","start":524.563,"stop":529.353,"duration":4.79},{"text":"Call the Court of Criminal Appeals.","start":529.353,"stop":531.3,"duration":1.95},{"text":"Well, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, ever since statehood has held consistently and every time that a man is entitled to a jury in any case where he's charged with violating any order of any Court, and then the Constitution of Oklahoma so provides, and then the Constitution of the United States, it would seem to me that the Constitution of the United States is just as clear in the Sixth Amendment been “in all,” it don't say “part of them.”","start":531.3,"stop":566.845,"duration":35.55},{"text":"Then, if you-- how do you classify this?","start":566.845,"stop":569.512,"duration":2.67},{"text":"Well, they want to classify it apparently, I say they and I mean the Solicitor General, they want to classify it as a petty offense.","start":569.512,"stop":576.61,"duration":7.1},{"text":"They will have to sp -- if you got three years, well, a petty offense is defined by the statute and it's Title 18, Article I, and it's defined and it says a petty offense cannot be more than $500 or six months in jail.","start":576.61,"stop":592.799,"duration":16.19},{"text":"Now, that's set out in my brief.","start":592.799,"stop":594.552,"duration":1.75},{"text":"It -- that's defined by the statute itself as a petty -- this can't be a petty offense.","start":594.552,"stop":599.753,"duration":5.2},{"text":"Then, that same Section also defines a felony, and it says that “any offense,” now this is that same Section that I just referred to defining a petty offense, also says that “now, we'll see what a felony is.”","start":599.753,"stop":616.499,"duration":16.75},{"text":"If a man can get that or if he can get more than one year, it's a felony under the Act of Congress.","start":616.499,"stop":623.198,"duration":6.7},{"text":"That's the same Section.","start":623.198,"stop":624.55,"duration":1.35}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
