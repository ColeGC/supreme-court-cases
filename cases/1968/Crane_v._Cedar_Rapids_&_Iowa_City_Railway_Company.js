great importance in the administration of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.","start":41.956,"stop":54.036,"duration":12.08},{"text":"The question is whether in a suit under that Act brought by a non-railroad employee, the railroad can assert the defense of contributory negligence, and everyone concedes that the petitioner in this case is covered by the Act.","start":54.036,"stop":73.126,"duration":19.09},{"text":"Everyone concedes that if this same suit were brought by a railroad employee, contributory negligence could not be asserted as a defense, even though all the facts were precisely the same and the violation of the Act was precisely the same as in the case of the non-railroad employee.","start":73.126,"stop":95.972,"duration":22.85},{"text":"Here, petitioner Ronald Crane was employed as a meal house helper by Cargill, Incorporated.","start":95.972,"stop":104.703,"duration":8.73},{"text":"His job was to spot, weigh and help load railroad cars which were delivered empty by the respondent railroad to Cargill, and after loading were picked up again by the respondent railroad for delivering in interstate commerce.","start":104.703,"stop":124.299,"duration":19.6},{"text":"The trial court properly instructed the jury and this Court can assume that for the purpose of this case, the railway cars on which plaintiff was working were being used by the defendant as part of its system?","start":124.299,"stop":141.733,"duration":17.43},{"text":"Now on the night of the accident, 1963, petitioner Crane and his co-worker Harris, were handling a string of six railroad cars.","start":141.733,"stop":152.989,"duration":11.26},{"text":"Harris detached or uncoupled the two most northerly cars in the string and moved them along the tracks for weighing by means of an electric winch and cable.","start":152.989,"stop":165.938,"duration":12.95},{"text":"When these cars were returned to the string, impact was made with the remaining four cars with sufficient force to move those cars some five feet, even though the brake was on them.","start":165.938,"stop":180.789,"duration":14.85},{"text":"Now at that point, the two cars clearly should've re-coupled automatically to the string of four cars.","start":180.789,"stop":188.594,"duration":7.81},{"text":"As this Court undoubtedly knows from prior cases, the Federal Safety Appliance Act as interpreted by this Court provides that railroad cars must be equipped with couplers which couple automatically by impact and when set in the proper position of course.","start":188.594,"stop":207.442,"duration":18.85},{"text":"And which will thereafter remain coupled until set free by some purposeful act of control.","start":207.442,"stop":214.878,"duration":7.44},{"text":"Now in this case, the knuckles were in proper position, and the cars collided with sufficient impact.","start":214.878,"stop":222.437,"duration":7.56},{"text":"Both Crane and Harris who looked at the mechanism thought and testified that the knuckles were closed and that the couplers appeared to be locked, but in fact they were not locked.","start":222.437,"stop":237.397,"duration":14.96},{"text":"Hours later, Harris began to move the entire string of cars forward by attaching the winch to the second car with Crane on the third car ready to put the brakes on, and the first two cars began to move out on their own, runaway cars uncoupled to the rest of the string.","start":237.397,"stop":260.707,"duration":23.31},{"text":"Crane thought that these runaway cars were going to ram into an empty car which he thought he'd seen down the tracks and which he thought men were working, and consequently he quickly put the brake on the third car, he jumped down, he ran along the tracks, he climbed up a ladder on the back of the second car, began to turn the brake to stop these two runaway cars and he fell to the tracks to a cement pavement.","start":260.707,"stop":283.173,"duration":22.47},{"text":"The bones in his feet were jammed up into his legs and he was permanently injured.","start":283.173,"stop":289.252,"duration":6.08},{"text":"Now before proceeding further, I want to say just a word about the statement of facts given by respondent.","start":289.252,"stop":295.099,"duration":5.85},{"text":"We've answered each of these statements with citations to the record in our reply brief, but the most direct answer to them is

jury.","start":295.099,"stop":311.802,"duration":16.7},{"text":"Once at the conclusion of our evidence, once at the conclusion of all the evidence, twice the trial judge rejected that version of the facts, twice the trial said this case can go to the jury.","start":311.802,"stop":322.613,"duration":10.81},{"text":"And consequently we submit that the respondent railroad is not free again here to reargue these facts which properly for the -- or for the jury and which went to the jury.","start":322.613,"stop":334.318,"duration":11.7},{"text":"Crane brought his case in an Iowa State Court alleging violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act and that the railroad had provided cars with defective couplers.","start":334.318,"stop":347.621,"duration":13.3},{"text":"From the outset of this case, Crane argued that contributory negligence was not a defense, was not a defense where there was a violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.","start":347.621,"stop":359.876,"duration":12.25},{"text":"That liability was absolute once a violation was shown to be approximate cause of his injury.","start":359.876,"stop":367.683,"duration":7.81},{"text":"The railroad argued otherwise.","start":367.683,"stop":369.612,"duration":1.93},{"text":"And the trial judge adopted the railroads argument and allowed the defense of contributory negligence to go to the jury and as a matter of fact put the burden on Crane to prove absence of contributory negligence rather than on the railroad to

apply.","start":557.571,"stop":575.029,"duration":17.46},{"text":"And in those early cases under both FELA and the Safety Act, liability in those days was thought off in traditional negligence

applicable.","start":586.482,"stop":606.169,"duration":19.69},{"text":"But beginning in the late 1930's a change began to take place in the reading of the Safety

commerce.","start":615.83,"stop":623.831,"duration":8},{"text":"The court in the late 1930's, sensing that the restrictions which the state courts were placing on recovery in these cases was not the will of Congress, began requiring stricter standards of liability by the railroads for violating the Safety Act.","start":623.831,"stop":642.431,"duration":18.6},{"text":"The court finally said that liability under the Act had nothing whatever to do with negligence, negligence was completely out of the matter, and that the railroad owed an absolute duty to those properly upon its lines to maintain its equipment in efficient condition.","start":642.431,"stop":659.929,"duration":17.5},{"text":"And then in due course, the court came to the terms absolute liability, and absolute prohibition in interpreting the Safety Act.","start":659.929,"stop":672.028,"duration":12.1},{"text":"Now the use of these terms could hardly have been inadvertent or imprecise as suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court.","start":672.028,"stop":680.189,"duration":8.16},{"text":"The Shields case for example, involved the employee of an independent contractor and therefore it had nothing to do with FELA, it was not brought under FELA at all.","start":680.189,"stop":689.695,"duration":9.51},{"text":"Contributory negligence was specifically pleaded as a defense in that case.","start":689.695,"stop":695.062,"duration":5.37},{"text":"The trial court instructed the contributory negligence was not a defense.","start":695.062,"stop":701.033,"duration":5.97},{"text":"The railroad made this a point on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.","start":701.033,"stop":705.303,"duration":4.27},{"text":"The Fifth Circuit specifically said that the plaintiff was invoking absolute liability.","start":705.303,"stop":711.344,"duration":6.04},{"text":"This Court in its opinion mentioned that plaintiff was invoking absolute liability, and then it went on to say that violation of the Act did result in absolute liability.","start":711.344,"stop":724.181,"duration":12.84},{"text":"Now in the light of the record in the case like that to say that this Court had merely used the term absolute viability loosely or inadvertently of course we say simply makes no sense.","start":724.181,"stop":738.156,"duration":13.97},{"text":"What we're asking here is that this Safety Act be interpreted in the light of the overall intent of Congress, which was to impose on the railroads whatever liability was necessary to make them maintain their equipment in proper condition.","start":738.156,"stop":756.017,"duration":17.86},{"text":"And yet look what happens now if the court adapts the reasoning of the respondent in this case?","start":756.017,"stop":765.254,"duration":9.24},{"text":"The railroad is able to turn over a car, a defective car, to an independent third party such as Cargill.","start":765.254,"stop":777.119,"duration":11.87},{"text":"The railroad knows that it's not going to receive that car back on its tracks for a period of time.","start":777.119,"stop":784.046,"duration":6.93},{"text":"Now if contributory negligence can be asserted by an employee of that third party, it's very much to the advantage of the railroad to leave that car defective, leave it defective, wait till it gets back on its lines because if the injury occurs in the interim, they're going to have a lot easier time of it.","start":784.046,"stop":801.58,"duration":17.53},{"text":"How could that possibly have been the intent of Congress?","start":801.58,"stop":804.586,"duration":3.01},{"text":"Congress' intent must have been to require the railroad to fix this equipment at the earliest possible time and to impose whatever liability that required them to do it.","start":804.586,"stop":815.68,"duration":11.09},{"text":"And look what other results followed here.","start":815.68,"stop":819.043,"duration":3.36},{"text":"In this case, the trial court not only placed the burden upon Mr. Crane to prove by a preponderance or a greater weight of the evidence that he was not guilty of contributory negligence, but listen to this.","start":819.043,"stop":834.965,"duration":15.92},{"text":"It instructed that if his contributory negligence contributed in any way or in any degree directly to the injury, he could not recover at all.","start":834.965,"stop":848.749,"duration":13.78},{"text":"Now, what happens?","start":848.749,"stop":850.875,"duration":2.13},{"text":"Mr. Crane thus winds up with less chance of recovery even though the railroad violated the Safety Act then if one of the railroad's own employees had been injured and the railroad had been guilty only of simple negligence, not even of a violation of the Safety Act because in that case, the employee could recover diminished damages but at least damages of some kind whereas in -- in this case, the employee of the third party can't recover at all.","start":850.875,"stop":885.14,"duration":34.26},{"text":"And we just submit that that could not possibly have been the intent of Congress.","start":885.14,"stop":889.378,"duration":4.24},{"text":"That the intent was entirely the other way, because if it's one thing these two Act show if they're read together it's that Congress was concerned primarily about violations of the Safety Act.","start":889.378,"stop":901.934,"duration":12.56},{"text":"That's what it was concerned about if you compare the statutes every time the Safety Act is mentioned.","start":901.934,"stop":908.359,"duration":6.43},{"text":"Liability grows greater, the standards become stricter.","start":908.359,"stop":911.376,"duration":3.02},{"text":"That's what they were concerned about, the thousands of deaths and injuries that were occurring because equipment was improper.","start":911.376,"stop":921.367,"duration":9.99},{"text":"Now the type of interpretation that we seek here is certainly nothing new to the statute.","start":921.367,"stop":927.335,"duration":5.97},{"text":"Time and again this Court has read the literal language of the Act in the light of the overall writing intent of Congress.","start":927.335,"stop":935.716,"duration":8.38},{"text":"In once case for example, although the Act only refers to couplers coupling automatically by impact and uncoupling without the necessity of going between cars, this Court required in addition that the couplers remained coupled until set free by some purposeful act of control.","start":935.716,"stop":955.705,"duration":19.99},{"text":"That wasn't in the statute, but this Court added it because it thought that that was the plain meaning of Congress in passing the statute.","start":955.705,"stop":964.633,"duration":8.93},{"text":"In another case, the court struck the fellow servant defense from Safety Act cases, even though the Act itself made no reference whatever to the fellow servant rule, and the Court said the obvious purpose of the legislature was to supplant the qualified duty of the common law with an absolute duty deemed by it nor just.","start":964.633,"stop":988.853,"duration":24.22},{"text":"In still another case, it was argued that the Safety Act made clear by its various provisions that it applied only to railroad workers.","start":988.853,"stop":998.386,"duration":9.53},{"text":"And this Court held it applicable to motorist on the highway as well who came across the tracks and any one else as a matter fact who were properly on the railroads properly.","start":998.386,"stop":1009.011,"duration":10.63},{"text":"And still again the court ruled that assumption of risk was just as applicable to employees of a connecting carrier as it was to the defendant railroad, even though the assumption of risk provision would seem to have been applicable only to employees of the guilty carrier.","start":1009.011,"stop":1024.387,"duration":15.38},{"text":"And in that case, it's interesting that the Court relied on both FELA and the Safety Act even though the case was brought only under the Safety Act.","start":1024.387,"stop":1035.673,"duration":11.29},{"text":"Now this brings me to the point that has been emphasized by the court so strongly many times, and that is that the Safety Act and FELA are really correlative, interdependent, interrelated statutes, each gain sustenance from the other, each must be read in the light of the other and we say that the specific abolition of the defense of contributory negligence in FELA permeates the entire Safety Act.","start":1035.673,"stop":1069.412,"duration":33.74},{"text":"In other words, so long as the injured party is one who is covered by the Safety Act, which is clearly the case, concededly the case here, the railroad should not be able to use contributory negligence to defeat him any more that it can now use assumption of risk to defeat him or the fellow servant doctrine to defeat him.","start":1069.412,"stop":1090.51,"duration":21.1}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Well let's see, Mr.
