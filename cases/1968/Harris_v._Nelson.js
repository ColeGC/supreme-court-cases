Stanley Pottinger","textObjs":[{"text":"No, there is no indication whatsoever.","start":296.211,"stop":298.12,"duration":1.91},{"text":"All that we can surmise from the record is that the interrogatories were initially propounded pursuant to federal rules.","start":298.12,"stop":305.994,"duration":7.87},{"text":"However, at the argument on this matter, the Court did not make a ruling on the federal rules.","start":305.994,"stop":312.345,"duration":6.35},{"text":"The Court did take the matter under submission rather than ruling from the bench, and when the order of the Court was entered, it deleted any reference to the federal rules.","start":312.345,"stop":321.406,"duration":9.06},{"text":"The order simply states that interrogatories are to be answered, and it did not say pursuant to the federal rules or pursuant to inherent power.","start":321.406,"stop":330.578,"duration":9.17},{"text":"We believe, of course, that, therefore, the rule -- the ruling of the Court is sustainable on any valid ground and my understanding of the jurisdiction of a writ of prohibition is that it can only issue if there is no jurisdiction whatsoever to sustain the order in question.","start":330.578,"stop":349.472,"duration":18.89},{"text":"We believe that there are two interpretations that Rule 81 (a) (2) will support.","start":349.472,"stop":359.008,"duration":9.54},{"text":"One is the interpretation given by the Ninth Circuit and which is urged upon this Court by respondent.","start":359.008,"stop":365.982,"duration":6.97},{"text":"And, the second is a broader interpretation which is urged upon the Court by petitioner.","start":365.982,"stop":372.772,"duration":6.79},{"text":"Rule 81 (a) (2) provides that there is no doubt that some of the rules of federal procedure are applicable to habeas corpus, but it provides that only those rules will be applicable to the extent that the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United States and, secondly, that the practice is here to for -- conform to the practice in civil actions.","start":372.772,"stop":396.345,"duration":23.57},{"text":"The first requirement is not an objection that we concede in this case because there are no statutes governing the practice presently before the Court.","start":396.345,"stop":409.269,"duration":12.92},{"text":"It is -- and, indeed, the Ninth Circuit did not have a problem with this first requirement.","start":409.269,"stop":414.057,"duration":4.79},{"text":"It is the second requirement that is in issue.","start":414.057,"stop":417.466,"duration":3.41},{"text":"Under the Ninth Circuit's interpretation, the Court has read the rule here to require a showing that there is an actual use of the specific procedure, in this case a discovery interrogatory in civil actions prior to 1938.","start":417.466,"stop":435.133,"duration":17.67},{"text":"And, that the exact same procedure was reported and used in habeas corpus proceedings prior to 1938 and in that event, and only in that event, says the Ninth Circuit, can rules -- appropriate rules be applied today.","start":435.133,"stop":450.644,"duration":15.51},{"text":"We believe that there is no reason to read the rules so restrictively.","start":450.644,"stop":456.249,"duration":5.61},{"text":"Indeed, the language does not necessarily dictate this interpretation, nor does the statutory history which actually is very unelucidating on the entire question, but it does not dictate this interpretation either.","start":456.249,"stop":471.237,"duration":14.99},{"text":"The language of the statute, frankly, doesn't make sense under this interpretation because the result is to make only those rules or only those procedures applicable which were already applicable prior to 1938.","start":471.237,"stop":486.382,"duration":15.14},{"text":"In that extent -- to that extent, of course, that procedure would continue on anyway after the promulgation of the federal rules, or the alternative under this narrow interpretation is to make no rules applicable.","start":486.382,"stop":501.415,"duration":15.03},{"text":"In which case, there was no reason for the provision to be placed in the federal rules in the first place.","start":501.415,"stop":506.592,"duration":5.18},{"text":"So, even on its face, this particular interpretation does not make sense.","start":506.592,"stop":511.569,"duration":4.98},{"text":"But, a more important reason for rejecting the interpretation is the result that would flow from this interpretation.","start":511.569,"stop":518.751,"duration":7.18},{"text":"The result would be to freeze all procedures which are available in habeas corpus to those procedures available in the year 1938, and the entire history of the writ of habeas corpus has been one of growth, of flexibility, of permitting the Courts to meet the expanded needs of the writ itself and, certainly, those needs have greatly expanded under the issues of this Court, under the habeas corpus statutory scheme provided by Congress.","start":518.751,"stop":547.732,"duration":28.98},{"text":"And, we believe it would be an intolerable restraint upon the District Courts to be restricted simply to those narrow and rather formalistic procedures available in the year 1938.","start":547.732,"stop":557.677,"duration":9.95},{"text":"Under our interpretation of Rule 81 (a) (2), we read the statute to require only a showing that there was a practice in habeas corpus conforming to a practice in civil actions in a more general sense.","start":557.677,"stop":573.603,"duration":15.93},{"text":"We mean to read it -- we read it to say that if there was a general format applicable on habeas corpus similar to the general format in civil proceedings, then those rules which are suitable to or which facilitate that general form that are available today under the rules.","start":573.603,"stop":590.892,"duration":17.29},{"text":"In other words, the general format that did apply to habeas corpus prior to 1938 and to civil proceedings prior to 1938 was the development and trial of issues of fact by a Court.","start":590.892,"stop":604.209,"duration":13.32},{"text":"Those two practices were identical or did exist in both civil and habeas proceedings and we feel that, to that extent, rules -- in the federal rules of civil procedure which facilitate that practice should be available.","start":604.209,"stop":617.998,"duration":13.79},{"text":"This, of course, would exclude, for instance, rules in ci -- civil rules governing trials by jury, since there never was a trial by jury in habeas proceedings and there should not be such a trial today, but those rules which are suitable, we believe, are supported by the statute and sound policy dictates their use today.","start":617.998,"stop":640.852,"duration":22.85},{"text":"For the same reasons, the offers of the restrictive practice that I've mentioned on the part of the Ninth Circuit, the expanded duties under the habeas corpus decisions of this Court would require the Court to utilize appropriate rules to that end.","start":640.852,"stop":657.292,"duration":16.44},{"text":"And, indeed, we point out in our brief that this is the -- the vast majority of Courts in this country who have utilized rules in habeas corpus have indeed adopted this interpretation and no fewer than six circuits in this country, over a period of 20 years, have adopted various rules of the federal rules of civil procedure appropriate to the task before them.","start":657.292,"stop":683.185,"duration":25.89},{"text":"Five circuits of which, have adopted discovery rules.","start":683.185,"stop":688.713,"duration":5.53},{"text":"All of the discovery rules of civil procedure have been used in habeas proceedings and reported other than, I believe it is, request for admissions.","start":688.713,"stop":699.188,"duration":10.48},{"text":"I don't believe we've found a case on that particular proceeding, but all other rules have been used, including Rule
