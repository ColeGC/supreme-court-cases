conclusory fashion that he had been beaten and assaulted and tortured in various respects.","start":245.403,"stop":258.831,"duration":13.43},{"text":"Petitioners Willingham and Jarvis filed a general denial in the State Court denying all the allegations in the 10-count complaint that had been filed by respondent.","start":258.831,"stop":273.185,"duration":14.35},{"text":"They also filed, pursuant

Kansas.","start":273.185,"stop":290.447,"duration":17.26},{"text":"In this removal petition, they asserted that, at all relevant times, they had been acting in their official capacities as Warden and Chief Medical Officer of Leavenworth Penitentiary and they set out the various counts of the complaint and then, at page 9 of the record, they said that Morgan is, and was at all times mentioned, a dully committed prisoner inmate of the Federal Penitentiary at Leavenworth and rather that any act or thing that these petitioners, or either of them, may have done or authorized to be done concerning Morgan, complained of by him, was done and made by them in the course of their duties as officers of the United States of America and as persons acting under officers of the United States of America and under color of such office and by virtue thereof.","start":290.447,"stop":351.578,"duration":61.13},{"text":"And, they again refer to their officers as the Warden and Chief Medical Officer.","start":351.578,"stop":358.632,"duration":7.05},{"text":"Morgan then filed a motion in the Federal District Court to remand the case back to the State Court.","start":358.632,"stop":368.369,"duration":9.74},{"text":"He asserted for a variety of respects that petitioners were not acting under color of office when they committed the acts he alleged they had committed.","start":368.369,"stop":381.35,"duration":12.98},{"text":"He also filed a rather extensive set of interrogatories on petitioner Willingham, directed in substantial part obtaining the names of the unnamed unidentified co-defendants.","start":381.35,"stop":398.661,"duration":17.31},{"text":"With the District Court's approval, an enlargement of time to answer these interrogatories was obtained.","start":398.661,"stop":407.505,"duration":8.84},{"text":"The next step was petitioners filing for a summary judgment in the Federal District Court on the ground that Morgan's suit should be dismissed under the so-called Official Immunity Doctrine which has been established by this Court as relating to executive officials as well as judicial and legislative officials in cases dating back to Spalding versus Vilas and going through Barr versus Matteo.","start":407.505,"stop":443.13,"duration":35.63},{"text":"Petitioners, at that point, filed failry

and Chief Medical Officer at Leavenworth and stated that the only contact that they had had with respondent Morgan was within the prison walls at Leavenworth and was in the course of their official duties as Warden and Chief Medical Officer.","start":460.783,"stop":482.116,"duration":21.33},{"text":"Respondent Morgan opposed dismissal on a variety of grounds.","start":482.116,"stop":487.555,"duration":5.44},{"text":"The District Court in August of 1966 denied the motion of respondent Morgan to remand the suit to the State Court, finding that removal was proper under Section 1442 (a) (1) and writing a short opinion in that regard.","start":487.555,"stop":511.316,"duration":23.76},{"text":"Subsequently, in December of 1966, the District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the suit.","start":511.316,"stop":523.679,"duration":12.36},{"text":"In substance, the basis for the dismissal was the District Court's determination that the suit was covered by the Official Immunity Doctrine and that not only had it been properly removed, but that it was subject to dismissal.","start":523.679,"stop":539.629,"duration":15.95},{"text":"Respondent Morgan then appealed to the Tenth Circuit from this judgment, and both parties frankly thought that the issue before the Tenth Circuit related to whether the District Court had properly determined that the requisite -- prerequisites for the Official Immunity Doctrine had been met and the case was briefed and submitted on the brief to the Court on that basis.","start":539.629,"stop":568.652,"duration":29.02},{"text":"However, in deciding the case, the Tenth Circuit found it unnecessary to reach the question of whether the Official Immunity defense was properly invoked here.","start":568.652,"stop":581.476,"duration":12.82},{"text":"Instead, it, although it started out by saying and spent most of its opinion by discussing the nature of interrelationship between the Official Immunity standard and the so-called color of office test for removal, it concluded that the District Court had erred in finding that the suit had been properly removed.","start":581.476,"stop":605.461,"duration":23.99},{"text":"It said that “the color of office test for removal was much narrower,” and that's a quote from the Court of Appeals opinion, than the standard of Official Immunity and, therefore, it determined that the District Court did not have an adequate basis on which -- on the record that existed, on which to determine that removal was proper and it reversed the District Court's decision not reaching the Official immunity question and remanded for a factual determination, in its words, of the question whether removal was proper.","start":605.461,"stop":648.498,"duration":43.04}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What was the issue that opened on
