company.","start":805.619,"stop":830.67,"duration":25.05},{"text":"It is really a test about what kind of entity in the foreign milieu we have to recognize as a company, and the reason why this article was drafted in these terms was that previously, previously in the U.S. Treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with Germany, for example, or with Japan, the Treaties in the 19 teens
