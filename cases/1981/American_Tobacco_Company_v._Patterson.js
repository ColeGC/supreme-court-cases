that 703(h) of Title 7 did not apply to seniority systems established or revised after the effective date of the Act.","start":94.509,"stop":114.82,"duration":20.31},{"text":"In other words, the issue is, as a practical matter, whether post Act seniority systems must be analyzed under the impact test of Griggs with the defense of business necessity, or should it be analyzed under 703(h), which provides for intent.","start":114.82,"stop":144.942,"duration":30.12},{"text":"If the Fourth Circuit is right, seniority systems are no longer provided with the special treatment that the Congress very clearly gave them in enacting 703(h) of Title 7.","start":144.942,"stop":167.955,"duration":23.01},{"text":"Our position simply is that the plain language of 703(h), its legislative history, the

Act.","start":167.955,"stop":195.874,"duration":27.92},{"text":"The particular seniority system at issue here are lines of progression that are in effect at two plants in Richmond, Virginia, one a

case.","start":335.798,"stop":338.4,"duration":2.6},{"text":"On remand, during back pay proceedings, this Court handed down its decision in Teamsters, which, as we all know, really dramatically

the Fourth Circuit's holding is plainly wrong, when we read the language of the statute and the legislative history which all point to the fact that all seniority systems are to be given special treatment, two memorandums to the contrary, one being the Justice Department memorandum and another the case memorandum, which were both published to answer the specific question of whether or not vested seniority rights would be denied under Title 7, and those two memorandums answered the question presented and nothing more, and said that existing seniority rights, of course, would not be affected.","start":506.354,"stop":573.933,"duration":67.58},{"text":"All the other legislative history, including statements by Senator Humphrey, Senator Williams, other questions submitted by Senator Dirksen all point to the fact that all seniority systems are to be included within the cloak of 703(h).","start":573.933,"stop":600.983,"duration":27.05},{"text":"To hold otherwise really does away

bill were under constant attack, and they were under particular attack in the area that this Court must now address, and that is to what extent were the beneficial provisions of Title 7 to deal with the difficult questions of seniority that were repeatedly used as a method for challenging the passage of Title 7 by its opponents who acted vigorously indeed.","start":861.103,"stop":895.257,"duration":34.15},{"text":"And thus, the proponents of the bill, considering the charge that this bill would attack seniority, that this bill would affect seniority rights, were called upon repeatedly to lay to rest what they considered to be a canard, that the bill would affect seniority rights.","start":895.257,"stop":916.853,"duration":21.6},{"text":"And ultimately, as that debate continued, not only did the various proponents of the bill speak broadly and without qualification that the bill would not affect seniority rights at all, ultimately they found it necessary in order to obtain final passage of this critical bill to add to the statute Section 703(h), which confirmed as a part of the actual statute rather than its legislative history the acknowledgement that they had made that seniority, the seniority principle was a preferred value that was to be maintained so long as seniority was not used as a subterfuge, compressed within the phrase, the provision that ultimately became 703(h), the phrase \"bona fide\" and the provision that there is to be... seniority systems would be protected if they were bona fide, and not themselves a demonstration of intentional discrimination.","start":916.853,"stop":983.062,"duration":66.21},{"text":"The Congress had compressed in
