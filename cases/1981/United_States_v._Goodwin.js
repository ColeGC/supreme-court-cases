that the increased charges could not have been brought in the first instance.","start":304.53,"stop":316.67,"duration":12.14},{"text":"Now, before turning to my argument I'd like to make a couple of preliminary observations about the case.","start":316.67,"stop":322.991,"duration":6.32},{"text":"The first is, I think the Court should appreciate the sweeping effect of the Fourth Circuit's rule, because the rule is really tantamount to saying that in all but a very small proportion of cases the initial charge that's brought by the prosecutor cannot be increased.","start":322.991,"stop":340.786,"duration":17.8},{"text":"All that's necessary to trigger the appearance of vindictiveness and the almost irrebuttable presumption of a due process violation under the Fourth Circuit's holding is the exercise of a right by the Defendant.","start":340.786,"stop":353.795,"duration":13.01},{"text":"And in a criminal case rights start being exercised fast and furious shortly after the initial filing of the initial charges.","start":353.795,"stop":362.818,"duration":9.02},{"text":"And the kind of explanation that the Fourth Circuit would accept to rebut the appearance of vindictiveness and to show that there was no retaliatory motive is strictly limited to what would be an extremely small class of cases.","start":362.818,"stop":378.411,"duration":15.59},{"text":"Now, the second point I wanted to make preliminarily is that the purpose of the vindictive prosecution due process prohibition is not to protect generally against unjustified charging decisions.","start":378.411,"stop":394.437,"duration":16.03},{"text":"The protection against abuse of the prosecutor's discretion generally in charging decisions is the grand jury and the trial and the judicial procedures incident thereto, as well as the political pressures and the supervision within the executive branch over the prosecutor's conduct.","start":394.437,"stop":413.334,"duration":18.9},{"text":"The purpose of the vindictive prosecution doctrine is specifically to protect against a vindictive retaliation for the exercise of a right by the defendant.","start":413.334,"stop":424.273,"duration":10.94},{"text":"Now, here it's important to note that the Court of Appeals readily concluded, in their words, that there was no actual vindictiveness on the part of the prosecutor in this case, and Respondent has never alleged to the contrary.","start":424.273,"stop":439.901,"duration":15.63},{"text":"In fact, it's absolutely clear on the facts of this case that the jury demand was wholly irrelevant to the prosecutor's decision to increase the charges.","start":439.901,"stop":448.924,"duration":9.02}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Frey, would you concede that in a case when there is actual vindictiveness involved that

Frey","textObjs":[{"text":"--Yes.","start":503.475,"stop":504.042,"duration":0.57},{"text":"But I think it's an important part of our argument that the circumstances in which there might be a proper showing to require such an inquiry are quite limited.","start":504.042,"stop":513.664,"duration":9.62}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"--Yes.","start":513.664,"stop":514.732,"duration":1.07},{"text":"Would you concede it for purposes of a pretrial situation?","start":514.732,"stop":517.234,"duration":2.5}]},{"speakerName":"Mr. Andrew L. Frey","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, our argument with regard to the pretrial situation us essentially that there should be no presumption of vindictiveness, that what the Court of Appeals did here and what the courts of appeals have been doing in what we think is a misinterpretation of Pearce and Perry is to equate the mere exercise of a right followed by an increase in charges with a presumed vindictiveness on the part of the Government.","start":517.234,"stop":546.552,"duration":29.32},{"text":"And we do not believe that has any place in the analysis of these cases.","start":546.552,"stop":553.657,"duration":7.11},{"text":"I think we are not prepared to say, and we certainly don't need to for purposes of this case, to go as far as Judge Meritt went in the Andrews case and say that it's perfectly all right for the prosecutor to be vindictive in the pretrial context.","start":553.657,"stop":566.381,"duration":12.72},{"text":"We're not urging that upon the Court in this case.","start":566.381,"stop":568.667,"duration":2.29}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"You're not urging the application of a per se rule either way, in other words?","start":568.667,"stop":574.237,"duration":5.57}]},{"speakerName":"Mr. Andrew L. Frey","textObjs":[{"text":"We are not.","start":574.237,"stop":576.004,"duration":1.77},{"text":"Let me just explain how I view the structure of the issues and perhaps our position will become clearer.","start":576.004,"stop":582.677,"duration":6.67},{"text":"It seems to me that every due process vindictiveness claim essentially presents two questions.","start":582.677,"stop":588.312,"duration":5.63},{"text":"The first part... the first question is whether the defendant who is making the claim has shown enough to make out a prime facie case of a due process violation and to shift to the prosecutor the burden of explaining his actions.","start":588.312,"stop":604.506,"duration":16.19},{"text":"Of course, if not enough has been shown, then that's the end of the matter and the motion should be denied.","start":604.506,"stop":609.66,"duration":5.15},{"text":"The second question, if enough has been shown to call for an explanation by the prosecutor, is what kinds of explanations should be deemed acceptable to rebut such a prima facie case.","start":609.66,"stop":619.933,"duration":10.27},{"text":"Now, here the question is whether the Respondent, by simply showing that he demanded a jury trial and that at some time subsequent to that demand more severe charges were returned, did enough to make out a prima facie case of vindictive prosecution.","start":619.933,"stop":637.994,"duration":18.06},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, importing the principles of Pearce and Perry to the pretrial context, has held that those facts suffice to create a presumption if vindictiveness, in effect.","start":637.994,"stop":652.087,"duration":14.09},{"text":"We say that in the pretrial context there should instead be a presumption of regularity in the prosecutor's action and that the burden should be on the Defendant to show concrete and specific facts from which a conclusion of actual vindictiveness on the part of the prosecutor can be drawn.","start":652.087,"stop":672.901,"duration":20.81},{"text":"Now, this presumption of regulatory in prosecutorial charging decisions is the rule in every other context of which I am aware.","start":672.901,"stop":681.756,"duration":8.86},{"text":"This is the only exception.","start":681.756,"stop":683.458,"duration":1.7},{"text":"And I'd like to call to the Court's attention the treatment of selective prosecution claims.","start":683.458,"stop":689.862,"duration":6.4},{"text":"These claims are quite analogous, it seems to me, to vindictive prosecution claims.","start":689.862,"stop":694.933,"duration":5.07},{"text":"Surely the bringing of a prosecution on account of a person's race or political views or religion is every bit as invidious a practice as bringing a prosecution to retaliate against the exercise of a right.","start":694.933,"stop":710.026,"duration":15.09},{"text":"Equally, the possibility of an invidiously discriminatory motive underlying a prosecution is present in virtually every case.","start":710.026,"stop":719.965,"duration":9.94},{"text":"Yet, it has never been thought, and I think it's quite clear, that those things combined are not enough to make out a prima facie case and to require the prosecutor to come in and explain his reasons for his actions, let alone rigidly restricting the reasons for his actions to practically nothing that can justify it.","start":719.965,"stop":739.129,"duration":19.16},{"text":"Now, in Pearce and Perry the Court confronted cases in which vindictiveness appeared to be the most likely explanation for the increased penalty exposure of the defendants, and indeed cases in which no non-vindictive explanation was ever tendered.","start":739.129,"stop":757.84,"duration":18.71},{"text":"In fact in the Rice case, which was the companion of Pearce, the district court found actual vindictive retaliation against the appeal, and in Pearce... in the Pearce case the Court described the state's assertion as nothing more than the naked power to do what it did.","start":757.84,"stop":777.504,"duration":19.66},{"text":"Now, in the pretrial context we submit that the circumstances are entirely different, and this difference consists principally of two elements: The first element is that the exercise of rights by defendants in pretrial contexts is an entirely commonplace event.","start":777.504,"stop":797.548,"duration":20.04},{"text":"It is not likely to provoke a vindictive or retaliatory response by the prosecutor that the defendant has pleaded not guilty, that he's asked for a jury trial, that he's moved to suppress evidence, that he sought a continuance or asked for a severance or a change of venue.","start":797.548,"stop":812.475,"duration":14.93},{"text":"These are everyday occurrences, everyday grist to the prosecutor's mill, and to presume that the prosecutor would react in an unprofessional and unfair manner by retaliating against that kind of occurrence is simply contrary to common sense.","start":812.475,"stop":829.12,"duration":16.64},{"text":"In fact, I submit that the prosecutor generally would be astounded if a defendant exercised no rights in the pretrial context.","start":829.12,"stop":837.459,"duration":8.34},{"text":"Now, not only is the exercise of a right by a defendant in the pretrial context therefore not a likely occasion for a retaliatory response by the prosecutor, but equally the process of preparation for the trial itself will inevitably give the prosecutor a better grasp of the facts of the case and can be expected in some cases to reveal reasons for concluding that the initial charges were too lenient.","start":837.459,"stop":864.36,"duration":26.9},{"text":"So that this is again a context in which it is not unlikely.","start":864.36,"stop":868.395,"duration":4.03},{"text":"Superseding indictments are common.","start":868.395,"stop":870.347,"duration":1.95},{"text":"Sometimes the initial severity of charges is reduced because the prosecutor concludes in his pretrial preparation that they were too severe.","start":870.347,"stop":879.369,"duration":9.02},{"text":"Sometimes the severity is increased because he concludes that it was too lenient.","start":879.369,"stop":883.254,"duration":3.88}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Frey, can I interrupt you just a second.","start":883.254,"stop":885.023,"duration":1.77},{"text":"In this particular case, where the argument is made that the increased charges were in response to the jury demand, do you think the
