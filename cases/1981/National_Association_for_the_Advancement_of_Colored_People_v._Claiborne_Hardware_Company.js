was enough to make all active boycott participants liable at common law for all the business losses suffered by the merchants.","start":367.351,"stop":390.116,"duration":22.76},{"text":"Before I turn to those 12 incidents, I would like to outline our basic legal position in three simple points.","start":390.116,"stop":398.472,"duration":8.36},{"text":"The first is that this nation was born out of a series of colonial boycotts against British merchants in support of petitions to the British king and Parliament for the redress of grievances.","start":398.472,"stop":412.28,"duration":13.81},{"text":"The need to organize and enforce these boycotts led to the First Continental Congress, and provided the cohesion that ultimately enabled the American colonies to win their independence.","start":412.28,"stop":426.354,"duration":14.07},{"text":"These boycotts were enforced by many of the same methods of surveillance, denunciation, and ostracism used in Claiborne County, and occasionally there were episodes of violence, such as the Boston Tea Party.","start":426.354,"stop":442.632,"duration":16.28},{"text":"Thomas Jefferson, John Dickinson, and other leaders of the colonial boycotts regarded them as lawful methods of petition for the redress of grievances, while conceding that the perpetrators of unlawful acts, like the Boston Tea Party, should be held answerable for their conduct, and we maintain that this boycott was a lawful method of petition, while conceding that if any Petitioner were found to have committed or to have threatened to commit an act of violence to enforce the boycott, that Petitioner would be answerable for the proven consequences of his act.","start":442.632,"stop":485.126,"duration":42.49},{"text":"My second point is that if some acts of violence are interspersed among other peaceful acts, such as meetings, parades, speeches, and even such measures of non-violent enforcement as surveillance, denunciation, and ostracism, as was true of the enforced colonial boycotts, and we submit it is the most that was true in Claiborne County, then only those found to have committed the violent acts may constitutionally be held liable for anything, and that even they may be held only for that portion of the merchant's business losses that is reasonably attributable to those violent acts.","start":485.126,"stop":533.975,"duration":48.85},{"text":"While I suppose one could hypothesize a boycott in which no customer would have withheld his patronage, but for the violent acts of the organizers, as Justice Brennan hypothesized in the Gibbs case, so that those who committed these acts would be liable for all the business losses of the merchants, that hypothesis, we say, is very far from the facts of this case, and in the Mississippi Supreme Court, the Respondents conceded that \"most of the witnesses\" that they themselves had called to testify had said","start":533.975,"stop":576.135,"duration":42.16},{"text":"\"they voluntarily went along with the NAACP and their fellow black citizens in honoring and observing the boycott because they wanted the boycott. \"","start":576.135,"stop":589.21,"duration":13.08},{"text":"My third point is a corollary of the first two.","start":589.21,"stop":593.179,"duration":3.97},{"text":"We submit that no one may be held liable constitutionally merely for organizing or participating in a political boycott in support of a petition for the redress of grievance, or for enforcing it by non-violent means, or for continuing to support it even though some other participants have been engaging in acts of violence.","start":593.179,"stop":624.133,"duration":30.95},{"text":"Our first four Presidents, all three authors of The Federalist Papers, and many other Framers of the Constitution participated in several boycotts of precisely this kind.","start":624.133,"stop":640.744,"duration":16.61},{"text":"They believed them to be a lawful method of supporting the right of British subjects to petition for the redress of grievances, and when they adopted the First Amendment, we submit, they could not possibly have intended to exclude from its protection the very means of petition that they themselves had employed.","start":640.744,"stop":663.943,"duration":23.2},{"text":"Indeed, after the revolution, and at the very time that the Constitution was being ratified, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton were leading a boycott enforced by similar non-violent means against New York City merchants who engaged in the slave trade, and against newspapers which carried the advertisements of those merchants.","start":663.943,"stop":691.677,"duration":27.73},{"text":"I would also add that we are not... we don't think this case raises, of course, the issue of whether such boycotts are a wise political tactic, but only whether they are protected by the First Amendment, and we don't think this case presents the issue of the constitutionality of a secondary political boycott against neutral parties, even though colonial history would support that, because these merchants were deeply involved both in their own discriminatory policies and those of the city and county governments, and because the Mississippi Supreme Court adopted a theory of liability which expressly stated it didn't matter whether the boycott was primary, secondary, or anything else.","start":691.677,"stop":749.966,"duration":58.29},{"text":"Nor do we think this case presents the issue of the constitutionality of a boycott that is unrelated to a petition for the redress of grievances against the government.","start":749.966,"stop":762.023,"duration":12.06},{"text":"Now, I would like, if I could, to come back to the 12 incidents.","start":762.023,"stop":766.141,"duration":4.12},{"text":"They are summarized at Pages 28 through 33 of our main brief.","start":766.141,"stop":771.712,"duration":5.57},{"text":"In only one
