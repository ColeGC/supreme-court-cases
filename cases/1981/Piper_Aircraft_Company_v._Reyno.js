Court today restricts the appeal to the sole question of whether a federal court action brought by a non-resident foreign plaintiff against an American defendant, whether in that type of action the plaintiff may defeat a motion to dismiss brought on the ground of foreign non-convenience merely by showing that the substantive law that would be applied if the case were litigated in that plaintiff's own court would be different or less favorable than it would be if it were tried here in America.","start":75.598,"stop":118.343,"duration":42.75},{"text":"The factual background of this

company.","start":144.894,"stop":157.385,"duration":12.49},{"text":"The aircraft was registered with the British authorities, and the pilot was licensed by the Scottish authorities, and the accident was investigated by the British Department of Trade.","start":157.385,"stop":170.626,"duration":13.24},{"text":"The Department's proposed report was the subject of an evidentiary hearing which was

alleges negligence and also strict liability.","start":221.059,"stop":238.604,"duration":17.55},{"text":"Although she sues as the personal representatives of the estates of these passengers, she is in

manufactured by Hartzell in Ohio.","start":265.605,"stop":289.805,"duration":24.2},{"text":"Almost immediately after its manufacture, the aircraft was sold to an interest in Ohio, and by some chain of

defendants had shown overwhelming reasons for a foreign non-convenience dismissal.","start":376.911,"stop":384.434,"duration":7.52},{"text":"And that court also said that it would be no less than an abuse of discretion on its part if it did not dismiss on the ground of foreign non-convenience, as the Gilbert criteria, quote, \"overwhelmingly point to dismissal\".","start":384.434,"stop":401.628,"duration":17.19},{"text":"The district court weighed all the private interest factors set forth in Gilbert, and found that they all clearly pointed to trial in Scotland.","start":401.628,"stop":411.834,"duration":10.21},{"text":"The district court also weighed the public interest factors laid down in Gilbert, and similarly concluded that all of these, too, favored the trial in Scotland.","start":411.834,"stop":422.209,"duration":10.38},{"text":"And in considering these public interests, the district court said that uppermost in its mind was the fact that a trial could be complex and confusing to a jury because it would have to apply the rule of law of Scotland to Hartzell and the rules of liability law of Pennsylvania to Piper.","start":422.209,"stop":444.739,"duration":22.53}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Fitzsimons, let me get a little more
