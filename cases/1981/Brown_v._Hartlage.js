court.","start":154.896,"stop":180.03,"duration":25.13},{"text":"A petition was then filed or motion for discretionary review to the Supreme Court of Kentucky, our now highest appellate court, and

facts.","start":192.088,"stop":197.742,"duration":5.65},{"text":"Carl Brown, the Petitioner in this matter, sought the office of county commissioner of Jefferson County, Kentucky.","start":197.742,"stop":205.979,"duration":8.24},{"text":"Jefferson County, Kentucky contains the only city of the first class in Kentucky, and in that regard in the Joint Appendix you will

will.","start":220.053,"stop":224.273,"duration":4.22},{"text":"But in any event, Carl Brown sought a seat on the Fiscal Court, which is our legislative body which along with the county judge executive forms the executive branch of government of the county, although it has legislative functions as well, pass ordinances, et cetera.","start":224.273,"stop":246.27,"duration":22},{"text":"This was in the election of 1979.","start":246.27,"stop":250.139,"duration":3.87},{"text":"Brown and a Dr. Bill Creech were running mates on a joint platform as the Republican candidates and ran against the Respondent, Earl Hartlage, as the Democratic incumbent.","start":250.139,"stop":265.767,"duration":15.63},{"text":"Now, the Petitioner and Creech campaigned on issues of governmental economy and the usual issues that one would expect of an election of that nature.","start":265.767,"stop":277.741,"duration":11.97},{"text":"Specifically, they zeroed in on some of Hartlage's spending and primarily in at least one press release that is available to you-all commented very unfavorably in regard to the salary which Mr. Hartlage had voted himself since he had been in office.","start":277.741,"stop":301.024,"duration":23.28},{"text":"In all events the election heated, and by August 15th, 1979 Creech and Brown issued a joint press release.","start":301.024,"stop":311.379,"duration":10.36},{"text":"That may be found at the Joint Appendix, page 2.","start":311.379,"stop":314.748,"duration":3.37},{"text":"And in that statement they attacked the frivolity of spending of Hartlage and almost in a manner as I perceive the statement and as it appears, almost in a manner of put up or shut up vein said to prove the strength of our convictions, we will reduce our salaries by the sum of $3,000 a year each.","start":314.748,"stop":340.066,"duration":25.32},{"text":"The statement was made, and within the next day or two a friend of Brown's contacted him and advised him that it may be arguable whether there was some problem legally with that statement or with that comment.","start":340.066,"stop":358.627,"duration":18.56},{"text":"Brown's a young lawyer, and he went to his office and indeed did some research and found that certainly someone had articulated an arguable question under the law of Kentucky, that there were some Kentucky cases that may look like they make that an illegal promise, that it is inconceivable that his election could have been voided.","start":358.627,"stop":382.393,"duration":23.77},{"text":"In all events on Monday, I believe, but the 19th day of August 1979, four days after the comment was made, Brown and Creech in a joint press conference, which received the same publicity and the same coverage as the original statement, retracted that statement.","start":382.393,"stop":405.174,"duration":22.78},{"text":"They acknowledged that the statement was perhaps arguably in error.","start":405.174,"stop":411.328,"duration":6.15},{"text":"They retracted the promise, said that they would not abide by the concept of that reduction.","start":411.328,"stop":419.934,"duration":8.61},{"text":"Now, the election was held on November the 6th, 1979, 78 days after the retraction.","start":419.934,"stop":428.955,"duration":9.02},{"text":"There had been no retreat from the retraction from the time it was made until the time of the election.","start":428.955,"stop":438.061,"duration":9.11},{"text":"The results of the election, of the 177,501 ballots cast, Brown received approximately 53 percent of the vote.","start":438.061,"stop":449.001,"duration":10.94},{"text":"He beat Hartlage by 10,151 ballots.","start":449.001,"stop":454.988,"duration":5.99},{"text":"And Dr. Creech was defeated.","start":454.988,"stop":458.273,"duration":3.29},{"text":"He was not elected, though having made the same commitment as Brown had made or the same promise.","start":458.273,"stop":465.927,"duration":7.65},{"text":"Seasonably, an election contest was filed in early December of 1979.","start":465.927,"stop":473.746,"duration":7.82},{"text":"An answer was appropriately filed and issues joined.","start":473.746,"stop":477.864,"duration":4.12},{"text":"In that answer the fifth affirmative defense raises the constitutional issues before this Court.","start":477.864,"stop":486.534,"duration":8.67},{"text":"They have consistently been argued and raised from the trial court through the Court of Appeals to this Court.","start":486.534,"stop":494.79,"duration":8.26},{"text":"Pardon me, please.","start":494.79,"stop":495.825,"duration":1.03},{"text":"The matter was tried in a bench trial on January 29th and 30th, 1980, and the evidence, among the rest of the evidence appears a stipulation by the Petitioner and by the Respondent that the retraction received as broad a coverage publicity-wise as the original statement.","start":495.825,"stop":527.095,"duration":31.27},{"text":"The trial court then rendered its decision and found that there was a technical, if you will... and that's my own characterization... a technical violation of KRS 121055, the statute which prohibited the promise to the electorate, but that the election was fair.","start":527.095,"stop":549.543,"duration":22.45},{"text":"And the trial judge found as a fact in his determination of the fairness of the election, he found five elements.","start":549.543,"stop":558.399,"duration":8.86},{"text":"He found that there was an almost immediate retraction.","start":558.399,"stop":562.951,"duration":4.55},{"text":"He found that there was no retreat from the retraction from the day it was made to the day of the election, and commented even though Mr. Brown had been challenged by Mr. Hartlage at some political conclave, Brown remained adamant in his retraction and did not deviate from that.","start":562.951,"stop":585.483,"duration":22.53},{"text":"The judge balanced the disenfranchisement of thousands of voters, as he put it, and the presumption of the will of the people and Creech's defeat, and found that the election was fair and that Brown should receive his office.","start":585.483,"stop":606.063,"duration":20.58},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in its original opinion rendered August the 8th, 1980 followed an old decision in Kentucky that harks back to 1960, Sparks against Boggs.","start":606.063,"stop":623.005,"duration":16.94},{"text":"And it may be appropriate for me to digress for a moment and advise the Court as to the ramifications of Sparks against Boggs and a prior opinion that harks to 1925, Owsley against Hill.","start":623.005,"stop":641.45,"duration":18.45},{"text":"These two cases, in my judgment, are probably interpretive of some phases of the statute and require some comment.","start":641.45,"stop":652.842,"duration":11.39},{"text":"In the Owsley matter the county attorney offered to serve for a salary of $400 less than the previous attorney had received.","start":652.842,"stop":668.803,"duration":15.96},{"text":"His salary had not been sent by the county commissioner.","start":668.803,"stop":672.755,"duration":3.95},{"text":"His election was challenged.","start":672.755,"stop":675.457,"duration":2.7},{"text":"He won, and his election was challenged.","start":675.457,"stop":678.992,"duration":3.53},{"text":"In any event, upon challenge the then Court of Appeals of Kentucky... and it was our highest court in 1925... held that the reduction of salary was a legal possibility in the context of the fact that it had not been set, and also said in its opinion that a promise that is made to the entire electorate is not a bribe and not to be conceived as a bribe, but it differentiated that from a promise made to a smaller group of the electorate.","start":678.992,"stop":718.652,"duration":39.66},{"text":"In that case then it was held that the county attorney would be seated.","start":718.652,"stop":727.222,"duration":8.57},{"text":"In 1960 in the matter of Sparks against Boggs, which itself was the election of a group of city commissioners of the city of Hazard, Kentucky who ran as platform.","start":727.222,"stop":740.613,"duration":13.39},{"text":"The salary in that instance had been previously set by statute at $500 each per year.","start":740.613,"stop":749.468,"duration":8.85},{"text":"The commissioners promised as a plank of their platform that they would forego all but a dollar of that sum and contribute it to various charitable, some civic, Little League, and organizations of that sort.","start":749.468,"stop":768.263,"duration":18.8},{"text":"It was not a commitment to the entire electorate but to a select group in the electorate.","start":768.263,"stop":774.267,"duration":6},{"text":"The Court of Appeals of Kentucky in that case distinguished Owsley... again, that was our highest court at the time... distinguished Owsley and in effect said that the promise to serve for less was a bribe and as such should be barred.","start":774.267,"stop":796.949,"duration":22.68},{"text":"Now, in that light we find that the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in the Carl Brown case, the case before you this morning, in the Carl Brown case held that Brown could not legally do the act, he could not legally reduce his salary; and in that regard there was no exception in the statute for a retraction; in that regard that the other considerations of the trial court were inapplicable and not to be
