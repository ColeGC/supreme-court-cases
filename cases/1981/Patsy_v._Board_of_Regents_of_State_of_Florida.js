generally.","start":545.156,"stop":548.936,"duration":3.78},{"text":"Instead, it made a small exception to the rule because it decided that prisoner cases posed a unique problem warranting a unique solution.","start":548.936,"stop":556.464,"duration":7.53},{"text":"Finally, and most importantly, Congress built on the non-exhaustion rule for its own special purposes.","start":556.464,"stop":562.384,"duration":5.92},{"text":"Congress rejected a proposal to subject prisoners to general exhaustion requirements such as those imposed on 1983 by the Fifth

exhaustion, which Congress rejected, would have accomplished that.","start":587.061,"stop":591.621,"duration":4.56},{"text":"Instead, Congress used this new exhaustion requirement for some 1983 cases, as an inducement, a carrot you will, to achieve particular substantive goals as a matter of national policy.","start":591.621,"stop":603.867,"duration":12.25},{"text":"The non-exhaustion rule is thus not just the background against which this case must be decided.","start":603.867,"stop":608.413,"duration":4.55},{"text":"It was the principal justification for 1997e, and indispensable for its effectiveness.","start":608.413,"stop":614.488,"duration":6.08},{"text":"Congress would not have passed 1997e if exhaustion was already permitted under 1983.","start":614.488,"stop":620.299,"duration":5.81},{"text":"More importantly, reading a general exhaustion requirement into 1983 would render the statute a dead letter.","start":620.299,"stop":626.748,"duration":6.45},{"text":"Only on the premise that 1983 cases cannot already be subject to exhaustion does the inducement mechanism that Congress created make sense.","start":626.748,"stop":635.198,"duration":8.45},{"text":"The states have no reason to adopt the particular procedures Congress meant to foster if their 1983 prison cases are already subject to exhaustion.","start":635.198,"stop":643.836,"duration":8.64},{"text":"In short, we think that 1997e makes this case even easier than its predecessors.","start":643.836,"stop":650.114,"duration":6.28},{"text":"The legislative history shows far more than passivity and silence.","start":650.114,"stop":653.706,"duration":3.59},{"text":"Instead, it shows that Congress has accepted the rule and built on it.","start":653.706,"stop":657.408,"duration":3.7},{"text":"Congress has put itself directly in the business of deciding when and to what extent and under what conditions exhaustion will be required.","start":657.408,"stop":666.154,"duration":8.75},{"text":"In these circumstances, further alteration of the rule is plainly a matter for Congress.","start":666.154,"stop":670.824,"duration":4.67},{"text":"As the court held in the Alyeska Pipeline case, when Congress begins making an exception to a general rule, even a general rule
