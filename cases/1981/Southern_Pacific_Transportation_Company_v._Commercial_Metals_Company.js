Pipkin, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, that involves the business relationships essentially between the consignor and the consignee.","start":426.422,"stop":433.217,"duration":6.79},{"text":"Any consignee would rather receive goods on credit, and most goods do move on credit.","start":433.217,"stop":443.508,"duration":10.29},{"text":"Approximately 95 % of the goods in interstate freight transportation move on credit.","start":443.508,"stop":448.6,"duration":5.09},{"text":"If the consignor signs the non-recourse clause which says that he is not liable for payment, the carrier is then more likely to deliver that shipment to the consignee on a COD basis, unless he knows the consignee well and has dealt with him in the past.","start":448.6,"stop":467.78,"duration":19.18},{"text":"The consignee clearly would rather not have that situation arise, and if he has two prospective sellers of goods, one of which will not sign the non-recourse clause and one which does, he would rather get the goods from the consignor so it will arrive on a credit basis rather than COD.","start":467.78,"stop":488.709,"duration":20.93},{"text":"But that is really a business judgment and it involves, to some extent, almost whether it is deemed insulting to the consignee to receive it on that basis.","start":488.709,"stop":501.657,"duration":12.95},{"text":"But in any event, the continuing liability of the consignor who does not sign the non-recourse clause is clear from the language of the bill of lading and clear under the case law for the last 60 years, and in fact, as this Court has expressly recognized that in the Illinois Steel case cited in our briefs.","start":501.657,"stop":521.274,"duration":19.62},{"text":"The cases also indicate that under the Interstate Commerce Act, the carrier has a duty to collect the freight charge, and if he cannot collect it from the consignee, he must try to collect it from the consignor.","start":521.274,"stop":537.08,"duration":15.81},{"text":"Allowing a violation of the credit regulations to be used as a bar against collection from the consignor would be inconsistent with those cases and the essential purposes that they endorse.","start":537.08,"stop":549.637,"duration":12.56},{"text":"Apart from the contract, the principal reason for our position basically is the statute and the regulations are part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme, and they are totally silent on any affirmative defense arising from violation of the credit regulations.","start":549.637,"stop":564.35,"duration":14.71},{"text":"And I would like to speak just for a second about the history.","start":564.35,"stop":567.426,"duration":3.08},{"text":"The credit regulations can be traced back to 1918 during the first World War when the Director General of the railroads then issued something called General Order Number 25, which essentially put interstate freight transportation on a cash basis, with a few exceptions.","start":567.426,"stop":583.952,"duration":16.53},{"text":"The purposes are undisputed for taking that action.","start":583.952,"stop":588.09,"duration":4.14},{"text":"They were to increase the working capital of the carriers by reducing the amount of freight charges that would be outstanding, owed by the consignees, and to reduce discrimination.","start":588.09,"stop":600.758,"duration":12.67},{"text":"And when in 1920 the Congress enacted what became Section 3(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, the issue here involved... that is the basis for the credit regulations.","start":600.758,"stop":610.269,"duration":9.51},{"text":"The continued that same policy.","start":610.269,"stop":612.267,"duration":2},{"text":"Carriers were told that they could not deliver freight until the charges were paid, except under such rules and regulations as the commission should prescribe.","start":612.267,"stop":621.608,"duration":9.34},{"text":"The same purposes were true, though... to protect the carriers and their working capital, and to prevent discrimination.","start":621.608,"stop":628.684,"duration":7.08},{"text":"And the regulations adopted by the commission left a great deal of discretion to the carriers.","start":628.684,"stop":634.588,"duration":5.9},{"text":"The main one is one that says that the carrier can extend credit for a specific period upon taking whatever precautions are deemed by it to be adequate to assure payment.","start":634.588,"stop":645.333,"duration":10.75},{"text":"Those regulations are still in effect and have been for 61 years, they are enforced by the Interstate Commerce Commission primarily through a $5000 civil penalty, but also occasionally by cease and desist orders or injunctive proceedings.","start":645.333,"stop":661.81,"duration":16.48},{"text":"And in this whole regulatory scheme there is no hint that a credit violation can be utilized as an affirmative defense, or that Congress intended that to be an enforcement mechanism.","start":661.81,"stop":672.947,"duration":11.14},{"text":"And that engrafting such a defense on the regulatory scheme would in no way further the purposes of that scheme, which were to protect the carrier's working capital and to prevent discrimination.","start":672.947,"stop":684.615,"duration":11.67},{"text":"In addition, the ICC has taken a very clear position on this same issue that is before the Court.","start":684.615,"stop":691.22,"duration":6.61},{"text":"It has expressly said in the CGF Grain case that we cite in our briefs that a credit regulation... credit violation,
