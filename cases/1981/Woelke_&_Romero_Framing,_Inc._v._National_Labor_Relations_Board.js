Circuit.","start":15.87,"stop":30.253,"duration":14.38},{"text":"The en banc court below affirmed the Labor Board's decision that the construction unions involved in this case did not violate Section 8(b)(4)(A) of the Labor Act by picketing to obtain certain restrictive union-only subcontracting provisions which are commonly called subcontractor's clauses because both the court and the Board believed that such provisions were protected by the construction proviso to Section 8(e) of the Labor Act.","start":30.253,"stop":61.803,"duration":31.55},{"text":"Two questions are thus presented to the Court.","start":61.803,"stop":64.646,"duration":2.84},{"text":"First, are subcontractor's clauses always valid under the construction proviso simply because they are contained in a lawful collective bargaining relationship between the union and the employer?","start":64.646,"stop":76.876,"duration":12.23},{"text":"Second, can a union lawfully picket to obtain such clauses?","start":76.876,"stop":82.279,"duration":5.4},{"text":"We believe the answer to both questions is no.","start":82.279,"stop":86.543,"duration":4.26},{"text":"We hope to persuade the Court that the Labor Board's decision and the court below's decision is contrary to the legislative history to Section 8(e) of the Labor Act, and contrary to the reasoning of this Court in Connell Construction, which was decided by the Court in 1975.","start":86.543,"stop":107.05,"duration":20.51},{"text":"The facts of this case are fairly straightforward.","start":107.05,"stop":109.566,"duration":2.52},{"text":"The Petitioner, Woelke and Romero, had a collective bargaining relationship with the unions, and in 1977, as the most currently contract to which it was party was about to expire, engaged in bargaining for a successor contract.","start":109.566,"stop":122.873,"duration":13.31},{"text":"During the negotiations, the unions proposed the subcontractor clauses for Woelke and Romero to execute.","start":122.873,"stop":130.058,"duration":7.18},{"text":"Woelke and Romero refused.","start":130.058,"stop":132.119,"duration":2.06},{"text":"An impasse in bargaining developed, and in support of the union's provisions, the unions picketed various job sites to which Woelke and Romero at that time was working.","start":132.119,"stop":143.223,"duration":11.1},{"text":"Woelke filed appropriate charges with the Labor Board, and this litigation ensued.","start":143.223,"stop":148.877,"duration":5.65},{"text":"First, I think the Court should understand what kind of subcontracting provisions these are.","start":148.877,"stop":154.874,"duration":6},{"text":"These are not provisions which restrict subcontracting simply to the bargaining unit.","start":154.874,"stop":162.294,"duration":7.42},{"text":"In other words, these provisions prevail upon the employees and employers outside the bargaining unit.","start":162.294,"stop":169.072,"duration":6.78},{"text":"Thus, these provisions clearly do not say that Woelke and Romero may not subcontract work or may not subcontract work if its employees are on layoff.","start":169.072,"stop":181.535,"duration":12.46},{"text":"These provisions simply tell the employer which employers it may otherwise do business with.","start":181.535,"stop":189.377,"duration":7.84},{"text":"They apply to the work only of the contracting union.","start":189.377,"stop":192.859,"duration":3.48},{"text":"They name the particular union with which the subcontractor must be party.","start":192.859,"stop":197.78,"duration":4.92},{"text":"They apply to all job sites of the contractor or subcontractors.","start":197.78,"stop":201.638,"duration":3.86},{"text":"They apply to all tiers of subcontracting, and they apply in futuro to all job sites without regard to the presence or absence of union members on particular job sites.","start":201.638,"stop":213.665,"duration":12.03},{"text":"They apply to the entire geographic area covered by the collective bargaining agreement, and they simply do not do anything other than to assist the construction unions who are party to the clauses in their organizing attempt in that geographic area.","start":213.665,"stop":232.048,"duration":18.38},{"text":"Thus, in order for a subcontractor to be eligible to compete for the contractor's work, he must agree to sign the same exact union contract to which the contractor is party, and that subcontractor's employees must designate the particular union that is mentioned in the subcontractor clause in order for their employer to be eligible to do the work.","start":232.048,"stop":257.411,"duration":25.36},{"text":"We believe that these kinds of clauses have serious antitrust and labor implications.","start":257.411,"stop":262.395,"duration":4.98},{"text":"Although this is not an antitrust case, the Court should recognize the breadth of the boycott that is involved.","start":262.395,"stop":269.579,"duration":7.18},{"text":"The contractor is precluded from doing work... or the subcontractor is precluded from doing work unless he is party to that contract.","start":269.579,"stop":279.841,"duration":10.26},{"text":"The boycott extends beyond what we believe is any legitimate union purpose.","start":279.841,"stop":284.855,"duration":5.01},{"text":"The clauses seek to regulate the working conditions and the market area of the construction union involved.","start":284.855,"stop":292.57,"duration":7.71},{"text":"As this Court noted, labor policy does not require that a union have freedom to impose direct restraints on competition among those who employ its members.","start":292.57,"stop":303.738,"duration":11.17},{"text":"We believe that that is what these clauses in effect do.","start":303.738,"stop":307.441,"duration":3.7},{"text":"Further, the labor policy implications of these clauses are that the union in effect has a broad top-down organizing tool which is contained in the union contract, which again, we believe, is contrary to the Connell decision of this Court in 1975, and contrary to the legislative intent in 1959.","start":307.441,"stop":332.226,"duration":24.79},{"text":"In 1959, Congress passed Section 8(e) to the Labor Act.","start":332.226,"stop":337.74,"duration":5.51},{"text":"It added that section to the Act with the purpose of trying to prevent secondary boycott agreements.","start":337.74,"stop":346.267,"duration":8.53},{"text":"In 1958, this Court in its decision in Sandor had held that regardless of whether or not a voluntary agreement contained in a collective bargaining agreement conducted a secondary boycott against other people, the union could not use coercive pressure to enforce that agreement.","start":346.267,"stop":367.118,"duration":20.85},{"text":"In 1959, in enacting Section 8(e) to the Act, Congress intended to interdict those agreements to conduct secondary boycotts.","start":367.118,"stop":377.771,"duration":10.65},{"text":"As far as the construction industry is concerned, however, Congress granted a limited exception to construction unions.","start":377.771,"stop":386.611,"duration":8.84},{"text":"In doing so, they limited that exception to subcontracting or contracting of work at particular job sites and did not give construction unions otherwise a right to engage in organizing from the top down.","start":386.611,"stop":401.994,"duration":15.38},{"text":"By definition, top-down organizing is used by the construction unions to organize the employer rather than the employees of that employer.","start":401.994,"stop":413.506,"duration":11.51},{"text":"In other words, the union puts pressure on the employer to sign a collective bargaining agreement, notwithstanding the fact that the employer's employees may not want to be represented by the union.","start":413.506,"stop":425.438,"duration":11.93},{"text":"That kind of top-down organizing was interdicted both by Section 8(e), as far as most other industries are concerned, but also by other Labor Act provisions, specifically Section 8(b)(7) and also by strengthening Section 8(b)(4) of the Labor Act.","start":425.438,"stop":442.166,"duration":16.73},{"text":"To the extent that the construction proviso to 8(e) gives the construction unions an exemption, it would be contrary to that legislative intent to permit top-down organizing by that proviso.","start":442.166,"stop":456.192,"duration":14.03},{"text":"Rather, since the construction proviso to Section 8(e) was intended in part to overrule this Court's 1951 decision in Denver Building Trades, it is clear in our judgment that the proviso to Section 8(e) only exempts those otherwise secondary provisions which would be within the prohibition to Section 8(e) which are related to the Denver Building Trades' interests.","start":456.192,"stop":485.976,"duration":29.78},{"text":"What are those interests?","start":485.976,"stop":489.287,"duration":3.31},{"text":"Those interests are to prevent the alleviation of the job site tension on particular job sites that may develop between union and non-union workers.","start":489.287,"stop":503.188,"duration":13.9},{"text":"But it is only those particular job sites at which union and non-union workers are working where that job site friction may develop.","start":503.188,"stop":512.763,"duration":9.58},{"text":"Therefore, unless the union has an identifiable dispute at a particular construction project where and when union and non-union workers are working side by side, there is no legitimate interest sheltered by the proviso that should give a construction union the right to engage in this kind of broad boycott.","start":512.763,"stop":535.644,"duration":22.88},{"text":"A construction union does not need a top-down organizing subcontracting restriction in order to alleviate that interest.","start":535.644,"stop":544.641,"duration":9},{"text":"It does not need to require the contractor to specify to the subcontractor which union that subcontractor's employees must designate as their bargaining representative in order to be eligible to compete for the work at that project.","start":544.641,"stop":561.992,"duration":17.35},{"text":"Our adversaries, the Respondents in this matter, argue that the construction industry proviso had more than one purpose.","start":561.992,"stop":570.223,"duration":8.23},{"text":"They argue that Congress intended by their proviso to preserve a pattern of collective bargaining which they say existed prior to 1959.","start":570.223,"stop":580.454,"duration":10.23},{"text":"We do not believe the legislative history or this Court's previous decision in Connell supports that argument.","start":580.454,"stop":587.28,"duration":6.83},{"text":"Rather, this Court apparently dismissed that argument in 1975, for that argument is based solely on one small reference in the legislative history by Senator, later President Kennedy, in which he said that the proviso was added to avoid serious damage to the pattern of collective bargaining.","start":587.28,"stop":611.816,"duration":24.54},{"text":"There was no further expression in the legislative history, in any of the committee reports, as to that purpose.","start":611.816,"stop":620.688,"duration":8.87},{"text":"Completely opposite to the Labor Board's interpretation of the purpose of the proviso is the manner in which the proviso was added to
