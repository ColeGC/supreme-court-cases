Regulatory Policies Act, one of five statutes enacted in 1978 as part of a comprehensive effort to deal with this nation's energy problems.","start":82.077,"stop":97.977,"duration":15.9},{"text":"It would be helpful to consider the statute in two basic parts.","start":97.977,"stop":102.116,"duration":4.14},{"text":"The first part consists of Titles I and III, which share three common statutorily-identified goals.","start":102.116,"stop":109.924,"duration":7.81},{"text":"The first is to promote the conservation of energy supplied by utilities; second is to optimize the efficient use of facilities and resources by utilities; and the third is to ensure equitable rights to consumers.","start":109.924,"stop":123.936,"duration":14.01},{"text":"Title I deals with electricity, and Title III with gas.","start":123.936,"stop":128.386,"duration":4.45},{"text":"Title I requires state regulatory authorities and non-regulated electric utilities to consider the adoption of one set of standards, six in number, dealing with electric rates, and a second set of standards, five in number, dealing with terms and conditions of electric service.","start":128.386,"stop":147.924,"duration":19.54},{"text":"The rate standards, all of them, and some of the electric service standards are directed toward two objectives.","start":147.924,"stop":154.235,"duration":6.31},{"text":"The first is to cut down the amount of electric energy, and therefore imported oil, that is consumed in this country.","start":154.235,"stop":160.42,"duration":6.18},{"text":"And the second objective is to shift electric demand away from peak periods, thereby diminishing the use of less efficient generating facilities and scarce fuels; notably, oil.","start":160.42,"stop":173.477,"duration":13.06},{"text":"As to gas, Title III requires consideration of only two of the terms service standards.","start":173.477,"stop":181.24,"duration":7.76},{"text":"Each of the standards, both Title I and Title III, is to be considered in a hearing after public notice, and a written statement of the reasons for declining to implement or adopt... in the event of a declamation to implement or adopt... any of the standards is to be made available to the public.","start":181.24,"stop":198.951,"duration":17.71},{"text":"In addition, Titles I and III require that within one year after enactment of the statute and annually thereafter for ten years, state

reports to Congress.","start":198.951,"stop":220.505,"duration":21.55},{"text":"The other part of the statute is Title II, probably the most controversial.","start":220.505,"stop":223.864,"duration":3.36},{"text":"Specifically, Section 210, whose objective is to encourage the development of cogeneration and small power production facilities.","start":223.864,"stop":234.499,"duration":10.63},{"text":"Cogeneration is the combined product of both electrical energy and useful thermal energy such as heat or steam from a single

accounted for some 15 % of this nation's energy total, but with the advent of cheap fossil fuel power, that has diminished to 4 %.","start":248.322,"stop":259.053,"duration":10.73},{"text":"A small power production facility is a facility having a capacity of no more than 80 megawatts and using something other fossil fuels, defined by the statute as biomass, waste, geothermal or renewable resources such as wind, water, solar energy, for the purpose of producing electric power.","start":259.053,"stop":279.153,"duration":20.1},{"text":"Congress identified two impediments to the potential of cogeneration and small power production facilities as additional sources of domestic power with consequent lessening of dependence on foreign oil.","start":279.153,"stop":293.241,"duration":14.09},{"text":"The first was its conclusion that subjecting cogeneration and small power production facilities to the usual state and federal regulatory burdens was unnecessary and would unduly discourage their development.","start":293.241,"stop":306.299,"duration":13.06},{"text":"The more controversial aspect of the congressional determination was the second.","start":306.299,"stop":312.296,"duration":6},{"text":"These two types of facilities must rely on traditional electric utilities, both as a source of backup power, and also as a market for their surplus power.","start":312.296,"stop":322.417,"duration":10.12},{"text":"They do not sell generally to the public.","start":322.417,"stop":324.26,"duration":1.84},{"text":"They use them only for their own purposes.","start":324.26,"stop":325.681,"duration":1.42},{"text":"Evidence before Congress showed that since these facilities are potential competitors of public utilities, utilities were often less than cooperative in supplying either backup power or markets.","start":325.681,"stop":339.395,"duration":13.71},{"text":"PURPA deals with each of these impediments.","start":339.395,"stop":342.644,"duration":3.25},{"text":"Its response to the problem of surplus and backup power is the most hotly-contested of the Act's provisions.","start":342.644,"stop":349.954,"duration":7.31},{"text":"What Congress eventually adopted in this respect represents a compromise.","start":349.954,"stop":354.655,"duration":4.7},{"text":"The administration's proposal, which passed the House and was sent to the Senate, would have established a regulatory program virtually identical to that upheld by this Court in the Virginia Surface Mining Act case last term, under which the regulatory burden would have been assumed by federal authorities in the event that state authorities chose not to participate.","start":354.655,"stop":379.723,"duration":25.07},{"text":"At the other end of the spectrum, the Senate bill would have required the Secretary to follow basically the Title I/Title III approach, which is simply to recommend guidelines to state public service commissions that they could adopt or not.","start":379.723,"stop":393.061,"duration":13.34},{"text":"Opponents of the administration House bill, by the time it got to the Senate, presented to Congress substantial testimony and arguments to the effect that it was state rather than federal officials who possess the necessary expertise to implement reforms.","start":393.061,"stop":409.804,"duration":16.74},{"text":"The legislation dealing with these issues should be responsive to local needs and local differences, and that what might be appropriate for Florida might not necessarily be appropriate for Oregon.","start":409.804,"stop":422.534,"duration":12.73},{"text":"And that the states should be allowed to continue to experiment in the national interest with different regulatory approaches.","start":422.534,"stop":429.485,"duration":6.95},{"text":"The compromise that became law was responsive to these arguments, which were grounded in the preservation of state interests.","start":429.485,"stop":438.418,"duration":8.93},{"text":"The Act, in fact, gives the authority to make general rules to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in order to achieve the general objectives of the Act, but with the more specific authority to implement the statute being left to the states.","start":438.418,"stop":454.974,"duration":16.56},{"text":"The Commission has, in fact, adopted regulations which afford the states great latitude in determining how the congressional objectives are to be achieved.","start":454.974,"stop":463.83,"duration":8.86},{"text":"Under these regulations, state implementation may be accomplished by any one of three ways.","start":463.83,"stop":471.781,"duration":7.95},{"text":"First of all, by the issuance of regulations.","start":471.781,"stop":474.107,"duration":2.33},{"text":"Second, and probably most important for purposes of this lawsuit, by the resolution of disputes between utilities and qualifying facilities on a case-by-case basis.","start":474.107,"stop":487.523,"duration":13.42},{"text":"And the third is a general catch-all; by any other action reasonably designed to give effect to the
