discriminate, and neither knew nor had reason to know that the discrimination for which they were held liable was being practiced.","start":109.612,"stop":151.079,"duration":41.47},{"text":"Thus, the general question presented hereby is whether Section 1981 does indeed reach so far.","start":151.079,"stop":160.2,"duration":9.12},{"text":"The case began in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 1971 when 12 blacks in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sued, among others, a construction union, a construction contractor, and three contractor associations for racial discrimination under, among other statutes, Section 1981.","start":160.2,"stop":181.864,"duration":21.66},{"text":"The focus of the complaint was the union's exclusive referral system which was found by the trial court and not challenged, was facially neutral.","start":181.864,"stop":194.328,"duration":12.46},{"text":"The action was certified as a class action on both the Plaintiff and the Defendant's sides, the

class members, which included hiring quotas and training programs.","start":252.836,"stop":263.596,"duration":10.76},{"text":"Stated in a somewhat simplified fashion, the trial court's decision under Section 1981 respecting Glasgow was that the union, defendant union intentionally discriminated against minorities in the operation of its referral system, and solely because Glasgow, acting pursuant to a lawful contractual duty, notified the union of its need for workmen, and thereafter hired persons referred by the union, it, too, was enveloped within the Section 1981 net.","start":263.596,"stop":304.643,"duration":41.05},{"text":"I might again add that the trial court found... and those findings are unchallenged... that Glasgow itself did not discriminate, did not

discrimination.","start":304.643,"stop":323.65,"duration":19.01},{"text":"The Third Circuit en banc divided equally, thereby affirming, and did not seek... and did not issue any

obtain operating engineers for employment from no other source except the union's referral system.","start":397.605,"stop":411.582,"duration":13.98},{"text":"As presented by the union in the negotiations and as found by the courts below and unchallenged here, the union's referral system was racially neutral.","start":411.582,"stop":424.171,"duration":12.59},{"text":"Glasgow and the other employers who were involved in that particular negotiation wanted no part of this provision, and accordingly gave an outright rejection to this union demand.","start":424.171,"stop":438.089,"duration":13.92},{"text":"An impasse in bargaining ensued, and because the demand was and is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining under federal law, the union, with impunity, struck Glasgow and the other employers to force their agreement to the union's referral system.","start":438.089,"stop":456.86,"duration":18.77},{"text":"After a ten week strike which the trial court called destructive, Glasgow and the others capitulated to the union and thereupon agreed to notify the union of the need for workmen so that referrals could be made by the union to them.","start":456.86,"stop":475.979,"duration":19.12},{"text":"In 1963 an attempt was made by Glasgow and other contractors to rid themselves of the referral provision but a strike, another strike, lengthy strike rendered this unsuccessful.","start":475.979,"stop":492.221,"duration":16.24},{"text":"The duty to notify the union of a need for workmen and to consider referrals for employment has been a part of all labor agreements between Glasgow and the Engineers Union since then.","start":492.221,"stop":506.966,"duration":14.75},{"text":"The union's referral system places engineers in groups upon length of service and aligns and refers them on a first in-first out basis.","start":506.966,"stop":516.259,"duration":9.29},{"text":"Throughout the entire period covered by this case, the registration, the grouping within this referral system, the aligning within the groups, and indeed, the referrals were performed solely and exclusively by employees of the union.","start":516.259,"stop":538.563,"duration":22.3},{"text":"As contractually and indeed legally obligated to do, Glasgow used the system by notifying the union of its need and then hiring referrals therefrom.","start":538.563,"stop":552.041,"duration":13.48},{"text":"The District Court specifically determined that the employees of the union who, without the knowledge or any reason to know by Glasgow that these employees who registered, grouped, aligned and referred engineers, failed to do so in accordance with the rules governing the system.","start":552.041,"stop":572.174,"duration":20.13},{"text":"In the words of the trial court, the union procedures in general constituted a motley fabric of arbitrary departure from the rules.","start":572.174,"stop":583.934,"duration":11.76},{"text":"Instead, and in breach of the collective bargaining agreement with Glasgow, those employees of the union registered, grouped, aligned
