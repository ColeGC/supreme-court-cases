first.","start":61.194,"stop":70.441,"duration":9.25},{"text":"We think in finding a fundamental right on a par with freedom of speech and religion, right to travel and other important rights that the

test.","start":636.948,"stop":647.054,"duration":10.11},{"text":"Now, that is not a state question.","start":647.054,"stop":649.521,"duration":2.47},{"text":"There is no state rule of law to that effect.","start":649.521,"stop":652.489,"duration":2.97},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, even in their discussion of the \"rational basis\", first found that there was a fundamental right, that of association, and then reasoned backwards by placing the burden of proof on the City, saying the City failed to produce evidence to show this and that.","start":652.489,"stop":678.448,"duration":25.96},{"text":"Therefore throughout the opinion... and I realize that we're not appealing from the opinion, we're appealing from the judgment.","start":678.448,"stop":687.006,"duration":8.56},{"text":"But I think the judgment is incorrect because of a body of federal law that the Court of Appeals misapplied, not any state

doctrine.","start":697.423,"stop":704.874,"duration":7.45},{"text":"Looking at the application of law to children, as I say, I think the Court of Appeals improperly applied rules of law pertaining to
