Alito, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":77.333,"stop":83.587,"duration":6.25},{"text":"This case is here on Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.","start":83.587,"stop":89.724,"duration":6.14},{"text":"The issue in this case is where a former employee of a military exchange who was appointed to his position and subsequently discharged may sue for money damages under the Tucker Act based upon an alleged contract, the existence of which is inferred solely from personnel regulations in effect at the time of his separation.","start":89.724,"stop":112.506,"duration":22.78},{"text":"The basic facts in this case are as follows.","start":112.506,"stop":116.558,"duration":4.05},{"text":"In 1962 the respondent, Arthur Sheehan, was appointed to a position with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, an instrumentality of the United States.","start":116.558,"stop":127.283,"duration":10.72},{"text":"The regulations governing Mr. Sheehan's employment by the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, AAFES as it is called, were the very same regulations considered by this Court in United States versus Hopkins in 1976.","start":127.283,"stop":143.725,"duration":16.44},{"text":"In 1967, five years after his initial employment, Mr. Sheehan was designated by the Commander of AAFES for participation in a special program for AAFES executives, called the Executive Management Program.","start":143.725,"stop":158.718,"duration":14.99},{"text":"Under that program, he obtained certain special benefits, but also incurred certain special obligations; principally, the possibility of transfer to any AAFES facility.","start":158.718,"stop":170.026,"duration":11.31},{"text":"He was required to sign a written acknowledgement of the special conditions of Executive Management Program participation.","start":170.026,"stop":178.299,"duration":8.27},{"text":"By 1975, the respondent had achieved an AAFES rank equivalent to a Lieutenant Colonel.","start":178.299,"stop":185.72,"duration":7.42},{"text":"In November of that year he was arrested on drug charges and subsequently pleaded guilty.","start":185.72,"stop":192.041,"duration":6.32},{"text":"The Service then began administrative proceedings which resulted in his discharge.","start":192.041,"stop":197.277,"duration":5.24},{"text":"He appealed the discharge but the appellate authority, the Commander of AAFES, denied the appeal.","start":197.277,"stop":203.597,"duration":6.32},{"text":"Mr. Sheehan then sought reconsideration claiming that he had been denied a fair appeal because the Commander of AAFES who acted as the appellate authority had given prior approval for the initial discharge notice.","start":203.597,"stop":216.674,"duration":13.08},{"text":"As a result of that complaint, Mr. Sheehas was, in effect, granted a new appeal to the next higher authority in the Service, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of AAFES.","start":216.674,"stop":227.731,"duration":11.06},{"text":"His appeal, however, was once again denied.","start":227.731,"stop":230.933,"duration":3.2},{"text":"In the meantime, he had initiated suit in the Northern District of Texas seeking reinstatement as well as compensatory and punitive damages.","start":230.933,"stop":241.056,"duration":10.12},{"text":"He claimed that AAFES had violated its own regulations because of the dual role played by the Commander.","start":241.056,"stop":247.626,"duration":6.57},{"text":"He also claimed that his discharge was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, unwarranted by the facts and in violation of various, unspecified statutory and constitutional provisions.","start":247.626,"stop":260.953,"duration":13.33},{"text":"Notably, his complaint did not allege that he had ever been employed pursuant to any contract with AAFES, whether express or implied.","start":260.953,"stop":270.225,"duration":9.27},{"text":"He invoked the court's jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and various other statutes not now at issue.","start":270.225,"stop":277.062,"duration":6.84},{"text":"The Service moved to dismiss his complaint noting that he had been an appointed, non-contract employee.","start":277.062,"stop":284.068,"duration":7.01},{"text":"In response, he did not seek to amend his complaint to allege the existence of a contractual relationship, nor did he adduce any proof whatsoever that he had ever been employed pursuant to contract.","start":284.068,"stop":297.209,"duration":13.14},{"text":"The district court granted the motion to dismiss but the court of appeals reversed.","start":297.209,"stop":302.613,"duration":5.4},{"text":"The court held that jurisdiction existed with respect to his claims for monetary relief under the Tucker Act because AAFES personnel regulations in effect at the time of his discharge were by themselves sufficient to give rise to what the court called a collateral implied-in-fact contract between the Service and respondent.","start":302.613,"stop":324.712,"duration":22.1},{"text":"The court also held that there was jurisdiction with respect to his claims for non-monetary relief, but that question is not at issue here.","start":324.712,"stop":332.632,"duration":7.92},{"text":"In our view, the decision of the court of appeals with respect to respondent's claims for monetary relief is clearly wrong.","start":332.632,"stop":340.572,"duration":7.94},{"text":"It is inconsistent with this Court's decisions in Hopkins and Testan.","start":340.572,"stop":344.79,"duration":4.22},{"text":"It is a patent attempt to circumvent the decision of Congress excluding employees of AAFES and the military exchanges from the coverage of the Back Pay Act, which is, of course, the provision of federal law providing a waiver of sovereign immunity for back pay claims by regular federal officials... federal employees, I should say.","start":344.79,"stop":366.555,"duration":21.76},{"text":"The decision of the court of appeals is also contrary to basic principles of contract law, and if the court's reasoning were widely accepted it would have far-reaching and clearly unacceptable consequences.","start":366.555,"stop":378.863,"duration":12.31},{"text":"The basic principles governing this case are well-established and I don't believe they are disputed by respondent.","start":378.863,"stop":387.035,"duration":8.17},{"text":"The United States is immune from suit unless Congress consents.","start":387.035,"stop":390.987,"duration":3.95},{"text":"A waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressed rather than implied.","start":390.987,"stop":394.972,"duration":3.98},{"text":"Therefore, a valid waiver may be found only in a constitutional provision, statute or valid regulation that confers the substantive right to recover money damages from the United States, or in a lawful contract, obligating the United States to pay money.","start":394.972,"stop":411.501,"duration":16.53}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What theory do you think... which of those two do you think the court of appeals proceeded on here?","start":411.501,"stop":416.738,"duration":5.24}]},{"speakerName":"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"I think the court clearly proceeded on the contract theory, although it relied purely upon regulations.","start":416.738,"stop":422.459,"duration":5.72},{"text":"It did so because the regulations at issue do not create the right to recover money damages in court, nor do the statutes.","start":422.459,"stop":431.147,"duration":8.69},{"text":"And the statutes and regulations involved are the very ones that were before this Court in Hopkins.","start":431.147,"stop":436.299,"duration":5.15},{"text":"And in that case, they were not found to supply a waiver of sovereign immunity.","start":436.299,"stop":440.77,"duration":4.47},{"text":"So, the court was relegated to the contract theory.","start":440.77,"stop":443.789,"duration":3.02},{"text":"But in finding the existence of a contract, it relied solely on regulations.","start":443.789,"stop":449.026,"duration":5.24},{"text":"And for that reason, we think the court was wrong.","start":449.026,"stop":451.543,"duration":2.52},{"text":"The decision in this case, though, as Justice Rehnquist's question points out, is whether or not Mr. Sheehan was ever employed pursuant to contract.","start":451.543,"stop":462.701,"duration":11.16},{"text":"And as I said, the court of appeals found what it termed a collateral implied-in-fact contract.","start":462.701,"stop":468.521,"duration":5.82},{"text":"But that simply cannot be correct.","start":468.521,"stop":470.956,"duration":2.44},{"text":"First, it is squarely inconsistent with Hopkins.","start":470.956,"stop":474.158,"duration":3.2},{"text":"In Hopkins, as here, an employee of AAFES brought suit under the Tucker Act for money damages, claiming among other things that his discharge violated AAFES regulations and the due process clause.","start":474.158,"stop":487.982,"duration":13.82},{"text":"This Court carefully analyzed the regulations governing employment by AAFES and concluded not that all AAFES employees work under a collateral implied-in-fact contract; on the contrary, the Court concluded that most AAFES employees... in fact, almost all AAFES employees... are appointed to their positions, just like regular federal employees.","start":487.982,"stop":510.764,"duration":22.78},{"text":"Thus, Hopkins cannot be reconciled with the court of appeals' decision.","start":510.764,"stop":515.066,"duration":4.3},{"text":"The court of appeals' decision is also inconsistent with AAFES' own regulations, even though the court relied solely on those regulations in reaching its conclusion.","start":515.066,"stop":525.191,"duration":10.13},{"text":"AAFES' regulations... again, as noted in Hopkins, expressly prohibit the Service from entering into an employment contract with one of its employees.","start":525.191,"stop":534.663,"duration":9.47},{"text":"Yet, the court of appeals' theory was that even if the commencement of Mr. Sheehan's employment was pursuant to appointment, he subsequently or simultaneously entered into a collateral implied-in-fact contract embodying AAFES discharge regulations.","start":534.663,"stop":553.807,"duration":19.14},{"text":"That simply can't be squared with the AAFES regulations as interpreted in Hopkins.","start":553.807,"stop":559.211,"duration":5.4},{"text":"Third, the court of appeals' decision is contrary to elementary principles of contract law.","start":559.211,"stop":566.715,"duration":7.5},{"text":"The court purported to find the existence of a contract implied in fact.","start":566.715,"stop":571.269,"duration":4.55},{"text":"But it is clear that the obligation it identified was, at best, a contract implied in law, or a quasi-contract.","start":571.269,"stop":579.542,"duration":8.27},{"text":"A contract implied in fact is, of course, a real contract; it is an agreement between the parties, it is based upon a meeting of the minds.","start":579.542,"stop":588.481,"duration":8.94},{"text":"It differs from other contracts only in that its existence is inferred from the parties' conduct rather than being expressed in words.","start":588.481,"stop":598.769,"duration":10.29},{"text":"A contract implied in law, on the other hand, is not a true agreement between the parties; it is merely a legal obligation imposed by a court for the purpose of doing justice, and without reference to the parties' intent.","start":598.769,"stop":612.679,"duration":13.91},{"text":"Here, the court of appeals purported to find a contract implied in fact, but looked to no facts particular to this case.","start":612.679,"stop":620.602,"duration":7.92},{"text":"It looked solely to provisions of law, AAFES' regulations.","start":620.602,"stop":625.254,"duration":4.65},{"text":"The court did not look to anything the parties had said or done or thought in 1962 when Mr. Sheehan became an AAFES employee, or in 1967 when he entered this Executive Management Program, or at anytime during his 14 years' tenure with the Service.","start":625.254,"stop":642.715,"duration":17.46},{"text":"And in fact, there were no facts, there are no facts, concerning any of those matters in the record because Mr. Sheehan failed to allege or even to attempt to prove the existence of a contract when this case was in district court.","start":642.715,"stop":656.292,"duration":13.58},{"text":"Thus, since the court of appeals looked solely to provisions of law and not to any facts particular to this case, it must follow that the obligation it identified was a contract implied in law.","start":656.292,"stop":669.016,"duration":12.72},{"text":"And there is no Tucker Act jurisdiction for such obligations.","start":669.016,"stop":672.485,"duration":3.47},{"text":"Fourth, the implications of the court of appeals' decision are far-reaching, and would clearly be unacceptable.","start":672.485,"stop":680.057,"duration":7.57},{"text":"Because the court looked solely to the existence of personnel regulations in effect at the time of Mr. Sheehan's employment and discharge, I think it is fair to say that the court of appeals' decision stands for the proposition that the mere existence of personnel regulations at the time of a government employee's appointment or during his tenure is sufficient to give rise to a contractual relationship between the employee and his governmental employer.","start":680.057,"stop":708.827,"duration":28.77},{"text":"There is nothing in the court of appeals' decision confining its logic to Mr. Sheehan's case, as opposed to that of any other AAFES employee.","start":708.827,"stop":718.865,"duration":10.04},{"text":"There is nothing in the decision confining its reasoning to regulations concerning discharge procedures, as opposed to any other personnel regulations.","start":718.865,"stop":730.09,"duration":11.23},{"text":"There is nothing in the opinion confining its reasoning to AAFES or the military exchanges or the non-appropriated fund instrumentalities as opposed to any federal department or agency.","start":730.09,"stop":744.098,"duration":14.01},{"text":"And thus, under the court of appeals' logic, whenever any federal employee believes that any federal personnel regulation has been violated, he or she may bring suit for damages under the Tucker Act, claiming a violation of a so-called collateral implied-in-fact contract.","start":744.098,"stop":762.627,"duration":18.53},{"text":"That result, of course, would be inconsistent with Hopkins, it would be inconsistent with Testan, it would render the Back Pay Act superfluous, and it would eliminate large chunks of the federal government's sovereign immunity without Congress' consent.","start":762.627,"stop":777.821,"duration":15.19},{"text":"Mr. Sheehan's briefs, I believe, ask this Court to affirm the decision of the court of appeals on alternative grounds, if the Court concludes that the court of appeals' reasoning was unsound.","start":777.821,"stop":792.231,"duration":14.41},{"text":"Mr. Sheehan asks this Court to find that he entered into an express or an implied contract when he entered the Executive Management Program.","start":792.231,"stop":801.519,"duration":9.29},{"text":"However, as I noted, he failed to allege or even to attempt to prove the existence of this express or implied contract when the case was in district court.","start":801.519,"stop":811.708,"duration":10.19},{"text":"In addition, AAFES regulations, as I noted, forbid the agency from entering into an employment contract with one of its own employees.","start":811.708,"stop":821.083,"duration":9.38},{"text":"Now, since executives, senior executives, entering the Executive Management Program are already AAFES employees, it must follow that a contractual relationship is not formed upon entry into that program or the regulation would be routinely violated.","start":821.083,"stop":837.01,"duration":15.93},{"text":"Third, it is apparent from the fact of the regulations concerning the Executive Management Program, that a contractual relationship is not created.","start":837.01,"stop":846.215,"duration":9.21},{"text":"Those regulations specify that one enters the program by nomination, selection and designation rather than through the formation of a contract.","start":846.215,"stop":855.671,"duration":9.46}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Alito, if we were to agree with you, do we have to remand the case so that
