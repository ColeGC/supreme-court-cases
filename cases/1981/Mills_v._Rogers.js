ready.","start":6.754,"stop":22.013,"duration":15.26}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in argument today I would like to focus on what the defendants believe to be the two fundamental reasons that there is no constitutional right to refuse treatment.","start":22.013,"stop":36.189,"duration":14.18},{"text":"First would be that allowing one patient to refuse treatment is necessarily going to negatively impair the state's ability to perform its legitimate objective of maintaining order in its hospitals, and second of all, of treating those patients who are not themselves refusing treatment.","start":36.189,"stop":57.77,"duration":21.58},{"text":"In other words, what I am saying is that to allow one patient to refuse treatment, there will necessarily be an increase of violence in our institutions.","start":57.77,"stop":68.227,"duration":10.46},{"text":"The First Circuit talks about allowing forced medication for emergency situations, but they simply do not focus on the fact of the unpredictability of violence in mentally ill patients, the impulsivity of violent acts, the fact that mental patients are acting upon irrational thoughts, and that this simply cannot always be predicted.","start":68.227,"stop":93.026,"duration":24.8},{"text":"The second--","start":93.026,"stop":94.026,"duration":1}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, they did give you a broader mandate than Judge Toro had done, didn't they?","start":94.026,"stop":99.53,"duration":5.5}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"--There is no doubt that the First Circuit opinion in our mind is less wrong than the district court opinion.","start":99.53,"stop":105.917,"duration":6.39},{"text":"I could say that maybe less people will be hurt under the First Circuit opinion than would be hurt under the district court opinion.","start":105.917,"stop":114.206,"duration":8.29},{"text":"I hardly feel that justifies the opinion.","start":114.206,"stop":117.241,"duration":3.03},{"text":"The second point that I want to make as to this first fundamental reason is that if you allow one patient to remain in your hospital in a deteriorated state, this is going to affect the health of other patients, whether or not there is violence.","start":117.241,"stop":130.732,"duration":13.49},{"text":"A hospital is a milieu setting, and if you have patients who are deteriorated, this will set off the illnesses of other patients, and I will talk about this more later.","start":130.732,"stop":141.689,"duration":10.96},{"text":"The second major point that I want to discuss in argument today which we believe to be a second fundamental reason is that we suggest that the original decision to commit an individual against his will for treatment purposes when it is known at the time that the patient is committed that antipsychotic medications are a necessary part of the treatment of the vast majority of the seriously mentally ill acts as a sufficient predicate for the later administration of this medication against the patient's will after the commitment.","start":141.689,"stop":177.796,"duration":36.11},{"text":"In other words, let me just reword what we consider this basic argument to be all about.","start":177.796,"stop":183.016,"duration":5.22},{"text":"There is no determination of incompetency at the time that a patient is committed, yet the state is empowered, despite this lack of a finding of incompetency, is empowered to commit an individual against his will for treatment.","start":183.016,"stop":201.762,"duration":18.75},{"text":"We suggest similarly without any finding of incompetency the state should be empowered to carry out that treatment against the patient's will which was ordered at the time of commitment.","start":201.762,"stop":214.403,"duration":12.64},{"text":"In order to fully understand these two fundamental arguments that we believe necessitate there being a finding of no right to refuse treatment, I think it is first necessary to focus very, very briefly on what exactly is the role of antipsychotic medications in our state hospitals.","start":214.403,"stop":231.097,"duration":16.69},{"text":"The record in this case is clear that antipsychotic medications are a necessary part of the treatment for the vast majority of seriously mentally ill patients.","start":231.097,"stop":243.255,"duration":12.16}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Do those drugs have a component of tranquilizer in

tranquilizers.","start":246.041,"stop":249.059,"duration":3.02},{"text":"You shouldn't use them and it wouldn't be proper practice to use them as a tranquilizer.","start":249.059,"stop":252.695,"duration":3.64},{"text":"They are a poor tranquilizer, and to the extent that they do tranquilize, the sedative effects wear off in two or three weeks.","start":252.695,"stop":258.515,"duration":5.82},{"text":"If you want to tranquilize, there are other drugs which are tranquilizers.","start":258.515,"stop":262.385,"duration":3.87},{"text":"We are talking about a specific group of patients, and it must be recognized, and that group of patients are patients who are so seriously mentally ill that they could be committed, plus it is acceptable medical practice to use antipsychotic medications for those patients.","start":262.385,"stop":279.195,"duration":16.81}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Schultz, do you disagree

mind-altering.","start":290.486,"stop":293.772,"duration":3.29},{"text":"What they do is restore a chemical imbalance in the brain to the original balance.","start":293.772,"stop":299.925,"duration":6.15},{"text":"It is the psychosis that is mind-altering, as I think a very cogent article points out.","start":299.925,"stop":305.745,"duration":5.82},{"text":"The non-conformist treated of his illness, the psychotic non-conformist will remain a non-conformist.","start":305.745,"stop":312.068,"duration":6.32},{"text":"A conformist treated of his illness will remain a conformist.","start":312.068,"stop":314.501,"duration":2.43},{"text":"They don't alter the mind.","start":314.501,"stop":315.853,"duration":1.35},{"text":"The psychosis alters the mind.","start":315.853,"stop":317.137,"duration":1.28},{"text":"As for the effects, the side effects, there are side effects, but simply put, the state's position, and I think the First Circuit so found, is that the dangers of psychosis untreated are far greater than the dangers of any of these side effects.","start":317.137,"stop":333.232,"duration":16.1},{"text":"The one other point that I can point out about the side effects is that there has sort of been a pendulum in the knowledge of these side effects.","start":333.232,"stop":339.485,"duration":6.25},{"text":"At first there wasn't much knowledge of them.","start":339.485,"stop":341.504,"duration":2.02},{"text":"Then everybody thought everything was a side effect, and now they are finding that the side effects are more limited than they thought, and are certainly more treatable.","start":341.504,"stop":348.841,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Let me turn back to the question of what these medications are all about.","start":348.841,"stop":353.828,"duration":4.99},{"text":"A point which the defendants want to emphasize is not only is the record clear that these medications are effective when taken voluntarily; the record is also overwhelming that these medications are effective when forcibly administered, the district court's finding notwithstanding.","start":353.828,"stop":372.207,"duration":18.38},{"text":"There is no way... To argue that these drugs are not administered... are not effective when administered forcibly simply ignores the tens of case histories in this case of patients who refused antipsychotic medication and deteriorated, and then against their will were forcibly medicated and improved, and there is simply no explanation for that other than the fact that these are chemicals, and they make the brain... they restore an imbalance, and this balance is restored whether or not a person voluntarily takes these medications or whether a person is forced to take these medications.","start":372.207,"stop":407.613,"duration":35.41},{"text":"Let me turn to what the Commonwealth feels is another very important point in this case, and that is the recognition that we are talking about seriously mentally ill individuals, as the patients who have been given the right to refuse medication, and specifically, what do we know about the serious mental illness which is sufficient to commit an individual?","start":407.613,"stop":430.145,"duration":22.53},{"text":"We know that an acutely psychotic patient is terrorized, in a state of panic, unbearable agony, pain, and distress.","start":430.145,"stop":439.684,"duration":9.54},{"text":"That is undisputed in the record.","start":439.684,"stop":441.168,"duration":1.48},{"text":"We know that schizophrenic patients, which are the majority of patients for whom it would be a proper practice to give antipsychotic medications, don't think rationally, that they think on their own autistic terms.","start":441.168,"stop":453.509,"duration":12.34},{"text":"We know that a classic symptom of mental illness which leads these patients to being committed is ambivalence, including ambivalence to treatment.","start":453.509,"stop":462.783,"duration":9.27},{"text":"We know that... it is undisputed in the record that many, many patients who were forcibly medicated in the past, after they were forcibly medicated, thanked the doctors for forcibly medicating them when they weren't speaking their own true mind.","start":462.783,"stop":477.376,"duration":14.59},{"text":"Now, despite--","start":477.376,"stop":478.876,"duration":1.5}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Could I ask you one

developing your argument.","start":480.911,"stop":484.197,"duration":3.29},{"text":"The institution houses both voluntarily committed and involuntarily committed persons.","start":484.197,"stop":489.767,"duration":5.57},{"text":"Is that correct?","start":489.767,"stop":490.317,"duration":0.55}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"That's correct.","start":490.317,"stop":490.851,"duration":0.53}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What is the rough proportion of the two?","start":490.851,"stop":492.903,"duration":2.05}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"I believe it is 90 percent voluntary and around 10 percent involuntary.","start":492.903,"stop":497.871,"duration":4.97},{"text":"The reason for that is that in Massachusetts the laws changed in 1970 requiring you to, even if you could commit somebody, ask them if you wanted them to come in voluntarily, because they felt there would be a benefit to patients being voluntary patients.","start":497.871,"stop":512.128,"duration":14.26},{"text":"There is not necessarily much of a difference in the illnesses between the two.","start":512.128,"stop":515.765,"duration":3.64}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Do I correctly recall that those who are voluntarily committed do have a right to refuse this treatment?","start":515.765,"stop":524.102,"duration":8.34}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"Or leave the hospital, or face a petition for their commitment.","start":524.102,"stop":526.804,"duration":2.7}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"But as a matter of fact, is something comparable to the district court or the court of appeals procedure being followed with respect to the 90 percent who are voluntarily committed?","start":526.804,"stop":535.994,"duration":9.19}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, except that many of them... it used to be felt that you could ask them to leave the hospital and if you didn't you could forcibly medicate them.","start":535.994,"stop":543.082,"duration":7.09},{"text":"Now what is happening is, after this opinion, if you feel they have to be forcibly medicated, they are making them involuntary patients.","start":543.082,"stop":550.753,"duration":7.67},{"text":"So when the patient refuses medication now, there could well be a shift in this percentage, given if the kind of opinions that the First Circuit and the district court issued would have become the law.","start":550.753,"stop":562.311,"duration":11.56},{"text":"I simply don't know the statistics as to whether or not there has been a change over the last several years.","start":562.311,"stop":566.698,"duration":4.39}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"In any event, basically what is at issue here is whether you must follow with respect to the 10 plus percent, because presumably the number would grow by reason of the circumstances you describe, whether you must follow the same procedure with respect to them that you follow with the other patients in the hospital.","start":566.698,"stop":581.625,"duration":14.93}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"I am afraid I don't understand your question.","start":581.625,"stop":584.742,"duration":3.12}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, the court has ordered you to follow certain procedures before you involuntarily administer these drugs to the 10 percent who have been involuntarily committed.","start":584.742,"stop":593.848,"duration":9.11}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"That's correct.","start":593.848,"stop":594.398,"duration":0.55}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"And as I understand it, you are applying those procedures, or substantially those procedures, as to the 90 percent of the people in the hospital.","start":594.398,"stop":602.704,"duration":8.31},{"text":"So the question is whether the 10 percent must be treated like the rest of the patients.","start":602.704,"stop":607.006,"duration":4.3}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, what they are doing with the 90 percent is saying, you have a choice of leaving, if you want, and if you don't, we are going to make you an involuntary patient.","start":607.006,"stop":612.744,"duration":5.74}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I know, but if they don't leave.","start":612.744,"stop":616.714,"duration":3.97},{"text":"If you could.","start":616.714,"stop":617.298,"duration":0.58},{"text":"You may not be able to.","start":617.298,"stop":619.583,"duration":2.28}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"That is correct.","start":619.583,"stop":620.416,"duration":0.83}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Schultz, I would like to pursue something that may be somewhat similar to Justice Stevens' question.","start":620.416,"stop":628.421,"duration":8},{"text":"As I understand it, the court of appeals required that an individualized estimation be made by the physicians in attendance of the possibility and type of violence in which the patient might engage, and the likely effects of the particular drugs on the patient, and an appraisal of the alternative means of treatment, and then if the physicians determine, having applied that standard, that the drug should be given, it may be given involuntarily.","start":628.421,"stop":665.045,"duration":36.62},{"text":"Now, I think that is what the court of appeals has said.","start":665.045,"stop":667.913,"duration":2.87},{"text":"I also believe that that is the procedure that you have outlined in your brief that you assert the state follows anyway.","start":667.913,"stop":677.186,"duration":9.27},{"text":"Is that right?","start":677.186,"stop":678.704,"duration":1.52}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen Schultz","textObjs":[{"text":"No, that is not right, because what they... first, what the court of appeals has done is, they set up two procedures for what they call dangerous patients and non-dangerous patients.","start":678.704,"stop":687.391,"duration":8.69},{"text":"What happened before the temporary restraining order, there was no decision about dangerousness.","start":687.391,"stop":694.48,"duration":7.09},{"text":"It was recognized that this was not something which was predictable necessarily for these patients.","start":694.48,"stop":699.868,"duration":5.39},{"text":"It was decided whether or not the medication was medically necessary on an individual basis, but there was never a decision made on, do I believe that because the possibility of dangerous outweighs the individual's private rights, which is what the individual decision has to be according to the First Circuit, that decision wasn't made.","start":699.868,"stop":719.612,"duration":19.74},{"text":"Yes, it was an individual determination, but the questions that were asked were quite different.","start":719.612,"stop":723.649,"duration":4.04},{"text":"I want to go back to the point of who these patients are, because I want to talk briefly, because the state, I think, has been misconstrued on this point in both courts below, on who is this competent mentally ill patient that is talked about by the two courts below.","start":723.649,"stop":741.711,"duration":18.06},{"text":"The district court found that a majority of the committed patients are capable of appreciating the benefits, the risks, the side effects of these medications.","start":741.711,"stop":755.954,"duration":14.24},{"text":"The Commonwealth suggests simply there is absolutely no basis in the record for that finding, but putting that aside, the major problem with both the district court opinion and the First Circuit opinion in this respect is that nobody discusses what they mean by such terms as appreciate, benefits, competent, or capability.","start":755.954,"stop":776.701,"duration":20.75},{"text":"And it is quite one thing to say that a patient is able to understand that there may be risks to medication and to understand that he has been told he will get better if he is given the medication, and it is quite another thing to say that a seriously mentally ill patient can appreciate the benefits of being well when by definition part of his illness is that he doesn't understand that what he is is not well, and let me make the Commonwealth's position clear here.","start":776.701,"stop":807.753,"duration":31.05},{"text":"We are not stating that a petition of commitment is the same as a legal finding of incompetency.","start":807.753,"stop":815.076,"duration":7.32},{"text":"We recognize that people may be delusional in some aspects, but clearheaded in other aspects of their
