Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:","start":12.761,"stop":16.588,"duration":3.83},{"text":"This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.","start":16.588,"stop":22.069,"duration":5.48},{"text":"It involves the proper scope of an employment discrimination class action.","start":22.069,"stop":28.192,"duration":6.12},{"text":"The Petitioner, General Telephone, challenges the so-called across the board approach to class certification of the Fifth Circuit.","start":28.192,"stop":37.157,"duration":8.96},{"text":"Under that approach the claims of applicants, employees and former employees can all be litigated in a single class action as long as the Plaintiff alleges that he and members of the class belong to the same race, sex or ethnic group and that each of them has suffered in some way from an employer's discrimination against their group.","start":37.157,"stop":63.584,"duration":26.43},{"text":"The facts of this case vividly illustrate why that approach is wrong.","start":63.584,"stop":70.503,"duration":6.92},{"text":"The Plaintiff, Mariano Falcon, an employee of General Telephone, charged that he was not promoted to a management job because he was a Mexican-American.","start":70.503,"stop":82.702,"duration":12.2},{"text":"In the civil action that followed, Falcon also sought to represent a class of Mexican-Americans who had applied for work at General Telephone but had not been hired.","start":82.702,"stop":97.228,"duration":14.53},{"text":"Without holding a hearing or stating any factual support for its action, the trial court certified Falcon as the sole representative of this class of unsuccessful applicants.","start":97.228,"stop":112.204,"duration":14.98},{"text":"It did so despite the existence of facts which the company contends should have resulted in a denial of class certification.","start":112.204,"stop":123.217,"duration":11.01},{"text":"For example, Mr. Falcon had never been an unsuccessful applicant at General Telephone.","start":123.217,"stop":129.948,"duration":6.73},{"text":"Indeed, he was hired when he first applied as part of the company's affirmative action program.","start":129.948,"stop":138.367,"duration":8.42},{"text":"Moreover, Falcon's promotion claim was based on a disparate treatment theory of discrimination, while the hiring claims he presented for the class were based on disparate impact.","start":138.367,"stop":153.033,"duration":14.67},{"text":"And the evidence which he introduced in support of his own promotion claim was entirely unrelated to the hiring claims of the unsuccessful applicant class.","start":153.033,"stop":165.497,"duration":12.46},{"text":"Finally, there was a conflict in interest of Falcon and the applicant class, because increasing the number of Mexican-Americans employed at General Telephone would have reduced Falcon's own chances of receiving the management promotion he sought.","start":165.497,"stop":186.909,"duration":21.41},{"text":"On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the class certification.","start":186.909,"stop":193.672,"duration":6.76},{"text":"In so doing, it expressly relied on its own policy favoring across the board class actions in employment discrimination cases.","start":193.672,"stop":206.136,"duration":12.46},{"text":"The court held that the fact that Plaintiff's claims and the class claims were both based on alleged discrimination against Mexican-Americans outweighed the differences in the employment practices that Falcon and the class were complaining of.","start":206.136,"stop":225.189,"duration":19.05},{"text":"The court did declare that there was a similarity of interests between Falcon's claims and those of the class based upon job location, job function, and other considerations.","start":225.189,"stop":242.136,"duration":16.95},{"text":"But it's clear from the record that the jobs that were included and those sought by the applicants went far beyond the management job which Falcon was complaining of not being promoted to, and there is no indication in the court's opinion or in the record as to what other considerations may have been similar between Falcon's claim and those of the applicant class.","start":242.136,"stop":273.062,"duration":30.93},{"text":"General Telephone contends that Mr. Falcon is not a proper representative of an unsuccessful applicant class, for three reasons.","start":273.062,"stop":287.571,"duration":14.51},{"text":"First, Falcon's promotion claim was not typical of the hiring claims of the unsuccessful applicant class.","start":287.571,"stop":298.536,"duration":10.96},{"text":"This Court said in General Telephone of the Northwest against EEOC that typicality limits the claims of the class to those that are fairly encompassed in the representative's personal claim.","start":298.536,"stop":316.793,"duration":18.26},{"text":"That certainly was not true here.","start":316.793,"stop":319.214,"duration":2.42},{"text":"Falcon's claim was based on a disparate treatment theory, while the hiring claims were based on disparate impact.","start":319.214,"stop":329.227,"duration":10.01},{"text":"And the evidence he introduced in support of his own claim was entirely unrelated to the claims of the applicant class.","start":329.227,"stop":338.677,"duration":9.45},{"text":"And so we say that there's no typicality as required under Rule 23(a)(3).","start":338.677,"stop":344.002,"duration":5.32},{"text":"Indeed, the differences between Falcon's promotion claim and the hiring claims of the class are so great that we contend that in this action there is not even the necessary common issues of fact or law required by Rule 23(a)(2).","start":344.002,"stop":366.477,"duration":22.47},{"text":"And finally, because of these differences between the claims of the putative class representative and the class and because of the conflict that we have referred to in the interests of Falcon and the class, we contend that Falcon is not an adequate representative as required under Rule 23(a)(4).","start":366.477,"stop":394.715,"duration":28.24},{"text":"Let me restate at this time what the Petitioner is seeking in this action and what he is not seeking, what it is not seeking.","start":394.715,"stop":407.632,"duration":12.92},{"text":"First, General seeking, Telephone is seeking in this action the careful application of the elements of Rule 23 that this Court said was required in its decision in Rodriguez.","start":407.632,"stop":425.516,"duration":17.88},{"text":"We're not seeking a per se rule that under no circumstances can an employee ever include applicants in a class action which he is bringing.","start":425.516,"stop":440.212,"duration":14.7},{"text":"If there is a common policy that similarly discriminates against both employees and applicants, if there is sufficient numerocity and if there is no conflict in interest, then it would be possible for an employee to represent an applicant.","start":440.212,"stop":462.657,"duration":22.44},{"text":"But those elements are not present in this case.","start":462.657,"stop":465.062,"duration":2.41},{"text":"And that is the second thing that we are seeking, which is the careful application of Rule 23 to this case, and we say if there is such a careful application it will be clear that Mr. Falcon--","start":465.062,"stop":482.117,"duration":17.06}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Powers, are you taking the same position the Government

questions.","start":498.049,"stop":505.248,"duration":7.2},{"text":"We think that their argument is similar to ours.","start":505.248,"stop":510.794,"duration":5.55},{"text":"As we indicated in our reply brief, while we think there is a lack of common questions here, we think that certainly there is a lack of typicality.","start":510.794,"stop":520.57,"duration":9.78},{"text":"But however the Court chooses to define the defect, we think it clear, as the Government does, that the Fifth Circuit and the court below did not require the necessary symmetry of

initial certification was wrong, and that the proper remedy here or the proper action for this Court is as the Court acted in Rodriguez, which is to reverse with instructions to dismiss the unsuccessful applicants from the class.","start":550.683,"stop":580.328,"duration":29.64},{"text":"Finally, we think it clear that the careful application of Rule 23 that we seek in this case will not mean the end of employment discrimination class actions.","start":580.328,"stop":599.725,"duration":19.4},{"text":"As I said earlier, when there is the proper identity of interests, where a policy is being attacked that affects various groups of employees and at various locations, Rule 23 would support a broad class action.","start":599.725,"stop":619.187,"duration":19.46},{"text":"But we contend that there is not a basis for such a certification in this case and that the Court should direct the lower court, the trial court, to dismiss the unsuccessful applicants from this class and then

Perdine.","start":619.187,"stop":648.816,"duration":29.63}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Powers, are you asking for any more than the application of the traditional rule that a
