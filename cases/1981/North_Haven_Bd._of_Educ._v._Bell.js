Burns granted North Haven's motion for summary judgment, and held the regulations in question void, invalid, and of no effect whatsoever, and granted an injunction prohibiting further investigation by HEW.","start":155.283,"stop":170.21,"duration":14.93},{"text":"The Trumbull litigation followed a similar path, and the Department of Justice appealed both cases to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, where they were consolidated.","start":170.21,"stop":179.149,"duration":8.94},{"text":"The cases were held in abeyance pending a decision by this Court on three petitions for writs of certiorari filed by Justice Department from three court of appeals decisions that, similar to Judge Ellen Burns' decision, had held the regulations invalid.","start":179.149,"stop":193.641,"duration":14.49},{"text":"When those petitions were denied, the cases were reactivated and heard by the Second Circuit.","start":193.641,"stop":199.379,"duration":5.74},{"text":"At that time there were 15 court decisions in various district courts and courts of appeals, all holding these regulations invalid.","start":199.379,"stop":208.151,"duration":8.77},{"text":"The Second Circuit, however, reversed the decision of the district court and upheld the validity of those regulations.","start":208.151,"stop":215.239,"duration":7.09},{"text":"It is our position that an analysis of the legislative scheme of Title 9 in its entirety, of the statutory language of Sections 901 and 902, and the legislative history all establish that employees in general are not among the class protected by Section 901.","start":215.239,"stop":235.402,"duration":20.16},{"text":"The Department of Education has recently indicated its agreement with that position.","start":235.402,"stop":240.789,"duration":5.39},{"text":"The genesis of what became Title 9 were hearings, extensive hearings held before the House of Representatives in 1970, and at that time two problems were brought to its attention.","start":240.789,"stop":253.53,"duration":12.74},{"text":"One was sex discrimination in employment against women employed in educational institutions, and at that time Title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act explicitly excluded women... excluded educational institutions from its parameters.","start":253.53,"stop":272.66,"duration":19.13},{"text":"The Equal Pay Act at that time excluded people in positions of executive, professional, and academic.","start":272.66,"stop":280.433,"duration":7.77},{"text":"That would also work to the detriment of women faculty members of educational institutions.","start":280.433,"stop":286.753,"duration":6.32},{"text":"So, thus there was one very special problem of women employees of educational institutions who were victims of sex discrimination and who were not protected by Title 7 of the Equal Pay Act.","start":286.753,"stop":298.978,"duration":12.23},{"text":"Another problem that was brought to Congress's attention was the problem of student beneficiaries who were also or might also be victims of sex discrimination and who were not protected by Section 601 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a section that protected beneficiaries of federal financial assistance from race, color, or national origin discrimination, but did not prohibit sex discrimination.","start":298.978,"stop":325.212,"duration":26.23},{"text":"Growing out of these hearings was the bill that became Title 9, which very explicitly addressed the problem of women employees by amending Title 7 to remove that exemption for employees of educational institutions, and by amending the Equal Pay Act to remove the exemption for academic, professional, and executive positions.","start":325.212,"stop":348.059,"duration":22.85},{"text":"So, employees of educational institutions now have federal forums, federal agencies that could investigate their claims and could go into federal court pursuant to those statutes.","start":348.059,"stop":359.866,"duration":11.81},{"text":"The problems of student beneficiaries were addressed in what became Section 901 of Title 9.","start":359.866,"stop":367.205,"duration":7.34},{"text":"The section that was enacted prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities.","start":367.205,"stop":371.943,"duration":4.74},{"text":"That Section 901 language was chosen over other proposals that had been suggested to Congress.","start":371.943,"stop":382.399,"duration":10.46},{"text":"One proposal by the Department of Justice had suggested that instead of amending Title 7 in the Equal Pay Act to protect employees of educational institutions, HEW should be given that jurisdiction, and it proposed what would have been comparable to Section 901(a), a general prohibition against discrimination of beneficiaries, and explicitly would have given jurisdiction over employment to HEW.","start":382.399,"stop":408.982,"duration":26.58},{"text":"That proposal, however, was not adopted.","start":408.982,"stop":411.918,"duration":2.94},{"text":"Similarly, Senator McGovern had proposed a bill that would have first banned general discrimination against beneficiaries in educational programs, and again would have explicitly covered employment.","start":411.918,"stop":423.792,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Those proposals were not adopted.","start":423.792,"stop":426.178,"duration":2.39},{"text":"What was adopted was the scheme to protect employees under Title 7 in the Equal Pay Act, and to protect student beneficiaries under Section 901.","start":426.178,"stop":436.366,"duration":10.19},{"text":"The statute then is clearly addressed to those beneficiaries.","start":436.366,"stop":440.837,"duration":4.47},{"text":"The exceptions to Section 901 are also all addressed to the student relationship.","start":440.837,"stop":448.007,"duration":7.17},{"text":"They address admissions to educational institutions, certain programs or activities that would affect students, or exempt institutions in their entirety.","start":448.007,"stop":458.232,"duration":10.23},{"text":"Nothing related to employment is under Section 901.","start":458.232,"stop":462.451,"duration":4.22},{"text":"When Congress does address employment, it has put certain exceptions into the statute.","start":462.451,"stop":467.938,"duration":5.49},{"text":"Title 7, for example, makes an exception for bona fide occupational qualification, or for a national security exemption.","start":467.938,"stop":476.71,"duration":8.77},{"text":"Those exceptions were missing from the Section 901 exceptions, further indication that employment was not covered in that general prohibition to protect students.","start":476.71,"stop":488.068,"duration":11.36},{"text":"The HEW regulations in question, however, go much further than the statutory language.","start":488.068,"stop":494.488,"duration":6.42}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Ms. Krell, how do you deal with the fact that Title 9 was patterned after Title 6, and Title
