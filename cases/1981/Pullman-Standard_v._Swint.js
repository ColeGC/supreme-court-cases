disparate impact, and what that meant was, and this was the point the district court found absolutely most important in his analysis, what that meant was, when a union organized a plant, a large plant

have negotiated a system that would not have disparate impact.","start":710.99,"stop":747.179,"duration":36.19},{"text":"To choose to have a seniority system meant that you were going to have a system

universal in American industry.","start":768.577,"stop":772.98,"duration":4.4},{"text":"Every union upon negotiating every plant, the first thing it wants, even before a wage increase, is a seniority system, because that is the most important things that employees want for job equity.","start":772.98,"stop":783.852,"duration":10.87},{"text":"And it is not possible in the face of a history of discriminatory assignments to negotiate however innocently a seniority system that doesn't have a disparate impact.","start":783.852,"stop":795.744,"duration":11.89},{"text":"Now, it happens that among the choices that innocently motivated people in plants make, if you look at all white plants where race couldn't be a factor, in the north, there are a number of kinds of systems people could adopt.","start":795.744,"stop":807.785,"duration":12.04},{"text":"They could adopt a job seniority system with a line of progression.","start":807.785,"stop":811.253,"duration":3.47},{"text":"They could adopt line of progression seniority.","start":811.253,"stop":814.938,"duration":3.68},{"text":"The widest kind of seniority anybody ever adopted anywhere was departmental seniority without lines of progression, the very thing which these parties negotiated here, right in 1941.","start":814.938,"stop":829.698,"duration":14.76},{"text":"So these parties adopted the broadest system of seniority that had the least disparate impact of any conceivable system they might reasonably have been expected to choose, and the district court said, how can I find bad motive when I find these parties adopting what is in fact the broadest possible system anybody could have been expected to adopt.","start":829.698,"stop":852.73,"duration":23.03},{"text":"Now, that, I think, indicates what is the danger of placing undue emphasis on evidence of disparate impact in measuring seniority systems, and this would be true of a post Act system as well, if the union came along tomorrow and organized a plant that still had the effects of an employer's historical discrimination.","start":852.73,"stop":874.493,"duration":21.76},{"text":"Simply to choose to have a seniority system is to create
