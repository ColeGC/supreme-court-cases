to benefits under Blue Shield contracts.","start":88.872,"stop":100.763,"duration":11.89},{"text":"This plaintiff was an employee of Prince William County.","start":100.763,"stop":105.648,"duration":4.88},{"text":"Prince William County had a contract for medical services which they purchased from Blue Shield of Virginia.","start":105.648,"stop":114.487,"duration":8.84},{"text":"Plaintiff was treated by a clinical psychologist, and sought reimbursement from Blue Shield of Virginia.","start":114.487,"stop":123.426,"duration":8.94},{"text":"That is the gist of the complaint.","start":123.426,"stop":126.747,"duration":3.32},{"text":"She wishes to be reimbursed.","start":126.747,"stop":128.197,"duration":1.45},{"text":"Her request for reimbursal was refused on the grounds that the plan only covered physician's services and other allied health services which are supervised by and billed through a physician.","start":128.197,"stop":144.173,"duration":15.98},{"text":"The case is complicated by the fact that there was another case filed at the same time.","start":144.173,"stop":152.712,"duration":8.54},{"text":"They started out being heard together, and one was decided last year by the Fourth Circuit.","start":152.712,"stop":159.884,"duration":7.17},{"text":"It is called the VACP case.","start":159.884,"stop":162.17,"duration":2.29},{"text":"In that case, the district court ruled for the Blue Shield plans and psychiatrists, but the Fourth Circuit said that there was a restraint.","start":162.17,"stop":174.061,"duration":11.89},{"text":"The restraint was in the sector or area of restraining clinical psychologists by not covering them under these contract.","start":174.061,"stop":186.785,"duration":12.72},{"text":"It was a plan that was devised, so the court held, by the two plans, two plans in Virginia, both of whom are in this case, along with the doctors and particularly the psychiatrists, to block out the clinical psychologist from being covered.","start":186.785,"stop":208.049,"duration":21.26},{"text":"Now, that is the antitrust allegation that is the base for this case brought by this patient of a psychologist.","start":208.049,"stop":221.292,"duration":13.24},{"text":"I am going to spend a little time arguing the McCarren-Ferguson point, because this Court granted certiorari on a Second Circuit case called Pireno, and it is pending here now.","start":221.292,"stop":237.134,"duration":15.84},{"text":"It is very much on our case, and if we are exempt from antitrust coverage by McCarren-Ferguson, then you wouldn't necessarily reach the other point which is antitrust injury.","start":237.134,"stop":252.994,"duration":15.86},{"text":"Unfortunately, though, the questions tie together because it has been held at one point in the case, in the district court, that there was a boycott, so if there was a boycott, then we have to get back to the same issue, target area, was Mrs. McCready in the sector or the area where the antitrust violation took place.","start":252.994,"stop":281.144,"duration":28.15},{"text":"There are three elements that must appear to have an exemption under the McCarren-Ferguson Act.","start":281.144,"stop":286.731,"duration":5.59},{"text":"First, there must be the business of insurance.","start":286.731,"stop":290.75,"duration":4.02},{"text":"Second, there has to be state regulation of the activity in question.","start":290.75,"stop":295.654,"duration":4.9},{"text":"And third, it must appear that there is no boycott.","start":295.654,"stop":300.023,"duration":4.37},{"text":"There can't be a boycott and still have coverage.","start":300.023,"stop":305.443,"duration":5.42},{"text":"They have the exemption.","start":305.443,"stop":307.979,"duration":2.54},{"text":"Now, there is no doubt there was state regulation here.","start":307.979,"stop":313.132,"duration":5.15},{"text":"That is what the lawsuit was about.","start":313.132,"stop":314.648,"duration":1.52},{"text":"The two plans would not follow the state law.","start":314.648,"stop":318.019,"duration":3.37},{"text":"They contested it, and finally lost, but they won part of the case, and that was that the Virginia Supreme Court said the statute required that they deal directly with psychologists.","start":318.019,"stop":334.862,"duration":16.84},{"text":"The Virginia Supreme Court said that that was unconstitutional.","start":334.862,"stop":337.898,"duration":3.04},{"text":"It was not corrected up until July 1, 1979, so we are talking about damages that accrued before July 1, 1979, but I don't think it is contested, the the state regulation, so if this was the business of insurance, this policy that they had that you could only get allied health or medical... health services through a doctor, if that was underwriting or spreading of the risk within the meaning of the Royal Drug case, then we have the question... we have the business of insurance.","start":337.898,"stop":378.408,"duration":40.51},{"text":"So, the only element left to be decided would be, was there a boycott.","start":378.408,"stop":384.712,"duration":6.3},{"text":"Now, the Boycott that the District Court found, Judge Bond, this is the only mention that has been made of this in all this litigation, was that there was a boycott alleged.","start":384.712,"stop":398.304,"duration":13.59},{"text":"Well, at that time, he was dealing with a motion to dismiss involving the doctors and the plans as well as Mrs. McCready's case, and I read that to mean he was talking about a boycott in this primary level or this sector between doctors and psychologists.","start":398.304,"stop":421.337,"duration":23.03},{"text":"If so, then the same answer would come from the argument I am next going to make about antitrust injury would indicate that there was no boycott, so that's why I say that the two issues tie together.","start":421.337,"stop":434.911,"duration":13.57}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Bell, I am not sure
