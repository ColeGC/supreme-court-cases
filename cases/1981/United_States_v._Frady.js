Circuit, which reversed the sentence of death for procedural improprieties, but affirmed the conviction of first degree murder.","start":99.352,"stop":112.501,"duration":13.15},{"text":"After a series of unsuccessful collateral attacks on his conviction and one successful one relating to his sentence, respondent commenced the present proceeding in 1979, nearly 16 years after he had been convicted.","start":112.501,"stop":127.667,"duration":15.17},{"text":"The challenge in this proceeding is certain instructions which were given to the jury at his trial on the element of malice, which is one of the elements of first degree murder.","start":127.667,"stop":138.944,"duration":11.28},{"text":"Now, specifically, the instructions that the court of appeals addressed were three.","start":138.944,"stop":147.674,"duration":8.73},{"text":"The first was the instruction given in Sandstrom that a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his act.","start":147.674,"stop":155.875,"duration":8.2},{"text":"The court did not rely on this instruction as a ground for reversal.","start":155.875,"stop":160.17,"duration":4.29},{"text":"I'm looking at page 27 of the Joint Appendix, and page 28.","start":160.17,"stop":164.294,"duration":4.12},{"text":"The second part of the malice instruction that was troublesome was the statement that in determining whether a wrongful act is intentionally done and is therefore done with malice aforethought... you should again bear in mind.","start":164.294,"stop":177.459,"duration":13.16},{"text":"Now, it is correct, as the District of Columbia Circuit recognized several years after its decision on Frady's original appeal, that this is an improper statement because it is not necessarily the case that an intentional act is therefore done with malice.","start":177.459,"stop":197.468,"duration":20.01},{"text":"Similarly, in discussing the significance of the use of a weapon in this case, on page 28 of the Joint Appendix, the district court said","start":197.468,"stop":206.76,"duration":9.29},{"text":"\"The law infers or presumes from the use of such weapon, in the absence of explanatory or mitigating circumstances, the existence of the malice essential to culpable homicide. \"","start":206.76,"stop":216.241,"duration":9.48},{"text":"That instruction also was disapproved by the District of Columbia Circuit in subsequent cases.","start":216.241,"stop":223.38,"duration":7.14},{"text":"No objection was made by counsel to any of these instructions.","start":223.38,"stop":228.454,"duration":5.07}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Frey, before you leave the specific instructions, do you happen to know whether these instructions were given to the jury in written form?","start":228.454,"stop":236.967,"duration":8.51},{"text":"Or were they just read orally?","start":236.967,"stop":239.747,"duration":2.78}]},{"speakerName":"Mr. Andrew L.

United States, that the standard of review of such a claim on collateral attack is plain error under Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.","start":263.144,"stop":276.497,"duration":13.35},{"text":"Secondly, it held that if the standard is not plain error, but rather the cause and prejudice standard of Davis and of Wainwright v. Sykes, then that was satisfied.","start":276.497,"stop":286.322,"duration":9.82},{"text":"The cause prong satisfied because it would have been futile to object to these instructions because they were standard at the time they were given; the prejudice prong essentially satisfied because of the court's conclusion that it was not clearly harmless error in the circumstances of this case; it might have affected the jury's verdict.","start":286.322,"stop":306.44,"duration":20.12},{"text":"Then the only remaining question in the Court of Appeals' analysis was whether the decisions in which the D.C. Circuit recognized these errors in the standard jury instructions should be applied retroactively, and the court held, relying on Hankerson v. North Carolina, that because they relate to the jury's determination of factual guilt or innocence, they do have to be applied retroactively.","start":306.44,"stop":332.491,"duration":26.05},{"text":"Now, the decision, in our view, incorporates a number of serious errors.","start":332.491,"stop":337.442,"duration":4.95},{"text":"To characterize its result, I would say that first, it completely erases the distinction between direct and collateral attack in the federal system.","start":337.442,"stop":347.876,"duration":10.43},{"text":"Secondly, it renders the requirements of contemporaneous objection in Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure a dead letter.","start":347.876,"stop":356.294,"duration":8.42},{"text":"And it attaches to each new decision altering the Rules of Evidence or the proper form of jury instructions the consequence of invalidating large numbers of prior convictions obtained before the new decision was handed down.","start":356.294,"stop":371.866,"duration":15.57},{"text":"Before I address the questions that the court of appeals addressed, I'd like to pause for a moment on the question of whether this is a constitutional or a non-constitutional error.","start":371.866,"stop":383.502,"duration":11.64},{"text":"This is something of a morass and I'm not sure that I understand it totally, but it is significant because if it's not a constitutional error, then the failure to raise this point on appeal would appear to foreclose the issue under this Court's holding in Sunal v. Large.","start":383.502,"stop":400.088,"duration":16.59},{"text":"Secondly, if it's not a constitutional error, while that does not absolutely foreclose relief under 2255, the standard announced in Davis two is that you must have a fundamental defect inherently resulting in a complete miscarriage of justice.","start":400.088,"stop":418.581,"duration":18.49},{"text":"Now, that standard, it seems to me, must be different from the harmless error standard that the court of appeals effectively applied in this case.","start":418.581,"stop":427.311,"duration":8.73},{"text":"Indeed, if the error is non-constitutional, it seems to me that the decision of the court of appeals, recognizing the error, is not significantly different from a statute that would be passed by Congress to correct what it viewed as an improper jury instruction, and I don't think anybody could seriously contend that if Congress had passed a statute in 1967, that Frady would be able to come in and invoke that statute as grounds for collateral relief.","start":427.311,"stop":453.41,"duration":26.1},{"text":"Now, I think the error here was not of constitutional magnitude, and in this connection it seems to me that the important case is Sandstrom, but what is instructive is the contrast between Sandstrom and the present case.","start":453.41,"stop":468.717,"duration":15.31},{"text":"In Sandstrom, the issue was whether the defendant, who admitted killing the victim, had intended to kill the victim.","start":468.717,"stop":480.025,"duration":11.31},{"text":"And the principal difficulty that the court found in the instruction which was a focal instruction in the case was that it may have caused reasonable jurors to believe that if his actions were such as would be likely to bring about death, then they must find Sandstrom guilty, no matter what they felt about his own state of mind.","start":480.025,"stop":502.454,"duration":22.43},{"text":"Now, many of the cases of this court, Cupp v. Naughten, Henerson v. Kibbe, United States v. Park, in discussing instructions, enjoin the examination of the instruction in the entire context.","start":502.454,"stop":517.807,"duration":15.35},{"text":"And without going into it in detail here, there was a fairly lengthy instruction on malice, and this instruction required the jury to find that there was a feeling of hatred or ill will on the part of the defendants.","start":517.807,"stop":542.592,"duration":24.78},{"text":"State of mind showing a hard regardless of social duty, a mind deliberately bent on mischief and so on.","start":542.592,"stop":549.137,"duration":6.54},{"text":"And in giving the Sandstrom instruction about the presumption that one intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts, the judge went on to say if a man uses upon another an instrument of such a nature and in such a way and under such circumstances that such use would naturally and probably result in death, then you are not compelled to presume that he intended to kill from such acts, but has the right--","start":549.137,"stop":571.488,"duration":22.35}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What are you arguing now, Mr. Frey, that there's no constitutional error?","start":571.488,"stop":574.363,"duration":2.88}]},{"speakerName":"Mr. Andrew L.
