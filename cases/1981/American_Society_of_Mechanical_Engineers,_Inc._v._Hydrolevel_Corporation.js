Boyler, a big insurance company, sat down in the Drape Hotel for dinner with some other officers of McDonald and Miller.","start":323.151,"stop":357.059,"duration":33.91},{"text":"For our purposes, the principal subject of talking was how they could use the knowledge of Hardin and James to put a letter in in the normal course or what appeared to be the normal course to the Boiler Pressure Vessel Committee of ASME and to get an answer which might help McDonald and Miller or M&M compete against Hydrolevel unfairly in the marketplace.","start":357.059,"stop":385.267,"duration":28.21},{"text":"Hydrolevel, as you will recall, at the time was a small company, had never had any commercial success, but had developed a

ASME.","start":400.697,"stop":420.362,"duration":19.67},{"text":"It came into the hands of the secretary of the committee, a man named Hoyt, who in the regular course transmitted it to Hardin, who was

visible.","start":459.284,"stop":471.981,"duration":12.7},{"text":"In any case, the loaded letter got a loaded response.","start":471.981,"stop":480.196,"duration":8.22},{"text":"And after that, the record is perfectly clear that sales representatives of M&M went out into the marketplace and used this letter unfairly to depreciate, if you will, the Hydrolevel prop.","start":480.196,"stop":493.285,"duration":13.09},{"text":"Now, I will stop there, although of course there are other facts in the record, and I am sure not only my opponents but perhaps myself will get to those, but these are really sufficient to set up the legal problem, because we contend that contrary to what the court of appeals held, these facts show that these two men, Hardin and James, or one of them, weren't acting to benefit the society at all.","start":493.285,"stop":524.194,"duration":30.91},{"text":"They quite clearly were acting to benefit another principal, McDonald and Miller.","start":524.194,"stop":529.911,"duration":5.72},{"text":"Now, to step back a moment, you will remember in the court of appeals there were two issues of liability that Hydrolevel and ASME addressed.","start":529.911,"stop":542.015,"duration":12.1},{"text":"First, Hydrolevel contended that on these simple facts, Hardin and James appeared to be acting as members of the society, and therefore somehow they had actual authority to join this anticompetitive scheme.","start":542.015,"stop":560.195,"duration":18.18},{"text":"We argued to the contrary.","start":560.195,"stop":562.258,"duration":2.06},{"text":"In addition to that, Hydrolevel said, look, if we are wrong about actual authority, later on, somehow, the society, with full awareness of what was going on, ratified what Hardin and James were up to.","start":562.258,"stop":579.235,"duration":16.98},{"text":"The court of appeals didn't really confront either of those issues.","start":579.235,"stop":583.702,"duration":4.47},{"text":"They came to an apparent authority analysis of this case, as you know, and it is something which neither side did brief at all.","start":583.702,"stop":592.776,"duration":9.07},{"text":"Now, very briefly, we contend that whether we are dealing with relevant, appropriate provisions of master and servant law or agency law, and furthermore, if you look at settled law on what it takes to have someone become a member of a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade under the Sherman Act, the court of appeals analysis just doesn't hold water.","start":592.776,"stop":625.324,"duration":32.55},{"text":"Now, you will recall that the court of appeals does refer to in its opinion a number of sections of the restatement of agency, which they say fit this case.","start":625.324,"stop":639.897,"duration":14.57},{"text":"It is interesting because those sections in the 240s, if you look in the table of contents of the restatement of agency, it is instructive to see that those are regarded by the draftsman as dealing with specific and limited torts of an agent, and thus permitting under certain circumstances tying in those agents, masters, or principals.","start":639.897,"stop":669.931,"duration":30.03}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Tyler, can I interrupt you with one question that troubles me a little bit?","start":669.931,"stop":675.367,"duration":5.44},{"text":"I think the predicate of your argument is that Hardin did not benefit ASME at all when he answered the phoney letter
