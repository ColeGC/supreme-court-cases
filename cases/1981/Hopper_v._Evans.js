this case.","start":84.867,"stop":92.021,"duration":7.15},{"text":"After the Beck decision was handed down, the Fifth Circuit reversed the denial of habeas, and held that Beck required that Evans be retried and resentenced.","start":92.021,"stop":100.794,"duration":8.77},{"text":"It did so in spite of the fact that this case is different from the Beck case in every material

co-defendant named Ritter, both of whom had just been released on parole from an Indiana prison, began a cross-country crime spree.","start":109.397,"stop":119.855,"duration":10.46},{"text":"That crime spree lasted over two months, and by their own admission, involved between two and three dozen violent felonies committed in seven different states.","start":119.855,"stop":128.211,"duration":8.36},{"text":"One of those violent felonies was a robbery they committed of a pawn shop in Mobile, Alabama, in January of 1977.","start":128.211,"stop":135.615,"duration":7.4},{"text":"It is absolutely undisputed in the record that prior to that robbery, which is the basis of this case, Evans and Ritter had discussed the possibility that one of their robbery victims might try to go for a weapon, and that they had agreed between themselves that if that happened they would kill him.","start":135.615,"stop":150.374,"duration":14.76},{"text":"When Evans and Ritter entered the pawn shop in Mobile, a man named Mr. Nassar was working behind the

counter and started crawling away.","start":157.461,"stop":161.515,"duration":4.05},{"text":"Evans thought that Nassar might be going for a gun, so he leaned over the counter and deliberately shot him to death.","start":161.515,"stop":167.317,"duration":5.8},{"text":"They then pulled another robbery in Mobile, and left that state to continue their crime spree in another state.","start":167.317,"stop":175.006,"duration":7.69},{"text":"During the crime spree, and after they had killed Nassar, Evans telephoned an FBI agent in his home town and offered to turn himself in

jury.","start":193.682,"stop":196.517,"duration":2.84},{"text":"After more robberies, Evans and Ritter were finally captured in Little Rock, Arkansas, by FBI agents in March of 1977.","start":196.517,"stop":203.906,"duration":7.39},{"text":"From the very beginning, instead of contesting his guilt, Evans admitted it and bragged about it.","start":203.906,"stop":209.893,"duration":5.99},{"text":"He confessed to the robbery and murder of Nassar and the two to three dozen other violent felonies he had committed to the FBI agent who

opportunity.","start":209.893,"stop":228.022,"duration":18.13},{"text":"Evans insisted that he wanted to be convicted and sentenced to death for the murder, and his insistence on that so frustrated

objections of his attorney, and had testified under oath to the grand jury that he had robbed and murdered Mr. Nassar, that he fully understood what he was doing, that Nassar was not the first person he had killed, and that he would kill again in the same situation.","start":255.605,"stop":272.383,"duration":16.78},{"text":"Evans also testified to the grand jury that he preferred execution over

guilty plea in the official minutes of the court, but nonetheless scheduled the case for trial, because that is the peculiar procedure in Alabama capital case guilty pleas.","start":279.37,"stop":288.826,"duration":9.46},{"text":"At the trial, the state presented overwhelming evidence of Evans' guilt, including the testimony of eye witnesses and undisputed scientific evidence.","start":288.826,"stop":296.749,"duration":7.92},{"text":"After the state had rested its case, Evans filed a written motion to plead guilty, which was accepted into evidence and
