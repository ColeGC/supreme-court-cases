Court:","start":16.61,"stop":18.878,"duration":2.27},{"text":"This case is here on Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.","start":18.878,"stop":24.381,"duration":5.5},{"text":"Petitioners seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals judgment are the Secretary of Defense and officers of the Navy and the Marine Corps.","start":24.381,"stop":31.802,"duration":7.42},{"text":"This action, which was brought by the Governor of Puerto Rico and others to enjoin the Navy's use of Vieques Island for weapons training, raised claims under a number of different statutes.","start":31.802,"stop":41.91,"duration":10.11},{"text":"But the issue for review in this Court is simply whether a district court, upon finding a violation of Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act respecting discharges of pollutants is required, regardless of circumstances, to enter an order directing the immediate cessation of the activity producing the discharge.","start":41.91,"stop":61.572,"duration":19.66},{"text":"The court of appeals read the Act as imposing such a constraint on the court's remedial discretion, and it thus held that the district court lacks discretion to enter a less extreme order requiring the Navy promptly to seek a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit, commonly termed an NPDES permit, for the intermittent discharge of pollutants into the waters of Vieques Island that are part of the principal Naval Weapons Training area for the Atlantic fleet.","start":61.572,"stop":90.422,"duration":28.85},{"text":"Petitioners submit that neither the language nor the purposes of this Act require this constraint on a district court's traditional exercise of discretion in shaping equitable relief.","start":90.422,"stop":101.128,"duration":10.71},{"text":"Indeed, the court of appeals' holding represents an unprecedented construction of the Clean Water Act, requiring an all-or-nothing approach to enforcement which would preclude any kind of credible enforcement program by EPA or by authorized state agencies.","start":101.128,"stop":116.82,"duration":15.69},{"text":"Before discussing these larger implications of the court of appeals' holding, however, I would first like briefly to summarize some of the factual findings which led the district court to conclude that the order it entered adequately vindicated the interests of the Clean Water Act.","start":116.82,"stop":130.98,"duration":14.16},{"text":"The eastern half of Vieques Island is part of what is known as the inner range of the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility headquartered at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station on the main island of Puerto Rico.","start":130.98,"stop":143.138,"duration":12.16},{"text":"Ships, planes and Marines landing in amphibious maneuvers fire at air-to-ground targets, ship-to-shore targets, and artillery targets located in narrow zone on the eastern end of Vieques.","start":143.138,"stop":154.445,"duration":11.31},{"text":"Both inert and live ordnance is used.","start":154.445,"stop":157.397,"duration":2.95},{"text":"The exercises which take place some 200 days a year are coordinated from Roosevelt Roads and from an observation point on Vieques.","start":157.397,"stop":164.903,"duration":7.51},{"text":"They are essential to the maintenance of operational qualification standards for the Atlantic Fleet.","start":164.903,"stop":170.457,"duration":5.55},{"text":"Vieques is the only location presently available in which the fleet can engage in a full range of exercises simulating the conditions of actual combat.","start":170.457,"stop":179.163,"duration":8.71},{"text":"In the course of these exercises, some of the ordnance misses the land-base targets and drops into waters within the three mile limit of Vieques.","start":179.163,"stop":188.336,"duration":9.17},{"text":"Under terms of the Clean Water Act, this is a discharge of a pollutant from a point source, requiring an NPDES permit.","start":188.336,"stop":196.774,"duration":8.44},{"text":"This is so because the definition of pollutants includes munitions, and a point source is any discrete conveyance including vessels.","start":196.774,"stop":207.063,"duration":10.29},{"text":"EPA has never developed any effluent limitation guidelines for a point source class or category of military forces conducting weapons exercises.","start":207.063,"stop":217.938,"duration":10.88},{"text":"Hence, the Navy committed no violation of any existing technology-based effluent limitation under the Act.","start":217.938,"stop":224.275,"duration":6.34},{"text":"And the district court, following the trial of some 50 days, determined that the Navy's activities did not violate any of Puerto Rico's water quality laws, that no credible evidence established that the discharges had any measurable deleterious effect on the Vieques waters, and indeed, that there was no appreciable harm to the Vieques ecology.","start":224.275,"stop":243.922,"duration":19.65},{"text":"In fact, the court concluded that the Navy's presence on Vieques had, on the whole, worked to the benefit rather than the detriment of the environment there.","start":243.922,"stop":252.276,"duration":8.35},{"text":"And this was so because the Navy had to place restrictions on a large area around the area in which the weapons training is carried on, and these restrictions limited the amount of human trespassing that had caused problems for some of the area... would have caused problems absent these restrictions.","start":252.276,"stop":272.173,"duration":19.9},{"text":"In sum, on the record there appeared to be no violation of any water quality standards or any technology-based standards, and the Navy's lack of an NPDES permit was the only apparent violation of the Clean Water Act.","start":272.173,"stop":284.747,"duration":12.57}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mrs. Stillman, I take it that the EPA was prepared to issue a permit, but was unable to do so because Puerto Rico had refused to certify compliance with local water quality

checked.","start":316.284,"stop":320.838,"duration":4.55},{"text":"And we understand that the Environmental Quality Board there will probably issue a decision on that February 26.","start":320.838,"stop":329.026,"duration":8.19}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"And if that happened, it would solve the problem.","start":329.026,"stop":331.628,"duration":2.6}]},{"speakerName":"Elinor Hadley Stillman","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, if they grant the certification I think the permit probably would issue

reports.","start":331.628,"stop":347.071,"duration":15.44}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"And also, I understand the President could give an exemption from the permit

now.","start":356.01,"stop":361.413,"duration":5.4},{"text":"Section 313 of the Act provides for a presidential exemption.","start":361.413,"stop":366.301,"duration":4.89},{"text":"There are two kinds of exemptions.","start":366.301,"stop":367.601,"duration":1.3},{"text":"There is one exemption for an effluent source of any agency, Executive Branch agency or department, for one year.","start":367.601,"stop":375.073,"duration":7.47},{"text":"It's an exemption except from Sections 306 and 307 of the Act, if the President finds it in the paramount interest of the United States to do so.","start":375.073,"stop":386.031,"duration":10.96},{"text":"There's a second exemption provision which may be given for three years.","start":386.031,"stop":390.999,"duration":4.97},{"text":"It has to be done by regulation.","start":390.999,"stop":392.768,"duration":1.77},{"text":"And this can be for weapons of the military forces and related military equipment.","start":392.768,"stop":399.539,"duration":6.77},{"text":"Now, respondents have suggested, and certainly, the court of appeals seemed to rely on this also, that the existence of this exemption provision somehow meant that the district court was denied discretion to do what it did in the case here.","start":399.539,"stop":418.166,"duration":18.63},{"text":"That this exemption provision must be the only way that you can ever allow, even for a limited time, any carrying out of military

think it's got to be understood that the exemption is not the equivalent of what the district court did here.","start":432.676,"stop":442.282,"duration":9.61},{"text":"Under the three-year exemption, the Navy would not be required to do what it will be required to do under this permit.","start":442.282,"stop":448.618,"duration":6.34},{"text":"Under the permit, if it issues, the Navy will be required to monitor, I believe, nine different, they call them parameters, but it's monitoring for rhinos like iron and acidity and so on.","start":448.618,"stop":458.391,"duration":9.77}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Mrs. Stillman, couldn't the President take care of

true.","start":574.699,"stop":575.534,"duration":0.84},{"text":"But we think that it's better to have water quality standards set by the EPA than by the Office of Management and Budget, the
