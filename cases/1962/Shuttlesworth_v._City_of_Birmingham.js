the preceding case.","start":17.321,"stop":45.202,"duration":27.88},{"text":"Now, the ordinance in this case also appears on page 2 of our brief.","start":45.202,"stop":54.043,"duration":8.84},{"text":"It is a very strong ordinance which reads, “it shall be unlawful for any person to incite or aid or abet in the violation of any law or city ordinance or any provision of state law, the violation of which is a misdemeanor.”","start":54.043,"stop":71.723,"duration":17.68},{"text":"Now, the records on which the state seeks to sustain these convictions, contained only the testimony of a Birmingham City detective, and this detective did not himself personally witness any of the facts to which he testified on this trial.","start":71.723,"stop":94.239,"duration":22.52},{"text":"He was present in the Recorder's Court when these petitioners in this case were on trial and he testified in the Circuit Court on the

Reverend Shuttlesworth did, the detective said, was that Gober and Davis, petitioners of the preceding case, testified that they took part in the sit-in demonstrations on March 31st, 1960.","start":121.336,"stop":140.649,"duration":19.31},{"text":"And that they went to Reverend Shuttlesworth's house the preceding evening and discussed sit-in

Billups was present during the discussion.","start":197.454,"stop":226.842,"duration":29.39},{"text":"What Reverend Billups said does not appear in the record at

have been reversed or the petitioners have not been convicted and their cases have been dismissed, so that to urge somebody to participate in a sit-in demonstration is not itself a violation of any
