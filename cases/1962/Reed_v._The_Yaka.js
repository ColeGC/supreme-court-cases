further and looked at Justice Holmes' decision at the decision itself, they would have found that the liability was posed on the rem, on the liability of the ships themselves.","start":741.976,"stop":754.187,"duration":12.21},{"text":"There were four vessels which were involved.","start":754.187,"stop":756.704,"duration":2.52},{"text":"Had there been in personam
