union beginning to the activities primarily of the individual business agent who was joined as a defendant and four of its grease peddler members who comprise a grease peddler committee, a sort of a self-anointed committee within, to their activities primarily over the period of time from October 1954 to the time of the complaint in May of 1959, engaged in a plan and program most extensively

union members would be permitted or authorized to pick up grease at restaurants and sell it processing houses, an arrangement and understanding that some effort would be made to stabilize or fix the

product.","start":499.954,"stop":506.524,"duration":6.57},{"text":"That the conspiracy was carried out to a considerable detail and in candor requires me to state in many instances in a most ruthless

unionization.?","start":689.253,"stop":716.541,"duration":27.29},{"text":"He said that they were not the proper subject of unionization, ?unless the evidence affirmatively showed that at the trial of

unionization.","start":777.487,"stop":785.88,"duration":8.39},{"text":"That being true, I have the power, indeed the duty, under this aggravated set of facts to perpetually not only exclude the four defendants, the 45 other peddlers who had membership in the union, but to perpetually enjoin the union from taking into membership ever in the future a self-employed grease peddler regardless of its
