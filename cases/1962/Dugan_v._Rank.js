case.","start":319.021,"stop":352.942,"duration":33.92},{"text":"The diversion of the natural flow at the San Joaquin having made no provision from those lands in the red area, gave rise to a problem

acknowledged some interference with those riparian rights.","start":420.31,"stop":428.467,"duration":8.16},{"text":"It claims to have taken them to the extent that there is interference and it denies the full amount of the interference that the plaintiffs claim.","start":428.467,"stop":439.414,"duration":10.95},{"text":"Some of the plaintiffs claim what are known as overlying rights to the underground waters which they claim were fed by the San Joaquin River.","start":439.414,"stop":448.934,"duration":9.52},{"text":"They were mostly in this area, south of the river, barely reaching to the City of Fresno.","start":448.934,"stop":458.253,"duration":9.32},{"text":"The United States, for the most part, denies that it has interfered with the overlying rights to the extent that they have

spoken off for the most part as being in the category of the owner of overlying rights.","start":472.875,"stop":485.865,"duration":12.99},{"text":"Finally, some of the plaintiffs claim appropriative rights that is to say they are not neither overlying land owners nor riparian but they claim to have taken water and put it to beneficial use in time to have acquired rights under California water

barred by the statute.","start":525.913,"stop":550.265,"duration":24.35},{"text":"But we acknowledge to the extent we'd interfered that there clearly -- we were clearly bound to recognize the rights

the real issue here isn't one of the obligation to pay, it's to whether they can tie up the project as a way of asserting their rights.","start":564.841,"stop":574.094,"duration":9.25},{"text":"The action was brought against officials of the Reclamation Bureau to seek what is called a physical solution of the plaintiff's originally riparian rights.","start":574.094,"stop":587.21,"duration":13.12},{"text":"Under California law, a riparian or overlying owner who can show that other people on the stream are interfering with the natural flow of the water, may obtain a decree restraining interference with the flow of the stream unless the junior appropriator at his own expense make some physical arrangements which will protect the superior right of the riparian owner to water to a reasonable extent.","start":587.21,"stop":619.938,"duration":32.73},{"text":"For example in the present case, which is as good as an example of a physical solution as any, the District Court enjoined the operation of Friant Dam.","start":619.938,"stop":629.179,"duration":9.24},{"text":"They said you can't use Friant Dam and required the Reclamation Bureau to release all the waters of the San Joaquin River unless the United States build a series of 10 more dams and operated them in the manner that the District Court required, describing the dams in great detail even down to gantry trains and the size of rails of the train should run on and so forth, and it provided that there should be a specified flow of water over the last dam.","start":629.179,"stop":664.197,"duration":35.02},{"text":"The individual defendants when the suit started, moved to dismiss upon various grounds, but especially on the ground that the action was in reality, one against the United States barred under the doctrine of the Larson case.","start":664.197,"stop":680.139,"duration":15.94},{"text":"When that motion was denied, the officials made a number of answers, including answers on the merits but they preserve the position which we insist upon here at all times that this was an unconsented to suit against the United States.","start":680.139,"stop":697.701,"duration":17.56},{"text":"The District Court found against the reclamation official, both on the question of jurisdiction and on the merits.","start":697.701,"stop":706.049,"duration":8.35},{"text":"It entered a decree which as I have said, enjoined the operation of Friant Dam, enjoined the transfer of water through the Madera and Friant-Kern Canals unless the United States which it recognized would have to go in, chose to build 10 additional dams on the strip of the river down the Gravelly Ford at an expense of somewhere around a million dollars.","start":706.049,"stop":737.415,"duration":31.37},{"text":"I must now I think for the purposes of clarification, turn to a second aspect of the case in the District Court.","start":737.415,"stop":747.418,"duration":10},{"text":"The City of Fresno was one of the plaintiffs in the original action seeking protection of what Fresno said were her overlying rights to the underground waters alleged by her but denied by us as coming from the San Joaquin.","start":747.418,"stop":767.418,"duration":20},{"text":"At this stage when Fresno came in, the United States was joined as a defendant or at least attempted to be joined because the United States never appeared.","start":767.418,"stop":778.002,"duration":10.58},{"text":"In addition, Fresno filed a separate complaint and intervention against both the Reclamation Bureau officials and the United States seeking a declaratory judgment that her right to take additional water from the San Joaquin River from the natural flow was superior to any rights of the United States to the waters of the San Joaquin because we had acquired assignments of rights to the waters of the San Joaquin from the State of California.","start":778.002,"stop":811.446,"duration":33.44},{"text":"Third, Fresno sought a declaratory judgment that the United States was obliged to furnish Fresno with water from Millerton Lake

foot.","start":811.446,"stop":838.715,"duration":27.27},{"text":"The District Court gave judgment against the Untied States on both these claims for a declaratory judgment.","start":838.715,"stop":846.897,"duration":8.18},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed, as to the United States, holding that there was an unconsented suit against the United States and the
