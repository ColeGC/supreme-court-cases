sitting in the Northern District of Georgia, raises two questions, the second and third questions on the merits, which were raised in the previous case.","start":46.652,"stop":64.453,"duration":17.8},{"text":"It comes before this Court on direct appeal from a judgment dismissing the Government's complaint for an injunction.","start":64.453,"stop":73.733,"duration":9.28},{"text":"The Government sought an injunction against the enforcement of the Georgia rate schedules on intrastate shipments of goods being shipped on the federal government's bill of lading.","start":73.733,"stop":88.099,"duration":14.37},{"text":"The facts are in no way in dispute.","start":88.099,"stop":90.531,"duration":2.43},{"text":"They may be summarized as follows.","start":90.531,"stop":93.236,"duration":2.7},{"text":"But there are in Georgia 25 federal military establishments and a number of civilian federal establishments.","start":93.236,"stop":102.664,"duration":9.43},{"text":"It's the obligation of the government, in a considerable number of cases when an employee is transferred from post to post for the convenience of the government, to arrange for the transportation of his goods or to reimburse him for the cost of transportation as the government may choose.","start":102.664,"stop":122.731,"duration":20.07},{"text":"The usual practice, and indeed the historic practice, has been for the federal transportation officers to arrange the shipments of these household goods.","start":122.731,"stop":134.247,"duration":11.52},{"text":"They negotiate a rate or award contracts to the lowest bidder.","start":134.247,"stop":140.92,"duration":6.67},{"text":"The property of all the employees will then be shipped on a single government bill of lading.","start":140.92,"stop":147.716,"duration":6.8},{"text":"And, by government bill of lading, I mean not only one to which the government is a party, but a government form of bill of lading which has in it, as I shall point out in more detail later, a number of clauses which are not contained in the usual uniform bill of lading or other bills of lading of that type.","start":147.716,"stop":170.764,"duration":23.05},{"text":"In 19 -- then, the property is paid for of course or the shipment is paid for by the government check in due course of which incidentally usually involves an extension of credit that would be prohibited in the case of a private shipper.","start":170.764,"stop":187.379,"duration":16.61},{"text":"In 1960, there were about 1,100 carrier shipments within Georgia of the household goods of either military or civilian personnel on these government bills of lading.","start":187.379,"stop":201.117,"duration":13.74},{"text":"The procurement activities are governed either by the Armed Forces Procurement Act in the case of property for civilian employees of the Department of Defense or the property of military personnel.","start":201.117,"stop":216.568,"duration":15.45},{"text":"They are governed by Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, which is substantially the same, in the case of shipments of the household goods of civilian personnel.","start":216.568,"stop":228.769,"duration":12.2},{"text":"I will discuss the Act and the regulations a little later.","start":228.769,"stop":233.219,"duration":4.45},{"text":"It's enough to say that in our view, they require procurement officers to obtain the lowest rates possible without regard to state law.","start":233.219,"stop":243.479,"duration":10.26},{"text":"Now, Georgia has a statute of regulating intrastate truck shipments.","start":243.479,"stop":251.054,"duration":7.57},{"text":"It appears on page -- appears on page 69 in the back of our brief, at the beginning of the appendix.","start":251.054,"stop":261.166,"duration":10.11},{"text":"Under Section 613 of their Motor Vehicle Code, the Commission is given power to proscribe just and reasonable rates, fares, and charges for transportation by motor common carriers.","start":261.166,"stop":274.543,"duration":13.38},{"text":"In another section, the Commission is given power to issue rules and regulations necessary to implement the Act and, pursuant to that power, the Commission -- the Georgia Commission has issued a regulation which appears over on page 85, that is very pertinent here.","start":274.543,"stop":296.11,"duration":21.57},{"text":"It requires all shipments to be made under a uniformed household goods bill of lading.","start":296.11,"stop":303.141,"duration":7.03},{"text":"In other words, if this applies, the government cannot adhere to the usual government form of bill of lading.","start":303.141,"stop":309.538,"duration":6.4},{"text":"And down the last sentence in Rule 15, property of two or more families or establishments will not be accepted for transportation as a single shipment.","start":309.538,"stop":320.378,"duration":10.84},{"text":"In other words, the making of a mass shipment of the household goods of 500 or 600 or more people is prohibited at least to the extent that each must be made as a separate shipment under a separate bill of lading.","start":320.378,"stop":337.99,"duration":17.61},{"text":"In July 1960, there was to be such a mass movement, although perhaps not as large as 500 or 600 employees, of employees of the Department of Public Health from Savannah to Atlanta.","start":337.99,"stop":357.369,"duration":19.38},{"text":"Now, the procurement officers of the federal government invited bids.","start":357.369,"stop":361.956,"duration":4.59},{"text":"They received 15 bids -- 13 bids.","start":361.956,"stop":365.283,"duration":3.33},{"text":"Eight of them simply quoted the Georgia rates on household goods.","start":365.283,"stop":370.422,"duration":5.14},{"text":"Five bids were below the Georgia rates and the government accepted the lowest of those bids from Consolidated Van & Storage Company.","start":370.422,"stop":380.879,"duration":10.46},{"text":"Thereupon, the Georgia Public Utilities Commission threatened to revoke the license of Consolidated Van for -- or the permit of Consolidated Van for violating the Georgia Utilities regulation.","start":380.879,"stop":396.47,"duration":15.59},{"text":"A proceeding was started before the State Commission to revoke the license despite the fact that consolidated immediately broke its contract -- or immediately sought to be excused from its contract with the government, the United States sought to intervene before the Georgia Commission but was denied the leave to intervene, and thereupon, the United States filed this bill in equity seeking to enjoin the state authorities from threatening perspective truckers with prosecution under the state law if they should bid below the state rates on government shippers.","start":396.47,"stop":435.622,"duration":39.15},{"text":"The bill sought to enjoin the enforcement of the state regulation upon two grounds.","start":435.622,"stop":442.978,"duration":7.36},{"text":"First, that it was inconsistent with the procurement statutes and policies.","start":442.978,"stop":447.635,"duration":4.66},{"text":"Second, upon the ground that it violated the implied constitutional immunity of the United States.","start":447.635,"stop":454.373,"duration":6.74},{"text":"Here as in the California case, a three-judge court was convened, the issue in due course was limited to household goods.","start":454.373,"stop":464.424,"duration":10.05},{"text":"Originally, the complaint sought to cover all shipments on government bill.","start":464.424,"stop":469.345,"duration":4.92},{"text":"Georgia took the position that her statute, for some reason that I don't understand, didn't apply to shipments of government-owned property but that it applied only to government shipments of property on behalf of its employees.","start":469.345,"stop":487.767,"duration":18.42},{"text":"As so limited, the case came before the three judges on a motion for summary judgment and judgment was entered dismissing the government's complaint.","start":487.767,"stop":499.091,"duration":11.32},{"text":"The three-judge court said that it had difficulty in distinguishing the California Public Utilities case from the Penn Dairies case but that it thought Penn Dairies case was controlled.","start":499.091,"stop":513.591,"duration":14.5},{"text":"We then brought the cases here by a direct appeal.","start":513.591,"stop":518.514,"duration":4.92},{"text":"The first question raised by the Court's order postponing argument on the question of jurisdiction is whether the Court does have direct jurisdiction on this appeal.","start":518.514,"stop":530.252,"duration":11.74},{"text":"We think it plain that it does for the reasons that I stated in the argument of the California case yesterday, that one of our two grounds for seeking an injunction against enforcement of the state law plainly raised a direct constitutional question.","start":530.252,"stop":546.979,"duration":16.73}]},{"speakerName":"William J.

important of those, being the only decision by this Court, and we think that, despite the factual difference that Justice Goldberg calls attention to, that the regulations are the same, the statute is the same, their policy is therefore the same and that this is -- Georgia statute is more of an -- more inconsistent with the policy than the California statute was because the California statute at

established is that a state is not barred from imposing nondiscriminatory tax or regulation upon one doing business with the United States merely because this would add to an -- it would impose an increased economic burden on the United States.","start":1259.427,"stop":1282.173,"duration":22.75},{"text":"In the tax field, the familiar illustration I suppose are the income taxes that the states
