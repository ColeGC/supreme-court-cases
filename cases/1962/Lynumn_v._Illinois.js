ADC.","start":239.909,"stop":255.499,"duration":15.59},{"text":"And then he said at page 35 of the record, “If we take you into the station and charge you with the offense, the ADC would be probably be cut off and you will probably lose custody of your children.”","start":255.499,"stop":271.134,"duration":15.64},{"text":"He also said that during that same conversation, he promised to recommend

promise, coerce a confession and then use that confession as evidence, that's what was substantially.","start":476.491,"stop":512.063,"duration":35.57},{"text":"And the Illinois Supreme Court answered and said that it did consider that question, the federal question.","start":512.063,"stop":522.96,"duration":10.9},{"text":"I believe I do have a copy of that order in my notes.","start":522.96,"stop":531.132,"duration":8.17},{"text":"Now, I -- we submit that the in -- inadmissibility of this confession was presented in the appeal brief just referred to before the

Illinois argues that the constitutional question was not aptly asserted in accordance with Illinois principles.","start":547.374,"stop":556.304,"duration":8.93},{"text":"He ignores the nature of the right claimed by petitioner to have been violated.","start":556.304,"stop":562.592,"duration":6.29},{"text":"You well know that a similar question was raised and passed upon by this Court in Brown versus Mississippi, 297 U.S. 276.","start":562.592,"stop":572.512,"duration":9.92},{"text":"And it said on the following words, “That contention rest upon the failure of counsel for the accused, who

proved.","start":572.512,"stop":591.004,"duration":18.49},{"text":"It is a contention which proceeds upon a misconception of the nature of petitioner's

where the counsel assigned the petitioners were competent or mistakenly assumed that their first objections were sufficient.”","start":610.84,"stop":623.514,"duration":12.67},{"text":"If the Attorney General of Illinois contends the principles of trials and appellate judicature of a state would be sufficient to withdraw from the consideration of this Court, violation of such substitute rights as

Constitution.","start":623.514,"stop":646.738,"duration":23.22},{"text":"Such preemptive rights, we submit, are inconceivable.","start":646.738,"stop":652.265,"duration":5.53},{"text":"This Court has long held that the confession obtained by promises of leniency, duress, or coercion when admitted over the objection of the defendant vitiates the whole proceeding and is a denial of the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment.","start":652.265,"stop":670.134,"duration":17.87},{"text":"It is true that in this case we didn't have the gross brutality that we have in the Brown versus Mississippi one.","start":670.134,"stop":676.617,"duration":6.48},{"text":"But this Court has also recognized the coercion of the mind is of the same nature and sometimes greater than physical violence.","start":676.617,"stop":686.439,"duration":9.82},{"text":"In Spano versus New York, 360 U.S. 315, the investigators extracts the confession from the defendant by having his close friend Bruno urged the defendant to confess.","start":686.439,"stop":700.601,"duration":14.16},{"text":"Because Bruno, who was a fledging police officer, stated to Spano, that if he didn't confess, that he would be in a bad spot, and because of a prior phone call in an admission that it had been made to Bruno.","start":700.601,"stop":715.023,"duration":14.42},{"text":"And in that case, it was held that the confession was really involuntary.","start":715.023,"stop":720.775,"duration":5.75},{"text":"And I know, Chief Justice Warren remembers it and knows in much more thoroughly than I could ever hope to.","start":720.775,"stop":727.219,"duration":6.44},{"text":"In Brown versus United States at 168 U.S. 532, there's another instance of a similar case.","start":727.219,"stop":735.82,"duration":8.6},{"text":"In this case and when I say a similar case, a case where actual brutality wasn't used.","start":735.82,"stop":743.482,"duration":7.66},{"text":"The defendant Brown was induced into incriminating himself after the police officer told him, “Brown said he saw you do the murder.","start":743.482,"stop":752.739,"duration":9.26},{"text":"I'm satisfied you do murder.","start":752.739,"stop":754.892,"duration":2.15},{"text":"You must have had an accomplice.","start":754.892,"stop":756.778,"duration":1.89},{"text":"If so, you should say so and not have the blame of this horrible crime on your shoulders.”","start":756.778,"stop":763.154,"duration":6.38},{"text":"And the incriminating statements that were made by Brown in that case were held to be involuntary.","start":763.154,"stop":770.823,"duration":7.67},{"text":"And in Rogers versus Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, the confession that the defendant gave was held to be involuntarily merely because the police had threatened to bring his arthritic wife in for interrogation.","start":770.823,"stop":788.978,"duration":18.15},{"text":"And there, the Court said, “The attention of the trial judge should have been focused on the question whether the behavior of state law enforcement officials was such as to overbear the petitioner's will to resist and bring about confession not freely self-determined.”","start":788.978,"stop":808.3,"duration":19.32},{"text":"I submit that in this case the threat was to what is -- what is dearest for a mother, the custody and the care of her two little children.","start":808.3,"stop":822.54,"duration":14.24},{"text":"And I also submit that she had a further inducement and that -- that further inducement was a promise of
