cases.","start":442.452,"stop":472.017,"duration":29.57},{"text":"And I think that brings us closer to the core of this case for the procedural device which the Commission has employed here is one which it is utilizing in this and in other pipeline rate cases in an effort to provide more promptly to consumers a measure of relief from the burdens of rates which are found to be excessive.","start":472.017,"stop":501.916,"duration":29.9},{"text":"Now, the rates of the pipeline company are aggregates.","start":501.916,"stop":507.562,"duration":5.65},{"text":"By that, I mean,

challenged by various parties to the proceeding.","start":545.6,"stop":557.753,"duration":12.15},{"text":"Characteristically, some of these issues are great complexity and require many weeks or even months of testimony, a protracted battle of the utility experts.","start":557.753,"stop":571.167,"duration":13.41},{"text":"Others will admit of more expeditious treatment.Suppose that the Commission concludes in a particular case that it may take two or more years to dispose of one these large rate cases in its entirety.","start":571.167,"stop":588.524,"duration":17.36},{"text":"But that one or two controverted issues, issues, which perhaps involved a substantial portion of the cost which are seriously disputed are susceptible of separate and much earlier disposition, can the Commission decide the one or two issues accepting for purposes of its interim decision, the remaining claims of the company assuming their correctness for the time being.","start":588.524,"stop":625.19,"duration":36.67},{"text":"In other words, if it finds that the certain elements which it have examined, certain elements of the company's claim have been overstated, can it, to that extent order refunds for the past and more important late reductions for the future?","start":625.19,"stop":646.786,"duration":21.6},{"text":"Now, as I understand our opponent's brief here, Tennessee is not urging a categorical no to that question.","start":646.786,"stop":657.869,"duration":11.08},{"text":"Rather, it seems to say that perhaps sometimes the Commission might do this but not in this case.","start":657.869,"stop":668.374,"duration":10.5},{"text":"Well, what precisely did the Commission do in this case?","start":668.374,"stop":674.506,"duration":6.13},{"text":"The increases which Tennessee proposed in October 1959, were predicated in large part upon a claim that it was entitled to a 7% overall rate of return on its net invested capital.","start":674.506,"stop":692.089,"duration":17.58},{"text":"This was in contrast to the 6% rate which the Commission had allowed Tennessee in its last completed rate case.","start":692.089,"stop":704.69,"duration":12.6},{"text":"Now, the hearings in this case began in February of 1960.","start":704.69,"stop":713.156,"duration":8.47},{"text":"The course so that it shown by this chronology sheet in the right-hand column.","start":713.156,"stop":722.224,"duration":9.07},{"text":"Tennessee at that hearing presented its direct evidence, its witnesses within cross-examined exclusively on the issue of rate of return.","start":722.224,"stop":735.473,"duration":13.25},{"text":"Thereafter, the Federal Power Commission staff and those of the interveners who wished to do so, presented their testimony on that same issue of rate of return and their experts were cross-examined.","start":735.473,"stop":750.636,"duration":15.16},{"text":"Finally, Tennessee presented its rebuttal on rate of return.","start":750.636,"stop":755.902,"duration":5.27},{"text":"When

directly.","start":785.434,"stop":796.079,"duration":10.64},{"text":"The Commission adopted this procedure over Tennessee's objections.","start":796.079,"stop":801.056,"duration":4.98},{"text":"And after hearing oral argument on the issue of rate of return, wrote an opinion in August of 1960 in which it found that 6 1/8% would be a just and reasonable return for the company.","start":801.056,"stop":819.329,"duration":18.27},{"text":"By its order, which is the order here under review, the Commission did three things.","start":819.329,"stop":828.018,"duration":8.69},{"text":"One, it disallowed the rates computed by Tennessee on the basis of the excessive 7% rate of return.","start":828.018,"stop":842.218,"duration":14.2},{"text":"Two, it directed Tennessee to file substitute rates, such rates to be effective as of the time the disallowed rates had originally gone into effect which would yield 6 1/8%.","start":842.218,"stop":861.504,"duration":19.29},{"text":"Three, it ordered Tennessee to refund to its customers the amounts which had already been collected in excess of the prescribed interim rates.","start":861.504,"stop":877.302,"duration":15.8},{"text":"In its opinion, the Commission pointed out that by permitting Tennessee to file substitute rates based on a proper rate of return.","start":877.302,"stop":889.161,"duration":11.86},{"text":"But otherwise, based in every particular on the company's own claims as to what it was
