Italian to the Italian crew members and urged them to feign sickness and not to sail.","start":584.977,"stop":596.25,"duration":11.27},{"text":"This had its effect of creating confusion on shipboard and there ensued many conversations on the shipboard which I need not detail with the same result as in the case of the Nassau that the Victoria did not sail on its cruise and it was cancelled, and the passengers were debarked by tender.","start":596.25,"stop":624.957,"duration":28.71},{"text":"Now, this proceeding was as I've said in thought in the state court to seek an injunction and indeed a

side.","start":761.504,"stop":764.715,"duration":3.21},{"text":"I find that five foreign governments have filed briefs in the Incres case and in the related cases, all of which are also, I think on my side.","start":764.715,"stop":780.109,"duration":15.39},{"text":"That is a very welcome situation and I think the presence of so many foreign governments, ones against any hasty conclusion that this Act should be construed without full regard to the interests of the foreign nations that are before this Court in the amicus briefs because -- and I join the Solicitor General in one basic and fundamental point he made.","start":780.109,"stop":813.321,"duration":33.21},{"text":"We are concerned not with the Garmon type of situation of this Court acting as the -- what has been called the empire of our federal system in adjusting jurisdiction between state and nation but we are quite the contrary engaged in the adjustment if you like of power between sovereign nations.","start":813.321,"stop":839.542,"duration":26.22},{"text":"And the presence of these -- the governments, I think it must again be emphasized.","start":839.542,"stop":849.133,"duration":9.59},{"text":"And as the Solicitor General pointed out only one nation may properly, effectively, if you like, regulate labor relations on shipboard.","start":849.133,"stop":859.747,"duration":10.61},{"text":"And here, we are concerned not with a tort law such as in the Jones Act where there is a choice of law in the private international sense that we are concerned with a comprehensive regulatory law that reaches into the most important relationship on shipboard to wit the relation between the master and the crew.","start":859.747,"stop":891.044,"duration":31.3},{"text":"We regard the Benz decision as controlling here in every respect.","start":891.044,"stop":899.341,"duration":8.3},{"text":"Frankly, I do not believe that the distinction attempted by my worthy opponent is valid.","start":899.341,"stop":909.07,"duration":9.73},{"text":"The suggestion is that in that case, the ship was only temporarily in a United States port but as Mr. Justice Black, I think inquired earlier, isn't every foreign ship that comes to our harbors in here temporarily.","start":909.07,"stop":927.089,"duration":18.02},{"text":"I believe they are.","start":927.089,"stop":928.646,"duration":1.56},{"text":"I think the reach of that decision is far deeper than that.","start":928.646,"stop":934.757,"duration":6.11},{"text":"The important point that I think I should like to stress is that the Benz case is in full conformity with the established principles of international law under which we have lived for so long.","start":934.757,"stop":958.179,"duration":23.42},{"text":"I would like to mention that because several suggestions have been made.","start":958.179,"stop":962.493,"duration":4.31},{"text":"One is sort of the notion that there is some fiction maybe about registration under the flag of Liberia.","start":962.493,"stop":971.926,"duration":9.43},{"text":"And secondly, the suggestion that there is some, perhaps some -- even the word fiction was used in connection with the matter of registry of a ship in Liberia, I think, and elsewhere.","start":971.926,"stop":990.084,"duration":18.16},{"text":"I would like to point out that the Republic of Liberia has filed a brief here in which

emphasize that because there has been some suggestions that there was something peculiar about registration under the law of that Republic.","start":1179.82,"stop":1193.25,"duration":13.43},{"text":"Frankly, I haven't the remotest this idea while these Italian owners chose to register these ships under the Republic -- flag of
