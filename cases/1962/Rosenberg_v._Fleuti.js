the 1952 Act, why he was not deportable as an alien who prior to entry was convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude, consisting of his conviction on his plea of guilty in the California

homosexual or sexual deviant, be placed in the category of a psychopathic personality.","start":322.184,"stop":370.529,"duration":48.34},{"text":"He stated on cross-examination that he had no

deportation hearing was true, in which the respondent stated that he had had homosexual urgence since he was a young man of 24 in Switzerland and that in the intervening period of 22 years, he had

August of 1959, and it acknowledged that the respondent had had homosexual activities since the age of 26.","start":566.063,"stop":597.038,"duration":30.98},{"text":"But in which he stated that the

control.","start":632.388,"stop":656.071,"duration":23.68},{"text":"The special inquiry officer at the conclusion of the hearing determined that the addition -- the additional charge had been supported because on the undisputed evidence, the respondent was and at entry had been a homosexual.","start":656.071,"stop":675.111,"duration":19.04},{"text":"And he referred to a prior decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals in which the Board, on the basis of a thorough analysis of the legislative history of Section 212 (a) (4) of the 1952 Act had concluded that Congress -- that there

unsuccessful appeal or rather the respondent following an unsuccessful appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, sued for injunctive and declaratory relief in the North -- in the District Court of

intent.","start":736.826,"stop":757.659,"duration":20.83},{"text":"The Court rejected the contention that the term ‘psychopathic personality' was unconstitutionally vague with the observation that while it might be true that a criminal statute which employed such a term might be too definite to be sustainable, too indefinite to be sustainable, the same strict standard of definiteness should not be required of a statute which merely defines the classes of aliens who are inadmissible to the country.","start":757.659,"stop":787.976,"duration":30.32},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the phrase was unconstitutionally vague as herein applied and that resort might not be had to the legislative history.","start":787.976,"stop":799.45,"duration":11.47},{"text":"The Court, while recognizing that the respondent's deportation had not been ordered on the basis of his miss of -- of any conduct in this country, but because of a disqualifying condition at the time of his entry, held nevertheless that the Immigration and Naturalization Service's reliance in part in making its finding as to the existence of that condition on behavior by the respondent in his country, made the application of Section 212 (a) (4) to his case fundamentally unfair.","start":799.45,"stop":836.983,"duration":37.53},{"text":"The Court's rationale is set forth in -- on page 96 of the

choice.”","start":836.983,"stop":861.867,"duration":24.88},{"text":"It follows that if by reason of vagueness, the statute failed to advise him that homosexual practices conclusively evidenced a
