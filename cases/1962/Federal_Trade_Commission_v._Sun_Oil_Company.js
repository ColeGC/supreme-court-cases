absolute defense.","start":337.101,"stop":359.846,"duration":22.75},{"text":"This Court decided that it was an absolute defense, but the Court concluded, I refer now to the majority opinion at the

Section 2 of the original Clayton Act.”","start":359.846,"stop":387.543,"duration":27.7},{"text":"Now from this, we make just the simple point that the Section 2 (b) proviso was meant to limit the

point too long, but it seems to me a point that we have not hitherto given sufficient attention.","start":438.812,"stop":452.35,"duration":13.54},{"text":"In normal usage, the corner jeweler selling Elgin watches for example is not a competitor of the Bulova Watch Company nor is the butcher who sells Swift & Company meats ordinarily considered a competitor of the Armor

in the statute.","start":466.837,"stop":478.484,"duration":11.65},{"text":"Simply said that in these examples, normal understanding is that it has a horizontal meaning and I point out to the Court

the amicus or either the friends of the Court has submitted any examples from the legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act, indicating debate, reports, or otherwise that any members of the
