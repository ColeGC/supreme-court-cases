ramifications.","start":35.935,"stop":56.243,"duration":20.31},{"text":"By its determination, the Commission for the second time in a decade, declined to apply the heart of the Natural Gas Act to Phillips Petroleum Corp -- Company, the largest independent producer of natural gas, supplying over 10% of the interstate market and to fix just and reasonable rates for its sales.","start":56.243,"stop":85.063,"duration":28.82},{"text":"In a 1951 determination, the Commission had declined to do so under the erroneous impression that it lacked jurisdiction over sales by

case.","start":162.52,"stop":187.205,"duration":24.69},{"text":"The Commission did, in 1960, give a form of lip service to the duty to stabilize, at, I point out immediately, 1959 and 1960 levels, not 1954 levels.","start":187.205,"stop":204.961,"duration":17.76},{"text":"It flatly refused however in the instant determination to perform its foremost function and that is why we, who have put on the

resort.","start":204.961,"stop":229.443,"duration":24.48},{"text":"Upon receipt of the remand order in 1954, the Commission entered an order vacating its prior determination of the investigative

maximum of five months after which they go into effect virtually automatically.","start":245.227,"stop":276.509,"duration":31.28},{"text":"Finally, in 1956, the Commission entered an order

changes.","start":317.583,"stop":327.334,"duration":9.75},{"text":"15 months later, on April 6, 1959, the examiner rendered a most exhaustive analysis of the record and his recommendations, for futu

multitude of Section 4 rate increase filings by Phillips and by others developing into what has come to be called a pancaking process; namely, a rate increase for one sale is filed, it goes into effect.","start":363.186,"stop":384.763,"duration":21.58},{"text":"It is in effect subject to investigation which is never instituted, settlements

amounts of money were collected by it subject to refund under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act.","start":402.018,"stop":415.839,"duration":13.82},{"text":"The period was also marked by a study upward spiral of similar nature in the initial prices for gas, new gas dedications.","start":415.839,"stop":425.422,"duration":9.58},{"text":"The Commission's rationale for permitting of this was in those days it would investigate the propriety of those prices in subsequent Section 5 proceedings like this one should be instituted against each major producer.","start":425.422,"stop":441.618,"duration":16.2},{"text":"They were instituted against virtually all of the major producing industry.","start":441.618,"stop":447.856,"duration":6.24},{"text":"The period was also marked initially by a concerted refusal on the part of producers in the Section 4 and Section 5 cases that the Commission instituted to disclose in any way shape or form their costs of operation.","start":447.856,"stop":467.355,"duration":19.5},{"text":"Their representation was that the cost-of-service method of regulating independent producers was impractical, impossible or worse and their theme was hammered to the point of redundancy.","start":467.355,"stop":484.438,"duration":17.08},{"text":"The Commission at this time and the producers were aligned in Congressional pursuits, seeking congressional exemption of the producing industry from the impact of the Natural Gas Act or at minimum, outlawing the use of cost-of-service as a method of evaluating and testing their rates, both efforts failed.","start":484.438,"stop":507.496,"duration":23.06},{"text":"Finally, during the period, there were two several marked decisions by the courts below and the Fifth Circuit holding in substance the cost-of-service was of necessity, at least the starting point, the Commission must use in order to evaluate any rates of any utility subject to its jurisdiction.","start":507.496,"stop":534.543,"duration":27.05},{"text":"Coming back to the examiner's decision, he first noted the criticism of the feasibility of the cost-of-service approach, but noted also that it had been rendered in a vacuum in that up until his decision, there had been no opportunity for applying or endeavor to apply the traditional means of evaluating the rates of an independent producer, his was the first attempt.","start":534.543,"stop":563.398,"duration":28.86},{"text":"During the proceedings, Phillips and all of the party's participants had proceeded upon the assumption that of the course this was the process that would be utilized to evaluate Phillips' rates.","start":563.398,"stop":573.211,"duration":9.81},{"text":"Phillips found no difficulty in the presentation of the case.","start":573.211,"stop":577.034,"duration":3.82},{"text":"Parties who've submitted other cost-of-service found no difficulties in the presentation of the case.","start":577.034,"stop":582.824,"duration":5.79},{"text":"The examiner exhausted -- exhaustively analyzed each of the four cost-of-service matters submitted to him and concluded that Phillips' cost-of-service for the test year 1954 was $57 million which translated in terms of a per unit cost-of-service of 11.6 cents per Mcf of gas sold.","start":582.824,"stop":614.649,"duration":31.83},{"text":"He also found that for 1954, test year revenues apart from any increases subsequently filed were $45 million resulting in a deficit operation on the surface for that particular test year.","start":614.649,"stop":635.677,"duration":21.03},{"text":"He directed Phillips to file calculated rates for all of its 1954 sales for continuing to produce the requisite 11.6 cents per Mcf average revenues for those sales, thus supplying Phillips with the full return of its entire cost-of-service.","start":635.677,"stop":664.334,"duration":28.66},{"text":"And incidentally, cost-of-service as I use it here always includes a fair return upon the actual expenses and the actual operations.","start":664.334,"stop":677.238,"duration":12.9},{"text":"He also directed that Phillips filed similar rates for all of its then current, continuing sales which would have the effect of increasing sum.","start":677.238,"stop":693.484,"duration":16.25},{"text":"Phillips' sales at that time ranged from one cent per Mcf to as high as 23 cents per Mcf depending on a particular sale.","start":693.484,"stop":705.38,"duration":11.9},{"text":"His direction would have produced a schedule of rates ranging from say 10 to 15 cents per Mcf for all of those sales.","start":705.38,"stop":718.784,"duration":13.4},{"text":"Hence, some would have forced -- have been increased many, a great bulk of this rate increase filing subsequent to 1956.","start":718.784,"stop":728.881,"duration":10.1},{"text":"Iis range as I've indicated, the 23 cents would have been reduced.","start":728.881,"stop":737.054,"duration":8.17},{"text":"Phillips submitted after the examiner's decision was rendered a schedule of rates which as I've indicated started with a maximum of 15 cents and tapered down, indicative that the direction was quite feasible.","start":737.054,"stop":750.512,"duration":13.46}]},{"speakerName":"Hugo L.

initial determination of just and reasonable rates for producers.","start":756.843,"stop":772.979,"duration":16.14},{"text":"Its opinion like the examiner starts off with an analysis of the theory of regulation of independent producers and unlike the examiner, however, deals with the numerous representations of impracticality, endorses the representations wholeheartedly and finds the system of cost-of-service analysis for independent producers not a feasible means of fixing their rates.","start":772.979,"stop":806.666,"duration":33.69},{"text":"Preferring to adopt and test such rates on an

producers, area ratemaking process.","start":806.666,"stop":834.438,"duration":27.77},{"text":"Simultaneously with that pronouncement of preferred process which as I've pointed out was an entirely noble one, the Commission issued its statement of General Policy Number 61-1 in which it defined and prescribed 23 separate areas of the country and pulling them out of the thin blue air, if you please, this promulgation was without notice, without hearing, without evidence, prescribed two levels of rates for each of the 23 areas with decimal precision.","start":834.438,"stop":876.156,"duration":41.72},{"text":"The first group was to be a guide to the Commission in the certification of new gas dedications under Section 7 and an indication

the area of initial price level, absent a demonstration of why he should have more.","start":876.156,"stop":909.871,"duration":33.72},{"text":"The second group of prices was prescribed for guidelines

proceedings which had been superseded as to which the interest was primarily involving the necessity for Phillips to affect refunds of any excess over the just and reasonable rates for the period, the

higher ones and hence, dismissed that -- those proceedings as well.","start":1164.73,"stop":1205.721,"duration":40.99},{"text":"The Commission knew, it indicated in its opinion that it was cognizant

consolidated in the pending proceeding from which it knew that in 1960, Phillips was deriving revenues of approximately $90 million of which -- and of these it took pride purportedly of which the

refund.","start":1205.721,"stop":1268.969,"duration":63.25},{"text":"This was the means by which the Commission said, “We are able to protect the public as to these tremendous increases pending the
