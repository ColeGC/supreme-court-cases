before you gentlemen is the question of freedom of speech whether or not these petitioners were exercising any right of freedom of speech when they staged this “sit-in” demonstration.","start":12.501,"stop":29.986,"duration":17.49},{"text":"We submit that they were not.","start":29.986,"stop":32.043,"duration":2.06},{"text":"First, of all in considering the question of freedom of speech, you have to consider where the traditional area for speech in public speaking has taken place in this country and we found on looking at cases that the traditional area of speech where you have people who -- to begin with or not (Inaudible) to speak in detail, as between the associates or friends in a private discussion, is that they have to meet in the public places for that discussion, that is on the streets, in the park, in the places where ordinary people would come together who had something that they wished to talk about.","start":32.043,"stop":70.151,"duration":38.11},{"text":"Then we think it's proper that people should have the freedom to speak to each other and try to convince others of their views when they meet on public places, in a place like that, and we think they have a right go there to try to convince others of their thoughts, of their ideas.","start":70.151,"stop":89.509,"duration":19.36},{"text":"You go a step further, however, when you have a person who wishes to try to convince someone else of his ideas and thoughts when he goes onto that man's private property to do so, and that's what you have in this case.","start":89.509,"stop":103.007,"duration":13.5},{"text":"The petitioners who claimed they were exercising the right of speech had left the traditional area of speech which is out in the public and out in the open and they have gone inside the store where they now seek to speak not to the other public in general, not to someone who may be by chance coming down the street, but where they had seek to speak to the owner or the manager or the operator of these particular premises.","start":103.007,"stop":129.598,"duration":26.59},{"text":"So they have narrowed down in two ways from first, they have moved away from the traditional area of speech.","start":129.598,"stop":137.103,"duration":7.5},{"text":"And second, they have moved in and they have narrowed their desire to speak to a particular person and not to speak to anyone in

away.","start":199.064,"stop":213.48,"duration":14.42},{"text":"For example, in Cantwell against Connecticut, you had a speech problem with the persons that -- where they would be listeners after they

question with them any further, and he asked them to proceed about their own business somewhere else.","start":254.473,"stop":282.409,"duration":27.94},{"text":"That was his right.","start":282.409,"stop":283.433,"duration":1.02},{"text":"He didn't have to sit there and listen to their demands hour after hour.","start":283.433,"stop":288.011,"duration":4.58},{"text":"When
