lets the matter run on that it has any way to protect itself beyond that point because we can't let him pay the taxes before but we can let him take taxes before the federal lien arises and back to the mortgage.","start":714.172,"stop":729.148,"duration":14.98},{"text":"But after the federal lien arises, he's making a subsequent event after the Federal Government and we see no reason why that event should be maintained but the escrow arrangement will keep him fully current.","start":729.148,"stop":741.655,"duration":12.51},{"text":"And then since he has immediate notice of the default, he
