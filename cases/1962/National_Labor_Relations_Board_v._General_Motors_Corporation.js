the rights are guaranteed in Section 7, and where to take Section 8 (a) (3) prohibiting discrimination that encourages or discourages membership in any labor organization, and where to have stopped there, then of course, all forms of Union Security Clause: union shop, agency shop, closed shop, all the rest of them, would have been unlawful.","start":915.523,"stop":949.626,"duration":34.1},{"text":"Now, the office of the proviso was to say that in collective bargaining, you may go up to a certain

strict closed shop as it originally was.","start":967.734,"stop":996.073,"duration":28.34},{"text":"Now, this is not just a matter of speculation on my part, the legislative history of the Wagner Act

become the bargaining representative.","start":996.073,"stop":1020.456,"duration":24.38},{"text":"The Senate committee report stated that the bill does not interfere with the status quo on this debatable subject, but leaves the way open to such agreements as might now be legally consummated and of course they included even that early, a variety of forms of what we now call ‘Union Security

rejecting the interpretation below and for supporting the Board's interpretation is that the interpretation below would defeat while the Board's interpretation would advance that one of the basic statutory policies, that's the policy of encouraging the representatives of employees and the employers to work out the issues between them by collective bargaining and by negotiation in an effort to write those contracts which are most consonant with their individual needs and aspiration.","start":1050.144,"stop":1094.625,"duration":44.48},{"text":"The great virtue of collective bargaining is its flexibility, its adaptability, its creativity.","start":1094.625,"stop":1101.078,"duration":6.45},{"text":"I think one can say that for half a century there's been no more explosive issue than the union security question.","start":1101.078,"stop":1111.059,"duration":9.98},{"text":"What the interpretation below does is to outlaw most, if not all, the variance of the Union Security Clause that

it or leave it, without any room for this flexible, adaptable, creative process.","start":1111.059,"stop":1143.535,"duration":32.48},{"text":"And I emphasize that this would be the consequence not
