efforts to enforce its Milk Stabilization Act against independent contractors selling milk to commissary grocery stores, officers' clubs, post exchanges and to troop messes.","start":50.057,"stop":72.462,"duration":22.41},{"text":"Strictly the essentials, there are two basic issues here.","start":72.462,"stop":76.049,"duration":3.59},{"text":"The first is the Government’s request that this Court's decision in Penn Dairies versus Milk Control Commission in 318 of United States be overruled.","start":76.049,"stop":87.084,"duration":11.03},{"text":"That case held that the State of Pennsylvania could enforce its Milk Stabilization Act similar to California's against independent contractors selling to the United States and that it's statute as so applied was constitutional and was consistent with federal procurement policy.","start":87.084,"stop":107.481,"duration":20.4},{"text":"The second issue in this case among many but primary, is whether the Government acquired exclusive jurisdiction over three particular installations in California without complying with the state statutory condition that the Government inform us just which processors were being taken into federal jurisdiction.","start":107.481,"stop":131.185,"duration":23.7},{"text":"Following the entry of this injunction closing the state courts of the state, prices received by dairy farmers in California dropped sharply.","start":131.185,"stop":141.148,"duration":9.96},{"text":"They dropped to the extent that dairy farmers were suffering losses at the rate of nearly $7

milk.","start":165.134,"stop":182.246,"duration":17.11},{"text":"As construed by the California Supreme Court, the statute goes no further than the distributor and does not apply to the United

Terminal.","start":192.707,"stop":202.775,"duration":10.07},{"text":"The state statute was held unconstitutional on two grounds.","start":202.775,"stop":207.113,"duration":4.34},{"text":"First, that delivery of the milk occurred to these three bases and that these three bases were subject to the power in Congress to exercise the power of exclusive legislation under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution.","start":207.113,"stop":225.978,"duration":18.87},{"text":"In a second equally pervasive ground holding the state statute unconstitutional was that the state statute imposed a prohibition on the Government and its contracting officers in their purchase of milk.","start":225.978,"stop":245.428,"duration":19.45},{"text":"We believe that both of these constitutional issues were posed in the Government's complaints and adopted by the District Court for the Northern District of California.","start":245.428,"stop":257.077,"duration":11.65},{"text":"There being present, two constitutional issues in the case, it was proper then that a three-judge Federal District Court be convened, a three-judge court being properly convened then this Court has direct appellate jurisdiction.","start":257.077,"stop":273.706,"duration":16.63},{"text":"Both the Government and California agreed to this proposition.","start":273.706,"stop":279.083,"duration":5.38},{"text":"Following the Court's reservation of the question of jurisdiction to the time of oral argument, California filed also a petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Judicial Circuit before judgment in that court, if this Court cannot reach the merits of this case by appeal, then we ask and the Government joins us in asking that this Court hear the merits by certiorari.","start":279.083,"stop":305.594,"duration":26.51},{"text":"Turning to the merits, the purpose of the Milk Stabilization Act of California and of the 23 other states who have similar laws is to protect the state supply of a vital food by regulating the prices for milk.","start":305.594,"stop":324.751,"duration":19.16},{"text":"The state establishes minimum prices after public hearings and often after litigation.","start":324.751,"stop":334.105,"duration":9.35},{"text":"This public setting of prices is to be distinguished and indeed was intended to prevent collusive price setting by combinations of sellers.","start":334.105,"stop":346.742,"duration":12.64},{"text":"We think that this then emphasis or legislative objective of the California statute in and of itself shows that there's no conflict with the congressional objectives and the federal procurement statutes which are designed to prevent private collusive setting of prices by its emphasis on pre-competition.","start":346.742,"stop":369.206,"duration":22.46},{"text":"Minimum wholesale prices and the said fixing of it by the state was found necessary by the legislature because of internal and unique competitive problems in the industry which require that distributors be assured of a adequate return and a regular return money which would allow them to cover their own expenses and have enough left to pay the dairy farmers.","start":369.206,"stop":394.972,"duration":25.77},{"text":"And obviously, if the dairy farmers do not receive their cost production in the long run, our supply of a vital food will be impaired.","start":394.972,"stop":406.099,"duration":11.13},{"text":"The Government contends that the California law is unconstitutional because it imposes a direct prohibition on the Government.","start":406.099,"stop":416.59,"duration":10.49},{"text":"Our answer is that the District Court there erred because it should have given deference to the contrary opinion by the California Supreme Court that in the Penn -- Pacific Coast Dairy case in 319 Cal.2d, later reversed on another ground by this Court that the Milk Stab -- California Milk Stabilization Act does not apply as written, not as a matter of constitutional law but as written, it does not apply to the Government nor to its procurement officers.","start":416.59,"stop":444.872,"duration":28.28}]},{"speakerName":"William J.

United States.","start":551.107,"stop":556.785,"duration":5.68},{"text":"We understand that an even handed regulation of a contract with the United States which caused a burden which is passed on United States is constitutional.","start":556.785,"stop":568.556,"duration":11.77},{"text":"This Court passed on this identical issue in the Penn Dairies case in 318 of United States.","start":568.556,"stop":575.356,"duration":6.8},{"text":"Now, as specifically applied in our case, the United States purchases milk for a number of different uses.","start":575.356,"stop":584.758,"duration":9.4},{"text":"It purchases milk for resale through officers' clubs, post restaurants and post exchanges.","start":584.758,"stop":592.037,"duration":7.28},{"text":"These activities do not operate from federal moneys, but through private revolving funds.","start":592.037,"stop":597.508,"duration":5.47},{"text":"They are federal activities since they are operated under federal regulation but there is no loss or risk of loss of United States funds, and any increase in the burden is not passed to the Federal Treasury, but to patrons of officers' clubs and post restaurants and post exchanges.","start":597.508,"stop":616.883,"duration":19.38},{"text":"The Government in its brief makes no answer to our contention that this particular activity is constitutional, that is, that the application of our law to independent contractors selling to officers' clubs, post exchanges is constitutional and valid.","start":616.883,"stop":634.126,"duration":17.24},{"text":"Because these particular activities do not use federal funds, their purchases do not come under the Armed Services procurement statutes and therefore there could be no statutory conflict between the state and federal regulations.","start":634.126,"stop":648.002,"duration":13.88},{"text":"The second and major use for which the United States purchases milk is for resale through post commissaries.","start":648.002,"stop":657.111,"duration":9.11},{"text":"At the Oakland Army Terminal which is located in the harbor in the center of the City of Oakland, 78% of the milk purchased by the United States at that base is resold by it through its commissary.","start":657.111,"stop":669.621,"duration":12.51},{"text":"Here, the funds used are revolving funds, but are appropriated by the Congress in a continual and standing appropriation.","start":669.621,"stop":679.914,"duration":10.29},{"text":"The commissaries are operated without cost to the Government because under the army and the federal regulation, the price is charged, must be high enough to have the commissaries operate without cost to the Government.","start":679.914,"stop":693.633,"duration":13.72},{"text":"We think that the Congress in enacting the federal procurement statute specifically intended to accommodate state price fixing laws with respect to commissary sales because they expressly provided that the United States when purchasing for resale, need not go through the formal advertising procurement procedure, but may use non-competitive and negotiated procurement.","start":693.633,"stop":719.828,"duration":26.19},{"text":"By negotiation, this means that contracting officers, an individual supplier and just ordered the goods.","start":719.828,"stop":725.453,"duration":5.63},{"text":"He need not put it out for bids.","start":725.453,"stop":726.865,"duration":1.41},{"text":"He need not contact more than one supplier.","start":726.865,"stop":731.077,"duration":4.21},{"text":"And the reason, given in the congressional reports is that a commissary often as it has been buy by brand name to satisfy the needs of its patrons.","start":731.077,"stop":742.796,"duration":11.72},{"text":"Any increase in cost to the commissary then by the application of our state law to contractor selling to the commissary are not borne by the Federal Treasury but are then -- go back into the purchase price of the patron of the commissary.","start":742.796,"stop":763.14,"duration":20.34},{"text":"The Congress also has stated in the appropriation acts to the Department of Defense that commissary stores may not be established in areas served by adequate commercial facilities.","start":763.14,"stop":775.976,"duration":12.84},{"text":"Again, we think this shows that the commissary stores were not to operate in competition, door-to-door competition with a private retail store which must comply with state law.","start":775.976,"stop":788.462,"duration":12.49},{"text":"The Government maintains 242 major military installations in California.","start":788.462,"stop":795.066,"duration":6.6},{"text":"These installations through their commissary stores sell 20 million gallons of fresh milk.","start":795.066,"stop":801.834,"duration":6.77},{"text":"It is our experience that if this invidious discrimination between the prices of milk purchased by a retail grocery store and a commissary store continues that this will indeed destroy the California Milk Stabilization Act.","start":801.834,"stop":818.288,"duration":16.45},{"text":"Another category is that the United States to a lesser extent purchases milk for use in the troop kitchens, troop issue on the three bases involved here.","start":818.288,"stop":832.622,"duration":14.33},{"text":"The average was 30% of the total milk was used for troop issue.","start":832.622,"stop":837.633,"duration":5.01},{"text":"Here again, we think Congress' intuitive intent that the procurement statutes are to accommodate state price fixing laws.","start":837.633,"stop":846.298,"duration":8.66},{"text":"And then there is, the Court noted that again, procurement officers need not go through formal advertising procedures and procurement but may use non-competitive negotiated procurement because the -- this was a perishable commodity and further that the Government may use negotiated purchase where competition is impractical and one element of competition of course is eliminated when a floor is set on the price at which a contractor may sell milk to the United States.","start":846.298,"stop":882.556,"duration":36.26},{"text":"Further, the Congress through the Department of Agriculture subsidizes the purchase of milk for troop issue over and above the eight ounce basic ration at the rate of a little over 8 cents per quart.","start":882.556,"stop":898.65,"duration":16.09},{"text":"The reason that the Congress granted a subsidy was to ensure a national adequate quantity of milk.","start":898.65,"stop":907.259,"duration":8.61},{"text":"Now, this subsidy on purchases by the Armed Services goes through the contractor and then goes back to the dairy farmer.","start":907.259,"stop":916.079,"duration":8.82},{"text":"We think it's inconsistent for contracting officers utilizing their tremendous bargaining power to drive the prices down to the dairy
