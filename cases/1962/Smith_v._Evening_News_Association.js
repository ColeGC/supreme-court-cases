maintained.","start":413.339,"stop":423.611,"duration":10.27},{"text":"When the acts claimed to constitute the breach would also constitute an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act and within the jurisdiction of the Board.","start":423.611,"stop":435.938,"duration":12.33},{"text":"Now we contend that in a series of cases at the last term, this Court held that the pre-emption

union claimed that certain -- to go about changes including a wage increase had been agreed to.","start":504.11,"stop":510.685,"duration":6.57},{"text":"The company however repudiated the new agreement on the ground that its bargaining representatives had acted without authority.","start":510.685,"stop":519.373,"duration":8.69},{"text":"(Inaudible) the complaint as for a declaration that a new or modified contract was in effect and was legally binding and for a many judgment, apparently the first half of this period became moot to the passage of time while the litigation was going on.","start":519.373,"stop":537.73,"duration":18.36},{"text":"And the final decree entered in the Massachusetts courts awarded specific sums of money to named employees, the amounts being the difference of the higher wages provided by the new contract from those do under the old contract.","start":537.73,"stop":556.391,"duration":18.66},{"text":"Now, here the -- and then Massachusetts too, the company argued federal pre-emption on two grounds.","start":556.391,"stop":563.899,"duration":7.51},{"text":"They said first, that the suit couldn't be brought in state court because it should've been brought in federal court, the jurisdiction of the federal courts under Section 301 (a) is exclusive.","start":563.899,"stop":576.063,"duration":12.16},{"text":"It argued secondly that the conduct alleged also amounted to an unfair labor practice, that is, the company's repudiation of its bargaining representatives was a refusal to bargain.","start":576.063,"stop":590.108,"duration":14.04},{"text":"And it argued that at least in that situation federal jurisdiction but though the jurisdiction on the federal courts rather than of the Board should be exclusive.","start":590.108,"stop":604.006,"duration":13.9},{"text":"This Court rejected the claim of federal pre-emption.","start":604.006,"stop":608.073,"duration":4.07},{"text":"It pointed out that the Congress in enacting the Taft-Hartley Act had deliberately dropped proposals to make breach of contract and unfair labor practice.","start":608.073,"stop":624.214,"duration":16.14},{"text":"Both the Taft Bill in the Senate and the Hartley Bill in the House have contained such provisions.","start":624.214,"stop":632.104,"duration":7.89},{"text":"They were however dropped in conference.","start":632.104,"stop":634.971,"duration":2.87},{"text":"And this Court quoted from the report of the House Conferees as follows.","start":634.971,"stop":641.111,"duration":6.14},{"text":"Once parties have made a collective bargaining contract, the enforcement of that contract should be left the usual processes of the law and not the National Labor Relations Board.","start":641.111,"stop":654.342,"duration":13.23},{"text":"This Court declared that the considerations which had let it define pre-emption in such cases as Garner, Garmon, Anheuser-Busch were not applicable to suits for breach of collective bargaining agreements, because Congress had not elected to entrust cases growing out of such a breach exclusively to the NLRB but had left them to the courts.","start":654.342,"stop":680.177,"duration":25.84},{"text":"In answer to the claim that federal jurisdiction under 301 (a) was exclusive, the Court pointed out that the purpose of that provision was to provide an additional remedy not to contract an existing one.","start":680.177,"stop":695.913,"duration":15.74},{"text":"Finally, an answer to the contention that diversities and conflicts of doctrine would result from concurrent jurisdiction in this situation the Court stated that the federal common law of Labor Relations would control so that this Court could, if need be, resolve such conflicts and diversities.","start":695.913,"stop":718.285,"duration":22.37},{"text":"Now the Court in its opinion did not explicitly point out that the conduct alleged to as a breach of contract was also an unfair labor practice.","start":718.285,"stop":730.016,"duration":11.73},{"text":"It can hardly have escaped the Court's attention however.","start":730.016,"stop":733.64,"duration":3.62},{"text":"The opinion seems in part directed to that point and the case was argued at the same time as Lucas Flour which also involved that point.","start":733.64,"stop":744.843,"duration":11.2},{"text":"And then Lucas Flour which was decided shortly after Dowd Box, the Dowd Box opinion is cited on that point.","start":744.843,"stop":753.82,"duration":8.98},{"text":"Lucas Flour is the second of the cases at the last term which we think disposed of this issue.","start":753.82,"stop":761.035,"duration":7.21},{"text":"That is rather the reversed situation of Dowd Box.","start":761.035,"stop":764.872,"duration":3.84},{"text":"There the employers sued the union for damages for a strike claimed to be in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.","start":764.872,"stop":774.264,"duration":9.39},{"text":"The -- an agreement did not have a specific no-strike clause, it had a provision for final and binding arbitration of issues including issues as to discharge of an employee which was what had provoked the strike.","start":774.264,"stop":792.838,"duration":18.57},{"text":"The substantive issue which was before this Court was whether in that situation a strike was a violation of the contract.","start":792.838,"stop":803.747,"duration":10.91},{"text":"The union contended of course that it was not and that the strike was therefore protected concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act.","start":803.747,"stop":814.576,"duration":10.83},{"text":"It also argued that since its defense raised this issue within the competence of the NLRB that the pre-emption doctrine of Garmon should apply.","start":814.576,"stop":827.492,"duration":12.92},{"text":"This Court disposed of this contention in a footnote, Footnote 9 in 369 United States, at page 101.","start":827.492,"stop":837.763,"duration":10.27},{"text":"It said that since this was a suit for breach of contract that the doctrine of -- the pre-emption doctrine did not apply.","start":837.763,"stop":846.613,"duration":8.85},{"text":"It cited a number of Court of Appeals decisions which have held that a suit for breach of a collective bargaining agreement maybe maintained even though the acts constituting the breach are also an unfair labor practice.","start":846.613,"stop":862.243,"duration":15.63},{"text":"That is the general rule followed which has been followed in the Courts of Appeals.","start":862.243,"stop":868.308,"duration":6.06},{"text":"I think the way the state court authority probably is the other way.","start":868.308,"stop":872.869,"duration":4.56},{"text":"Anyway this Court cited those cases which hold that.","start":872.869,"stop":877.495,"duration":4.63},{"text":"It cited the Dowd Box case and finally before it said, “It is of course true that conduct which is a violation of a contractual obligation may also be conduct constituting an unfair labor practice.”","start":877.495,"stop":893.841,"duration":16.35},{"text":"And what has been said is not to imply that enforcement by a court of a contract obligation affects the jurisdiction of the NLRB to remedy unfair labor practices as such.","start":893.841,"stop":908.146,"duration":14.3},{"text":"The final case which seems to us dispositive of the issue is Atkinson v. Sinclair which in this respect was very like Lucas Flour.","start":908.146,"stop":922.051,"duration":13.91},{"text":"That is, it was a suit for a strike in alleged violation of a contract.","start":922.051,"stop":927.855,"duration":5.8},{"text":"It had the additional feature that one count of the suit was laid against individual employees and purported to be and federal jurisdiction now is invoked on grounds of diversity.","start":927.855,"stop":941.029,"duration":13.17},{"text":"The Court disposed of the pre-emption contention in our footnote simply saying again that it doesn't apply in suits for breach of collective agreements.","start":941.029,"stop":951.34,"duration":10.31}]},{"speakerName":"John M.

cases.","start":1011.128,"stop":1024.39,"duration":13.26},{"text":"We have argued that even if the issue be treated as an open one, the Court should reach the conclusion that the pre-emption doctrine of Garmon and Garner does not apply in contract actions.","start":1024.39,"stop":1041.903,"duration":17.51},{"text":"I will go over that very hurriedly since these points are not as I understand it, directly controverted by respondent.","start":1041.903,"stop":1051.618,"duration":9.71},{"text":"We say in essence that there is really no way that courts can avoid sometimes getting into issues which are within the competence of the NLRB.","start":1051.618,"stop":1064.738,"duration":13.12},{"text":"Lucas Flour for example is a case just of that sort.","start":1064.738,"stop":1070.321,"duration":5.58},{"text":"There, the claim that the strike was protected activity if that had precluded judicial jurisdiction, no remedy would have been available to the company.","start":1070.321,"stop":1081.929,"duration":11.61},{"text":"Again, the Board has found it necessary to decide precisely the issue which this Court decided in that case.","start":1081.929,"stop":1092.203,"duration":10.27},{"text":"For example, when a strike takes place, under board doctrine if the strike is in violation of a contract, the employer may discharge the employees.","start":1092.203,"stop":1104.211,"duration":12.01},{"text":"Therefore when that happens, it is necessary for the Board to decide whether the strike violates the contract.","start":1104.211,"stop":1111.198,"duration":6.99},{"text":"And in the Mead case, exactly on facts exactly like those in Lucas Flour, the Board did hold that a strike over an issue which the contract says maybe submitted to final combining arbitration violates the contract, so that the employer was within his rights in discharging the employees.","start":1111.198,"stop":1134.146,"duration":22.95},{"text":"That of course, is exactly the issue of interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act which this Court decided in Lucas Flour.","start":1134.146,"stop":1142.494,"duration":8.35},{"text":"And this Court cited the Mead case and other Board cases for its ruling.","start":1142.494,"stop":1150.596,"duration":8.1},{"text":"So that there really is no way as we see it that cases -- that issues can be taken in one category and the Courts can be kept out of them or that the Board on the other hand can be kept out of issues of contract interpretation.","start":1150.596,"stop":1168.067,"duration":17.47},{"text":"As a matter of fact, such sections as 8 (e), the so-called hot cargo clause of the contract of the Taft-Hartley Act as amended by Landrum-Griffin, make it an unfair labor practice for the parties to enter into a specified type of agreement.","start":1168.067,"stop":1187.927,"duration":19.86},{"text":"So the Board automatically is in the business of deciding whether the agreements have been entered into and of interpreting those agreements.","start":1187.927,"stop":1196.445,"duration":8.52},{"text":"It does the same thing under the union security provisions of course.","start":1196.445,"stop":1202.183,"duration":5.74},{"text":"But let me pass that and come to the respondent's contentions.","start":1202.183,"stop":1209.559,"duration":7.38},{"text":"Now, as I said below the respondent argued broadly as such cases as Garmon apply equally to suits for breach of a collective bargaining agreement.","start":1209.559,"stop":1224.887,"duration":15.33},{"text":"And that's what the Michigan courts held.","start":1224.887,"stop":1229.437,"duration":4.55},{"text":"That argument I take it is no longer open and I for -- and I take it in recognition of that, the respondent now undertakes to support the decision below on various narrower grounds.","start":1229.437,"stop":1244.812,"duration":15.38},{"text":"It undertakes to distinguish the decisions of the last term on two grounds.","start":1244.812,"stop":1251.574,"duration":6.76},{"text":"First, the respondent says that the contractual provision here directly parallels the content of Section 8 (a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act.","start":1251.574,"stop":1264.082,"duration":12.51},{"text":"So that its enforcement in the courts involves the possibility of a more direct conflict with NLRB doctrine then was involved in the cases at the last term.","start":1264.082,"stop":1278.376,"duration":14.29},{"text":"However, I don't see how you can get a possibility of anymore direct conflict and was present in the Lucas Flour case, the very issue which the Court decided there was one which have been decided by the Board and the Court relied on Board decisions as well as on Court decisions of -- for its interpretation of the contract.","start":1278.376,"stop":1303.307,"duration":24.93},{"text":"In other argument, the respondent makes is that here the remedy available before the NLRB would parallel that available in Court, that is back wages.","start":1303.307,"stop":1318.329,"duration":15.02},{"text":"And that this was not true of the cases at the last term.","start":1318.329,"stop":1322.38,"duration":4.05},{"text":"That is true but the second Garmon decision explicitly holds that it is not the comparability of remedies which determines a pre-emption or the lack of pre-emption but wholly different considerations.","start":1322.38,"stop":1343.218,"duration":20.84},{"text":"Also, the respondent undertakes to lay cases involving arbitration to one side.He undertakes to say that -- or to concede that arbitrators have concurrent jurisdiction or that courts have concurrent jurisdiction in enforcing agreements to arbitrate or in enforcing arbitration awards.","start":1343.218,"stop":1368.717,"duration":25.5},{"text":"The respondent seems to consider this required by the Warrior case, Lincoln Mills and so on.","start":1368.717,"stop":1375.556,"duration":6.84},{"text":"However, the possibility of conflict with NLRB doctrine is just as great in arbitration as it is in suits for
