the Perez case decided by this Court in 1824.","start":566.286,"stop":593.499,"duration":27.21},{"text":"Now, the Cornero case, of course, is the -- actually the strongest case that petitioner

liquor.","start":599.737,"stop":609.325,"duration":9.59},{"text":"He was indicted with three other co-defendants and they had all plead guilty at a previous -- previous hearing and they were out on their bond and their bond required them to return when the trial of the fourth defendant, Cornero, came up.","start":609.325,"stop":623.897,"duration":14.57},{"text":"And so the prosecutor announced ready on the assumption that these other defendants would not forfeit their bond and would appear since they‘d already plead guilty.","start":623.897,"stop":632.879,"duration":8.98},{"text":"On the day of the trial, the witnesses didn't show up.","start":632.879,"stop":636.814,"duration":3.93},{"text":"And so the prosecutor announced that he wasn't ready and in this case, Cornero asked for a continuance and they went out and tried to find the witnesses.","start":636.814,"stop":644.936,"duration":8.12},{"text":"Well they got continuances for five days and they still couldn't find them so the judge dismissed the jury.","start":644.936,"stop":650.491,"duration":5.55},{"text":"Two years later, they finally found them.","start":650.491,"stop":652.73,"duration":2.24},{"text":"So they brought Cornero back; they've picked another jury, he was convicted, and he appealed aptly a former jeopardy.","start":652.73,"stop":659.422,"duration":6.69},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit held he had been placed in jeopardy.","start":659.422,"stop":662.851,"duration":3.43},{"text":"And the language of the Ninth Circuit is particularly significant, and we would like to call it to the attention of the Court.","start":662.851,"stop":670.23,"duration":7.38},{"text":"It said the fact is that when the District Attorney empanelled the jury without first ascertaining whether or not his witnesses were present, he took a chance, this appears in page 7 of our brief.","start":670.23,"stop":682.507,"duration":12.28},{"text":"There is no difference in principle between the discovery by the District Attorney immediately after the jury was empanelled that his evidence was insufficient and the discovery after he'd call some or all of his witnesses.","start":682.507,"stop":696.411,"duration":13.9},{"text":"So we say that the Cornero case is similar that this was after the first jury was picked, no evidence was put on, the witnesses

jury.","start":704.898,"stop":709.001,"duration":4.1},{"text":"Now, the Government points out in this case, it's virtually on all force, the Government devotes only one paragraph to it on page 33 and 34 of their brief.","start":709.001,"stop":718.178,"duration":9.18},{"text":"And their only method of distinction it says, it says, “In a realistic sense, it could be said that the Government proceeded the trial without his evidence in Cornero, but in this case on the other hand, the Government was not preceding the trial without knowing that it had the witnesses to prove its case.”","start":718.178,"stop":733.064,"duration":14.89},{"text":"Well frankly, we do not see the distinction the Government makes.","start":733.064,"stop":736.343,"duration":3.28},{"text":"The only essential distinction is that there was two days rather than two years.","start":736.343,"stop":742.069,"duration":5.73},{"text":"And we say that this is not a meaningful distinction in the concept of jeopardy.","start":742.069,"stop":747.637,"duration":5.57},{"text":"The Gori case test is not the test of harassment which apparently the Government on page 39 would indicate that the test in jeopardy

indictment.","start":777.738,"stop":796.095,"duration":18.36},{"text":"Now, I think it's also significant to look at Justice Douglas' language in the dissent where he says that, “Once a jury has been

when the Court in this case discharged the jury, he was acting in an area in which this Court has time and again says it has wide and broad discretion.","start":1546.249,"stop":1558.445,"duration":12.2},{"text":"I don't believe that discretion should be disturbed in this case.","start":1558.445,"stop":1564.878,"duration":6.43},{"text":"Going to the first point which I mentioned, the fact that this jury was discharged before it had even assembled to hear the case, I'd

defendant.","start":1564.878,"stop":1584.173,"duration":19.3},{"text":"I might say parenthetically at this point that this question appears to have been before this Court on seven different occasions
