issues are presented to this Court whether the injunction is an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause whether as to the radio broadcasting station the injunction is

argument.","start":121.674,"stop":136.273,"duration":14.6},{"text":"The first is that the prohibition against carrying this advertising, there is no real or substantial relation to the end sought to be achieved by the State of New Mexico in adopting this law.","start":136.273,"stop":155.419,"duration":19.15},{"text":"And the other is that this prohibition against these advertising communications

Fourteenth.","start":155.419,"stop":174.175,"duration":18.76},{"text":"Now, in this connection, I want to point out to the Court that the appellee has raised the question as to the right of the appellants to present to the Court the latter issue, we dealt with this initially in our initial brief and we dealt with it more at length in our reply brief, I would like to just raise it now so the Court will not feel that I'm trying to smuggle in as Mr. Justice Jackson once referred to this practice not trying to smuggle in a new issue.","start":174.175,"stop":208.438,"duration":34.26},{"text":"I will develop how this issue gets before the Court at a later point.","start":208.438,"stop":213.794,"duration":5.36},{"text":"Now fourthly, we claim that the injunction deprives the appellant's equal protection of the laws in violation again of the Fourteenth

both New Mexico and Texas.","start":287.727,"stop":296.246,"duration":8.52},{"text":"I might mention here that Hobbs, New Mexico is in the southeastern part of New Mexico, five miles from the Texas

the laws of New Mexico relating to the practice of optometry in New Mexico.","start":327.766,"stop":337.483,"duration":9.72},{"text":"And the law which is under attack here is one of the laws that

disseminating the advertising of the Texas optometrist, the appellee in September 1960 filed in the District Court for Lea County, New Mexico, a complaint against these appellants and also against a Texas optometrist named Roberts and against another radio station named KWEW, charging them with a violation of the Optometry Acts of New Mexico and seeking to enjoin them specifically from accepting in New Mexico and publishing and broadcasting in New Mexico certain advertising of this optometrist, Roberts.","start":344.701,"stop":404.375,"duration":59.67},{"text":"Mr. Roberts is an optometrist

on this, the New Mexico Court, some two weeks before this case, came on -- or hearing before the New Mexico Court, entered a decree against Roberts enjoining him from advertising in any way, in any media in New Mexico.","start":436.274,"stop":456.382,"duration":20.11},{"text":"As I say, some two weeks later, there was a hearing in this case which the appellants appeared, having previously appeared by answer and having previously raised essentially the same constitutional questions which they have raised here.","start":456.382,"stop":475.778,"duration":19.4},{"text":"At this hearing, which was on the appellee's motion for summary judgment, what few facts are in the record were elicited, and based on these, the district judge enjoin the appellants from disseminating -- accepting

evidence.","start":506.235,"stop":512.089,"duration":5.85},{"text":"As Your Honors will see, the record is fairly thin in this case but I think the evidence does show quite clearly that the appellants are business people in New Mexico, that they had accepted advertising from an optometrist in Texas and that they are now restrained from doing so under the sanction of the New Mexico courts.","start":512.089,"stop":542.905,"duration":30.82},{"text":"They now have the choice either of abiding by that and not disseminating the advertising or disseminating the advertising and facing

States.","start":584.09,"stop":601.272,"duration":17.18},{"text":"I think we will have difficulty with that but it isn't the case before the Court, so I would prefer not to -- not to take a definitive

point.","start":617.658,"stop":625.013,"duration":7.36},{"text":"It's a case that the appellee has made a great deal of and that the American Associate -- Optometric Association which has filed a brief as amicus curiae has also made a great deal of.","start":625.013,"stop":639.573,"duration":14.56},{"text":"In fact, that case has no bearing at all on the issues involved in this case.","start":639.573,"stop":646.565,"duration":6.99},{"text":"That was a case involving an Oklahoma statute which had a specific proviso excluding from its coverage any advertising media which might publish or disseminate advertising of persons such as optometrist or opticians or ophthalmologist who were covered by the Act.","start":646.565,"stop":671.437,"duration":24.87},{"text":"Secondly, the parties to the action were opticians and ophthalmologists and no advertising media was in any way involved.","start":671.437,"stop":682.89,"duration":11.45},{"text":"And in fact, all this Court held was that the Act is applied to these opticians and ophthalmologists did not violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.","start":682.89,"stop":697.921,"duration":15.03},{"text":"There was perhaps an interstate commerce question raised in that case which was the question I adverted to earlier.","start":697.921,"stop":707.521,"duration":9.6},{"text":"The parties in the case tried to urge apparently that because they advertise their services endorsed papers in interstate commerce, they ought to be immune from this regulation because it burdened interstate commerce.","start":707.521,"stop":726.586,"duration":19.07},{"text":"The Court did not deal with this question at all in its opinion nor did the lower court, the District Court in Oklahoma deal with this question.","start":726.586,"stop":737.034,"duration":10.45},{"text":"So we submit that the Williamson case in no way controls this case.","start":737.034,"stop":747.257,"duration":10.22},{"text":"The theory of the district judge in granting the injunction against these appellants was that they were engaged in the conspiracy to aid and abet Roberts, the Texas optometrist to violate the laws of the State of New Mexico.","start":747.257,"stop":769.45,"duration":22.19},{"text":"And that even though Roberts was a nonresident and the Court had no jurisdiction over him, I might mention here that the District Court specifically said Roberts is a nonresident and we have no jurisdiction over him.","start":769.45,"stop":785.168,"duration":15.72},{"text":"The Court thought that nevertheless because it conceived this to be a conspiracy, this appellant should be enjoined from disseminating this advertising, and accordingly on April 7, 1961, he entered such an injunction.","start":785.168,"stop":805.693,"duration":20.52},{"text":"Now, thereafter, the appellants including the other radio station which is not a party to this appeal, appealed to the New Mexico Supreme Court.","start":805.693,"stop":816.07,"duration":10.38},{"text":"They raised essentially the same issues raised here as well as some other issues which are not now raised.","start":816.07,"stop":824.509,"duration":8.44},{"text":"New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed the District Court on April 11, 1962 and the appellants who were before this Court took an appeal on July 6.","start":824.509,"stop":839.355,"duration":14.85},{"text":"This Court noted probable jurisdiction on November 13, 1962.","start":839.355,"stop":844.395,"duration":5.04},{"text":"And at that time, while the issue had been raised in the body of the jurisdictional statement but had not been separately stated, the Court asked that the parties address themselves to the preemption problem, preemption by the Federal Communications Act and invited the Solicitor General to state the views of the FCC.","start":844.395,"stop":881.726,"duration":37.33},{"text":"I think it's clear, if the Court please, that the purpose of the Commerce Clause was to avoid rivalries among the States, to avoid the
