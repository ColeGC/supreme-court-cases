evidentiary consequences of the unlawful arrest of petitioner, Toy.","start":19.294,"stop":36.402,"duration":17.11},{"text":"Specifically, we were discussing the admissibility of the oral statement which he made immediately after his arrest in his home.","start":36.402,"stop":50.392,"duration":13.99},{"text":"That statement, you will recall, was a denial of the fact that he had sold narcotics to one Hom Way, and a further statement to the narcotics officers that he knew were there was some heroin namely in the home of one Johnny, whom we later learned to be a Johnny Yee.","start":50.392,"stop":79.457,"duration":29.06},{"text":"It is our contention if the Court please, that since the arrest of petitioner Toy was unlawful, his detention was unlawful ab initio.","start":79.457,"stop":93.614,"duration":14.16},{"text":"And since his detention was unlawful ab initio, the statement which was offered against him at his trial was a statement made during his unlawful detention.","start":93.614,"stop":105.799,"duration":12.19},{"text":"This Court, in a line of cases since 1943, has held that statements made by an accused during a period of unlawful detention are inadmissible against him by reason of the fact that they were obtained in violation of a statutory right.","start":105.799,"stop":126.452,"duration":20.65},{"text":"It is our contention if the Court please, that a fortiori statements made during a period of illegal detention brought about by a violation of his constitutional rights should be rendered inadmissible by this Court.","start":126.452,"stop":144.468,"duration":18.02},{"text":"Now, just as physical, tangible and visible evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment had been held to be inadmissible by the Court so too unequivocally, this Court held last year in the case of Silverman against the United States that verbal, oral evidence is likewise protected within the Fourth Amendment.","start":144.468,"stop":170.351,"duration":25.88},{"text":"And if this evidence has seized in violation of the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, it is likewise excludable.","start":170.351,"stop":179.182,"duration":8.83},{"text":"Now, our research, if the Court please, has found only two cases in all of federal jury's prudence that are apposite to the case at bar, none from this Court.","start":179.182,"stop":197.834,"duration":18.65},{"text":"In 1940, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had before in a case on all

appellant.","start":233.313,"stop":239.129,"duration":5.82},{"text":"They made an unlawful entry into his home.","start":239.129,"stop":242.413,"duration":3.28},{"text":"They went to the second floor, they found him.","start":242.413,"stop":245.669,"duration":3.26},{"text":"And he immediately admitted that he had been driving the car which was involved in the accident.","start":245.669,"stop":255.124,"duration":9.45},{"text":"The question before the Appeals' Court was whether that statement, that oral statement made as the result of an unlawful entry might be admitted against him in his trial for drunk and driving.","start":255.124,"stop":267.32,"duration":12.2},{"text":"And the Court of Appeals unanimously held that the protection of the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule, which came into being in 1914 in the Weeks case, rendered that oral statement inadmissible against him and struck down the evidence as having been obtained through the violation of the Fourth Amendment.","start":267.32,"stop":290.31,"duration":22.99},{"text":"Again, in a case exactly in point with the case at

Williams, as you explain it to us, it strikes me that that case involved these overtones of the Fifth Amendment as well as the Fourth Amendment which makes it, in some ways unlike the case now before

operation.","start":388.902,"stop":395.171,"duration":6.27},{"text":"His wife said to the officers who arrested her that her husband would be home in 20 minutes.","start":395.171,"stop":404.692,"duration":9.52},{"text":"And so they went downstairs and stood in front of the building and awaited the return of appellant Somer.","start":404.692,"stop":413.002,"duration":8.31},{"text":"Somer came along in his car 20 minutes later, and there was whiskey in the

suppress the evidence found in the apartment on the ground that it was gained as a result of an unlawful entry and unlawful arrest.","start":424.488,"stop":433.451,"duration":8.96},{"text":"But the trial court refused to suppress the evidence found outside in the automobile of -- of appellant Somer.","start":433.451,"stop":441.562,"duration":8.11},{"text":"When the case went to the Second Circuit, Judge Hand writing for unanimous court found that if the police had gone down to the front of the house and waited for Somer because of the information which they received from Mrs. Somer resulting from their unlawful entry that it could not be admitted against the appellant Somer.","start":441.562,"stop":462.879,"duration":21.32},{"text":"And it sent the case back to the lower court

Sun.","start":3105.319,"stop":3115.169,"duration":9.85},{"text":"I think the agents were also entitled to take into the account although it was fairly remote that Hom Way's original story had put them
