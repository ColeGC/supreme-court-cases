last three words on page 2, on the state capital ground, on adjacent sidewalks and streets, did commit a breach of the peace and that they, together with a large group of people, had assembled and impede the normal traffic, singing and parading with placards, failed to disperse upon lawful orders of police officer, all of which tended directly to immediate violence and breach of the peace in

word violation appears instead of violence.","start":193.897,"stop":209.469,"duration":15.57},{"text":"Again, I stress that the rule of law under which petitioners were convicted, contemplates violence and the warrants with which they were charged contemplate violence.","start":209.469,"stop":220.253,"duration":10.78},{"text":"Now, the Circuit Court opinion, that is the intermediate appellate court opinion, also suggests that there was violence, but not so strongly.","start":220.253,"stop":233.611,"duration":13.36},{"text":"On pages 193 and 194, there is a discussion of the reason why the conviction should be upheld, and at page 194 is the -- what I would call suggestion of violence at the end of the first full paragraph.","start":233.611,"stop":250.719,"duration":17.11},{"text":"While it is a constitutional right to assemble in a hall to espouse any cause, no person has the right to organize demonstrations

Greenberg","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, it will be there tomorrow.","start":428.537,"stop":432.572,"duration":4.04},{"text":"Now, our argument in this case is that first of all, that on this record, there is absolutely no evidence of violence or insipient violence by petitioners or by anyone else that is neither petitioners nor the so-called onlookers who presumably were in opposition group were violent and threaten violence, no indication of violence could've occurred.","start":432.572,"stop":453.074,"duration":20.5},{"text":"Consequently, under the decisions of this Court, the most pertinent one would be Taylor versus Louisiana, Garner versus Louisiana, and Thompson versus the City of Louisville.","start":453.074,"stop":464.142,"duration":11.07},{"text":"These convictions must fall as being based upon no evidence of either the charge made or in this case, the rule of law under which the charge was made.","start":464.142,"stop":473.568,"duration":9.43},{"text":"Secondly, that it -- in the facts of this case, somehow rather, there can be seen a situation involving actual or imminent or threatened violence and it would be violence in the part of onlookers, not in the part of these petitioners who admittedly were quite peaceful towards everything they did, and we deny this can be found in the conduct of the onlookers, but if it were to be found in there, it was the duty of the police to proceed against the aggressors or the would-be aggressors and not to gratify these aggressors by proceeding against those who were committing no violation of the law.","start":473.568,"stop":508.374,"duration":34.81},{"text":"And in fact, there is a South Carolina statute which we do not have quoted in our brief, which is Section 16-559 which makes it a crime to assault someone for expressing a political opinion.","start":508.374,"stop":523.503,"duration":15.13},{"text":"And so, this further sharpens the notion that it was the duty of the police to proceed against those who would assault the petitioners who were expressing what obviously was a political opinion, and that moreover decisions of this Court, Taylor versus Louisiana, Aaron v. Cooper, Little Rock School case, Buchanan v. Warley, all stand for the proposition that it is the aggressors who must be put down and not those who were engaged constitutionally protected freedom.","start":523.503,"stop":554.09,"duration":30.59},{"text":"Moreover, we have reference in our argument that we will have to the case of Feiner versus New York upon which the court below rested its opinion and upon which the respondent rests.","start":554.09,"stop":564.042,"duration":9.95},{"text":"It's our position that the Feiner case is quite clearly distinguishable on its facts.","start":564.042,"stop":568.825,"duration":4.78},{"text":"The facts in the Feiner case and the issues in the Feiner case were not the facts and issues here.","start":568.825,"stop":574.551,"duration":5.73},{"text":"However, it would be our position that to any extent, Feiner were pertinent here, we would submit that it was the dissenters in Feiner who were correct and who have been vindicated by subsequent law especially in this area and that the majority opinion no longer is the law.","start":574.551,"stop":593.177,"duration":18.63},{"text":"And finally, it is our contention that if these petitioners could be punished at all, they should not have been punished under a vague, general, common law concept of breach of the peace, and by this, we have -- we advert to the opinion of this Court in Cantwell versus Connecticut, and Mr. Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in the Garner case, but that they should have been punished if at all, they could have been punished under a narrowly drawn precise statute directed to this kind of conduct.","start":593.177,"stop":622.271,"duration":29.09},{"text":"And that in fact, in South Carolina at this time, there were a number of statutes, a disorderly conduct statute, a statute regulating traffic around the State House grounds, an ordinance in Columbia limiting the size of groups that might parade and the ordinance in Columbia directed to blocking the sidewalk.","start":622.271,"stop":641.526,"duration":19.25},{"text":"And that all these statutes and ordinance that might have applied to the situation, but instead not proceeding on any of them which express state policy with regard to this type of conduct.","start":641.526,"stop":653.003,"duration":11.48},{"text":"The State in fact proceeded under its very general notion of breach of the peace.","start":653.003,"stop":657.808,"duration":4.8},{"text":"Now the facts of the case were the 190 Negro college and high school students gathered in a church in Columbia early in March 1960 with the purpose of protesting racial segregation in the State of South Carolina.","start":657.808,"stop":675.166,"duration":17.36},{"text":"They proceeded to march from the church to the State House in small groups of about 15 to 18, each group being separated from the other by one-third to one-half of a block.","start":675.166,"stop":687.667,"duration":12.5},{"text":"Now the record, I think is complicated but becomes immediately simple if you look at this picture.","start":687.667,"stop":695.865,"duration":8.2},{"text":"They came from this direction down Gervais Street and when they reached -- assembled here, some of them entered the State House ground at this point.","start":695.865,"stop":705.077,"duration":9.21},{"text":"And some of them continued down Gervais Street and entered the State House grounds at this point, which is also known as the “horseshoe.”","start":705.077,"stop":713.44,"duration":8.36},{"text":"Now the reason for numbers was that the numbers were a function of the expression in which they were trying to engage.","start":713.44,"stop":722.853,"duration":9.41},{"text":"Their point was and this appears quite clearly in the record, that it is often said that Negroes like segregation in the South, that they're not dissatisfied with it, and that they don't want to do anything about it.","start":722.853,"stop":733.899,"duration":11.05},{"text":"And they may very deliberately got together a large number of people to go and make this protest so as to make the point that there was general dissatisfaction with these conditions.","start":733.899,"stop":743.374,"duration":9.48},{"text":"And on page 112 of the record, one of the demonstrators testified, “We were there to protest in order that they might see for themselves that the -- we were in number and that we did not and we still do not go along with the principles of segregation.”","start":743.374,"stop":760.883,"duration":17.51},{"text":"And so, this was not a type of protest that could have been made reasonably in any other way other than the way in which it was made.","start":760.883,"stop":769.726,"duration":8.84},{"text":"They carried with them signs and placards such as down with segregation and things of that nature.","start":769.726,"stop":780.053,"duration":10.33},{"text":"They entered the State House grounds, at the two points that I indicated, and on the scene were a number of police officers, the number of which is not clear from the record, the police officers themselves estimate anywhere from 15 to 40 city police officers, a number of the most commonly given number is about 30 however, a number of representatives of the state law enforcement division and two deputy sheriffs.","start":780.053,"stop":807.123,"duration":27.07},{"text":"They were quiet and they were orderly and the record is quite clear in a good many places though you might most particularly refer to page 88 when the chief was asked, “Did any of your men make a report that any of these persons were disorderly in walking around the State House grounds?”","start":807.123,"stop":825.392,"duration":18.27},{"text":"They did not.","start":825.392,"stop":826.39,"duration":1},{"text":"Under normal circumstances, your men would report to you when you're at the scene.","start":826.39,"stop":830.259,"duration":3.87},{"text":"They should.","start":830.259,"stop":831.653,"duration":1.39},{"text":"Is it reasonable to assume then that there was no disorderly conduct on the part of these persons since you receive no report from your officer?","start":831.653,"stop":839.163,"duration":7.51},{"text":"I would take that for granted, yes.","start":839.163,"stop":841.504,"duration":2.34},{"text":"Now there is some testimony that they were singing and otherwise vocal when they first entered the grounds.","start":841.504,"stop":850.056,"duration":8.55},{"text":"However, this was given by State officers who upon cross-examination in each instance retracted this testimony and it's quite clear that none of the singing occurred until after they were given an order to leave.","start":850.056,"stop":863.138,"duration":13.08},{"text":"After they entered the State House grounds, they proceeded to walk around the State House quietly bearing signs all the while, in fact, all during the time in question in these small groups.","start":863.138,"stop":876.412,"duration":13.27},{"text":"While they were doing this, traffic to some extent slowed down to see what was going on and a police officer was dispatched to the scene to move the traffic along more expeditiously.","start":876.412,"stop":887.316,"duration":10.9},{"text":"At the same time, people coming in and out of the State House during the lunch hour were to some extent interfered with, however, the sidewalk was at all times wide enough to accommodate more than two persons walking abreast, the petitioners were never more than two abreast and there was no real difficulty of anyone from the part of anyone in getting involved.","start":887.316,"stop":907.619,"duration":20.3},{"text":"And pedestrians were freely able to go in and out of the
