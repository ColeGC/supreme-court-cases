taxable as ordinary income rather than capital gain.","start":504.569,"stop":518.698,"duration":14.13},{"text":"A collapsible corporation is a very special kind of entity defined in paragraph two of the statute.","start":518.698,"stop":528.041,"duration":9.34},{"text":"It is a corporation formed or availed off principally for the construction of property with a view to achieving two particular objectives.","start":528.041,"stop":538.295,"duration":10.25},{"text":"The first result that must be intended is the shareholders sale or exchange of stock in the corporation before the corporation

statute?","start":587.705,"stop":599.615,"duration":11.91},{"text":"It is our position that the profit realized here was not the gain contemplated by the statute.","start":599.615,"stop":606.674,"duration":7.06},{"text":"We contend that gain attributable to the property within the meaning of the statute is gain which would be ordinary income from the property if the stockholders as individuals or the corporations had realized it in a normal course of business.","start":606.674,"stop":625.15,"duration":18.48},{"text":"Here the profit would have clearly been a capital gain, not ordinary income, if the taxpayers had directly owned and sold the development or if the corporation itself had sold it.","start":625.15,"stop":638.167,"duration":13.02},{"text":"There was no conversion of ordinary income here to incorporation and a sale of stock.","start":638.167,"stop":646.202,"duration":8.03},{"text":"Now the Court of Appeals fully agreed with us in that there was no such avoidance here.","start":646.202,"stop":652.662,"duration":6.46},{"text":"However, it then went on to hold that the critical language, “gain attributable to such property” means any kind of profit regardless of

illuminated and spelled out by the legislative history.","start":667.005,"stop":677.501,"duration":10.5},{"text":"In fact, the Court of Appeals frankly indicated that its conclusion is not in accord with the stated purpose and policy of Congress.","start":677.501,"stop":687.532,"duration":10.03},{"text":"As the legislative history plainly shows, this statute is solely concerned with profit which

that.","start":706.941,"stop":718.791,"duration":11.85},{"text":"I have indicated that the statute is solely concerned with gain which is a conversion of ordinary income.","start":718.791,"stop":726.398,"duration":7.61},{"text":"That is why the definition of a collapsible corporation is specifically geared to whether or not the corporation itself has realized a substantial part of the net income from the property before the sale of the stock, and that is why the definition is also geared to the specific purpose or motive which prompted the stockholders to construct the property.","start":726.398,"stop":752.216,"duration":25.82},{"text":"As the expensive legislative history shows, before 1950, various taxpayers in the movie industry and the construction industry were converting ordinary income into capital gain through the calculated abuse of the corporate forum.","start":752.216,"stop":768.577,"duration":16.36},{"text":"For example, if motion picture producer made a movie as an individual and rented the picture under the usual arrangement, his rental income was taxable as ordinary income.","start":768.577,"stop":779.766,"duration":11.19},{"text":"If he did the same through a corporation, the rental income was also taxable as ordinary income.","start":779.766,"stop":785.998,"duration":6.23},{"text":"In order to avoid such unpleasant results, a producer would setup a corporation to make a film.","start":785.998,"stop":792.846,"duration":6.85},{"text":"Upon completing the film, he would liquidate the corporation and distribute the film to himself.","start":792.846,"stop":800.055,"duration":7.21},{"text":"He would report the difference between the cost of his stock and the value of the film as a long-term capital gain.","start":800.055,"stop":808.226,"duration":8.17},{"text":"He would then license the film as the corporation would have done and amortize the reported value of the film against the rental income.","start":808.226,"stop":818.16,"duration":9.93},{"text":"In this way, the usual ordinary income from the property, that is the rental income, was converted into capital gain.","start":818.16,"stop":825.932,"duration":7.77},{"text":"The same kind of practice developed in the construction industry where houses were built for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.","start":825.932,"stop":836.605,"duration":10.67},{"text":"If a builder constructed and sold the houses himself, the profit on the sale was ordinary income.","start":836.605,"stop":843.68,"duration":7.07},{"text":"If he made the sale through a corporation, the profit was also ordinary income.","start":843.68,"stop":849.652,"duration":5.97},{"text":"Builders would convert this ordinary income into capital gain in one of two ways; they would sell the stock in the corporation or they would liquidate the corporation, report a capital gain based on the difference between the cost of their stock and the value of the houses and then sell the houses at the same price.","start":849.652,"stop":871.329,"duration":21.68},{"text":"In either case, the content of the gain was profit normally realized as ordinary income.","start":871.329,"stop":878.668,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Congress enacted Section 117(m) to tax all such converted income from the constructed property in terms of its true economic content as ordinary income.","start":878.668,"stop":892.632,"duration":13.96},{"text":"The gain attributable to the property with which the statute is concerned is such converted ordinary income.","start":892.632,"stop":900.138,"duration":7.51},{"text":"That is why the statute treats the corporation as a mere contrivance to avoid tax, and that is why it treats the stockholder's profit as the ordinary income it essentially is.","start":900.138,"stop":913.353,"duration":13.21},{"text":"The tax payer in this way is prevented from avoiding the tax that he should otherwise pay and rightfully pay.","start":913.353,"stop":922.616,"duration":9.26},{"text":"Here as I have said, we do not have any such situation.","start":922.616,"stop":926.216,"duration":3.6},{"text":"The profit was not a contrived substitute for ordinary income from the property.","start":926.216,"stop":931.616,"duration":5.4},{"text":"The government has not been deprived of any revenue to which it would otherwise be entitled.","start":931.616,"stop":938.056,"duration":6.44},{"text":"In short, it is our position that a statute which is directed against avoidance should be carefully confined to those against whom it was directed.","start":938.056,"stop":948.466,"duration":10.41},{"text":"It should not be applied indiscriminately as if it were a massacre.","start":948.466,"stop":953.547,"duration":5.08},{"text":"Indeed as we pointed out in our brief, here the treasury is even better off than it would otherwise have been if the taxpayers had built and owned the property as individuals, because if they had done that then the assets would have been sold directly to the purchaser and the purchaser would have used as his basis for depreciation, his higher cost, which was not available to the purchaser here, because a corporation continued to own the development.","start":953.547,"stop":983.671,"duration":30.12},{"text":"I should add that the Commissioner fully agrees with our understanding of Congress' purpose and then he pays no attention to what he says.","start":983.671,"stop":993.532,"duration":9.86},{"text":"He fully agrees that the admitted and “basic purpose of the statute is to prevent the conversion of ordinary income into capital gain,” and he emphasizes, “that statutory language should be read, indeed even strained to some degree to avoid absurd results to carry out the discovered purposes of Congress and in general in an effort to produce a rational, sensible structure.”","start":993.532,"stop":1023.705,"duration":30.17},{"text":"But having said all this, he nevertheless argues, as the Court of Appeals held that the statute applies regardless of whether the taxpayers realize the gain contemplated by Congress or regardless to put in another way of whether the result is absurd.","start":1023.705,"stop":1043.877,"duration":20.17},{"text":"However, even the Commissioner is unhappy with the Court of Appeals opinion.","start":1043.877,"stop":1049.612,"duration":5.74},{"text":"And so, he has tried to remedy the situation by arguing that any gain realized on a sale of constructed property as distinguished from purchased property is ordinary income.","start":1049.612,"stop":1065.073,"duration":15.46},{"text":"We cannot say frankly, we have studied the Commissioners brief, we cannot say how the Commissioner came to this conclusion.","start":1065.073,"stop":1073.904,"duration":8.83},{"text":"It seems to be a well kept secret.","start":1073.904,"stop":1077.081,"duration":3.18},{"text":"However, even the Commissioner finally realizes that this strange argument will not do.","start":1077.081,"stop":1085.21,"duration":8.13},{"text":"Therefore in the end, all he can say is that the statute taxes a gain as ordinary income whether or not it is a contrived conversion of ordinary income.","start":1085.21,"stop":1099.872,"duration":14.66},{"text":"We say that what the government has done is to make a travesty of the

gain.","start":1104.888,"stop":1131.718,"duration":26.83},{"text":"That argument is made; whether it's good or not --","start":1131.718,"stop":1133.922,"duration":2.2}]},{"speakerName":"Louis

this; he argues that the proceeds realized on a sale of the stock represent a conversion of ordinary income attributable to their services to the corporations.","start":1145.492,"stop":1159.028,"duration":13.54},{"text":"As he puts it, by waiving the compensation for their services, the taxpayers were able to realize an amount over and above

what he considers is essential.","start":1174.104,"stop":1191.249,"duration":17.14},{"text":"Now in making this new argument, the Commissioner overlooks a good many things, which are in the record, as

constructed property not with the adequacy of compensation that may or may not have been paid to stockholders while the hearings indicate, that is the congressional hearings indicate that at times

byproduct.","start":1201.67,"stop":1231.846,"duration":30.18},{"text":"In other words, they were being wrung in on what is otherwise a collapsible

enacted.","start":1257.01,"stop":1278.782,"duration":21.77},{"text":"The next point I would like to make is this; in any event the Corporations did not enable the taxpayers to avoid taxes that would

efforts.","start":1299.875,"stop":1306.353,"duration":6.48},{"text":"Congress has made only one exception to that rule and as a matter of fact that was the rule that came in when the collapsible
