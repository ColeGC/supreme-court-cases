concluded that the Board had jurisdiction.","start":51.349,"stop":57.187,"duration":5.84},{"text":"The Board adopted the findings of the examiner in this respect and held that it had jurisdiction.","start":57.187,"stop":63.725,"duration":6.54},{"text":"On petition for enforcement by the Board before the Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit, the findings on the merits were approved, but the court had some doubt about the jurisdiction of the Board over the dispute in question, but the court didn’t resolve that issue.","start":63.725,"stop":83.306,"duration":19.58},{"text":"It simply felt that the findings were insufficient and therefore remanded the case to the Board in its words to make further findings --

granted.","start":109.78,"stop":119.805,"duration":10.03},{"text":"The relevant jurisdictional facts are these.","start":119.805,"stop":123.322,"duration":3.52},{"text":"Reliance is a fuel oil dealer on Long Island in New York State.","start":123.322,"stop":130.458,"duration":7.14},{"text":"It sells fuel oil for heating purposes to homeowners, all of whom live on Long Island.","start":130.458,"stop":138.326,"duration":7.87},{"text":"It also services their burners, their oil burners.","start":138.326,"stop":143.532,"duration":5.21},{"text":"It's gross sales in 1959, 1959 is the pertinent period because labor dispute charged here occurred in January and February 1960 and these were the most recent figures, in 1959, this company, Reliance, sold something over six-and-three quarter million gallons of fuel oil of a value exceeding half a million dollars.","start":143.532,"stop":169.668,"duration":26.14},{"text":"Besides certain office personnel, supervisors

those that were involved in the labor dispute.","start":184.771,"stop":191.197,"duration":6.43},{"text":"I won't detail the labor dispute the way in which it was resolved because that issue is now before the court.","start":191.197,"stop":198.329,"duration":7.13},{"text":"The -- as I say, the court affirmed the Board's finding that Reliance had been guilty of unfair labor practices towards these 21 employees and in an inappropriate order which was affirmed or which the court indicated it would affirm if it had not had doubts about jurisdiction.","start":198.329,"stop":217.688,"duration":19.36},{"text":"Getting back to the jurisdictional facts, Reliance buys this oil which it sells to homeowners on Long Island.","start":217.688,"stop":225.783,"duration":8.09},{"text":"It buys most, if not all of this oil, from the Gulf Oil Corporation.","start":225.783,"stop":231.851,"duration":6.07},{"text":"These purchases during the pertinent period, exceed $650,000 for the year.","start":231.851,"stop":240.207,"duration":8.36},{"text":"Gulf Oil Corporation of course is a large company, concededly involved in interstate commerce, with more than $3 billion in annual gross revenues.","start":240.207,"stop":251.197,"duration":10.99},{"text":"Now the greater part of this fuel oil which is sold by Reliance on Long Island, and which it purchases from Gulf is refined by Gulf out of the State of New York.","start":251.197,"stop":264.323,"duration":13.13},{"text":"Gulf brings it in from outside the state into its tanks in New York City.","start":264.323,"stop":271.977,"duration":7.65},{"text":"From there, it ships a certain portion to its tanks, Gulf's tanks, at Long Island from where the company involved, Reliance picks it up and delivers it to its customers.","start":271.977,"stop":284.525,"duration":12.55},{"text":"Summarizing the jurisdictional fact then, Reliance locally sells a product which has been manufactured out of state, but which has twice temporarily come to rest within the states.","start":284.525,"stop":298.589,"duration":14.06},{"text":"The volume of these purchases is well over a quarter of a million dollars, probably more than half a million dollars.","start":298.589,"stop":307.315,"duration":8.73},{"text":"Another fact that should be emphasized perhaps is that purchases by Reliance are not made through an intermediary.","start":307.315,"stop":314.603,"duration":7.29},{"text":"They're made directly from the manufacturer, the company involved in the interstate commerce.","start":314.603,"stop":321.466,"duration":6.86},{"text":"Now on basis of these facts, the Board held that it had jurisdiction.","start":321.466,"stop":325.76,"duration":4.29},{"text":"That said it didn't simply assume jurisdiction.","start":325.76,"stop":328.462,"duration":2.7},{"text":"It discussed the question, it added specific findings, it concluded the jurisdiction existed.","start":328.462,"stop":335.295,"duration":6.83},{"text":"The findings of the Board which takes three pages in the record, pages 10 through 12, will bear out that session.","start":335.295,"stop":345.097,"duration":9.8},{"text":"At the beginning, I like to stress that the Board did not rest jurisdiction solely on a finding that its monetary standards were satisfied.","start":345.097,"stop":356.794,"duration":11.7},{"text":"There's an implication in the Court of Appeal opinion and in the respondent's brief that what the Board did in effect per se, this is a retail concern, our discretionary standard with respect to retail concerns is the gross volume of business standard of half a million dollars.","start":356.794,"stop":376.703,"duration":19.91},{"text":"Reliance meets this test, therefore, we have jurisdiction.","start":376.703,"stop":381.091,"duration":4.39},{"text":"The Board did not do that.","start":381.091,"stop":382.498,"duration":1.41},{"text":"It found that there was indeed more than half a million dollars worth of gross volume of business, but it also separately, independently found that the activities of Reliance were so related to interstate commerce that a shut down of this plant would affect interstate commerce in the statutory and constitutional sense.","start":382.498,"stop":409.65,"duration":27.15},{"text":"We don't ask this Court to hold that every time there is a company which has indirectly imports of more than X dollars and those X dollars meet the discretionary standards which the Board has setup, therefore, the Board should exercise jurisdiction.","start":409.65,"stop":428.917,"duration":19.27},{"text":"We recognize that the Commerce Clause is not to be measured in terms of rigid dollars spent.","start":428.917,"stop":439.82,"duration":10.9},{"text":"This also addresses itself to the contention that the Board in this case has abandoned the case by case approach and has tried to find a formula which is applicable in all cases.","start":439.82,"stop":452.864,"duration":13.04},{"text":"The Board did not do that in this case and we do not now urge the Court to adopt or to permit the Board to adopt any rigid formula for testing legal jurisdiction.","start":452.864,"stop":469.994,"duration":17.13},{"text":"On the other hand, of course, the importance of this case if we win it, is that the decision will establish that you don't have to go into all of the unique minutiae of every case and that you don't have to make detailed predictions as to the manner in which the labor dispute will actually affect interstate commerce somewhere along the line.","start":469.994,"stop":495.497,"duration":25.5},{"text":"It seems to us that on the basis of the facts that were cited, all of which are included in the findings of the trial examiner, in turn adopted by the Board, there clearly was jurisdiction under the prime decisions of this Court.","start":495.497,"stop":509.71,"duration":14.21},{"text":"So we are faced with the question, why wasn't the Court of Appeal satisfied?","start":509.71,"stop":514.657,"duration":4.95},{"text":"Well first of all, we notice, I'm putting the two opinions of the Court of Appeal together, the original opinion and the short opinion rendered on but now on rehearing, that the Court approached this whole question as one of statutory construction.","start":514.657,"stop":531.69,"duration":17.03},{"text":"In their supplemental opinion, they in effect conceded that Congress might constitutionally have given the Board authority over a company like Reliance on the basis of these indirect imports, but the Court felt that Congress had confined the Board within narrower limits.","start":531.69,"stop":557.038,"duration":25.35}]},{"speakerName":"Arthur J.

Claiborne","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Justice Goldberg, it is certainly true that by in effect of freezing the lower limit of the Board's discretionary standards, Congress assumed that anything above that would be within the ambit of the Commerce Clause.","start":592.116,"stop":612.187,"duration":20.07},{"text":"Of course, we can't rely too heavily on that because we knew this is a constitutional matter and congressional declarations to the contrary, we must still deal with the Commerce Clause itself.","start":612.187,"stop":623.804,"duration":11.62}]},{"speakerName":"Arthur J.

Claiborne","textObjs":[{"text":"It had.","start":632.088,"stop":632.672,"duration":0.58},{"text":"Now the Board does take this position that it is not sufficient to meet the dollar standards when those dollar standards are simply in terms of gross volume of business and had nothing whatever to do with imports or exports.","start":632.672,"stop":647.266,"duration":14.59},{"text":"And that the standards which Congress was approving, some of them, like the one in this case, since they had nothing to do with imports or exports, must be added to by an additional finding.","start":647.266,"stop":661.667,"duration":14.4},{"text":"But certainly, the congressional adoption of the Board standards which were then the same as they are now, it does show that the Court of Appeals was looking too far.","start":661.667,"stop":676.354,"duration":14.69},{"text":"But in any event, we don't have to examine this question of statutory interpretation because this Court has repeatedly held that Congress gave the Board in the NLRA as much jurisdiction as it constitutionally could.","start":676.354,"stop":690.698,"duration":14.34},{"text":"That was decided back in the days of the Edison case and Fainblatt.","start":690.698,"stop":695.333,"duration":4.63},{"text":"It was reaffirmed only recently in the Guss decision.","start":695.333,"stop":699.887,"duration":4.55},{"text":"So we view it as a constitutional question and not as a statutory interpretation question.","start":699.887,"stop":706.548,"duration":6.66},{"text":"Now perhaps this error in the Court of Appeal approach undermines the whole of their opinion.","start":706.548,"stop":713.736,"duration":7.19},{"text":"They were looking rather cautiously for an actual effect on interstate commerce in the terms of the statute.","start":713.736,"stop":722.203,"duration":8.47},{"text":"They admitted that if it were a constitutional question, it would be jurisdiction, but they thought the statute must be more narrowly construed.","start":722.203,"stop":733.197,"duration":10.99},{"text":"But facing then the constitutional question, the question still remains whether a shutdown in a business which sells locally, a product which was usually manufactured out of state affects interstate commerce in the constitutional sense.","start":733.197,"stop":750.152,"duration":16.96},{"text":"To us, the answer is obvious and it would be pointless to demonstrate that a shutdown at Reliance would tend to cut down Gulf's shipments to Long Island which in turn would affect Gulf's imports into the State of New York.","start":750.152,"stop":771.901,"duration":21.75},{"text":"So the real question is why wouldn't this natural anticipated result take place?","start":771.901,"stop":778,"duration":6.1},{"text":"The Court of Appeals had several suggestions on this point.","start":778,"stop":783.472,"duration":5.47},{"text":"These are the additional facts which they thought might be relevant in that connection.","start":783.472,"stop":788.377,"duration":4.9},{"text":"I'm now reading from their opinion at page 169 of the record.","start":788.377,"stop":793.295,"duration":4.92},{"text":"We cannot tell from the meager record before us anything about the volume of commerce in heating oils in the relevant market Gulf's

availability of ultimate distributors to Gulf and to Reliance's customers.","start":793.295,"stop":821.199,"duration":27.9},{"text":"We think that all of these additional facts which the Court of

one, Reliance's contract relationship, if any, with Gulf's national distribution system.","start":838.214,"stop":848.98,"duration":10.77},{"text":"This is an effort to assimilate this case with the Howell Chevrolet case.","start":848.98,"stop":855.584,"duration":6.6},{"text":"We can't say that it would be irrelevant if such a connection were established, but it certainly is not a necessary premise for jurisdiction.","start":855.584,"stop":866.573,"duration":10.99},{"text":"And in our particular case, there is no indication anywhere in the record that such a connection does exist and therefore no excuse for remanding simply to require us to negate what the record itself is already now suggests.","start":866.573,"stop":882.811,"duration":16.24},{"text":"And secondly, the Court was
