Cox","textObjs":[{"text":"May it please the Court.","start":6.909,"stop":8.597,"duration":1.69},{"text":"When the Court rose yesterday, I was in the middle of discussing our principle proposition here, which is that this case has so many of the characteristics common to the other restraints in trade that have been held unlawful per se, that it should be placed in the same category.","start":8.597,"stop":33.244,"duration":24.65},{"text":"In the course of that discussion, I pointed out that in many of those other cases the Court had refused to inquire into the alleged justification that it made the restraint brief, because apparently, in each of those cases, the alleged justification was something which instead of being the main point of the transaction, flowed exclusively from the restraint of competition.","start":33.244,"stop":64.096,"duration":30.85},{"text":"So that an effort was being made to argue that in this instance, competition is a bad thing or this is bad competition as opposed to good competition.","start":64.096,"stop":75.106,"duration":11.01},{"text":"I want to make it plain that our case does not depend on asserting as an absolute generalization that the Court will never -- that no case can exist in which the Court will hear the justification, that competition is a bad thing.","start":75.106,"stop":96.557,"duration":21.45},{"text":"I know of no such case, but I'm not prepared to assert that none can possibly arise.","start":96.557,"stop":103.145,"duration":6.59},{"text":"The thrust of our argument here is simply by analogy that this case is so linked the other per se restraint, especially resale price fixing and territorial, horizontal territorial allocation, that it should be placed in the same category without attempting to espouse any broader generalization.","start":103.145,"stop":125.949,"duration":22.8},{"text":"Now, let us look a little more closely at the characterizing of these territorial restrictions that White imposes on its dealers and see whether they are not the same in principle and in those respects, as the other per se restraints.","start":125.949,"stop":147.031,"duration":21.08},{"text":"First, it is clear that these territorial restrictions do eliminate competition and not merely price competition, but all competition in the sale of White trucks.","start":147.031,"stop":161.513,"duration":14.48},{"text":"That is a, plainly a restraint of trade, it serves no independent business purpose other than that of restraining trade and it imposes a very important kind of restraint.","start":161.513,"stop":174.817,"duration":13.3},{"text":"We know ever since the writings of Professor Edward Chamberlin on Monopolistic Competition that one of the tendencies in an economy increasingly dominated by a few large manufacturers has been for each to try to differentiate its product, so that it obtains at least at the manufacturers, at the distributor level, some of the characteristics of the monopolistic market.","start":174.817,"stop":200.14,"duration":25.32},{"text":"Now, if we go on and eliminate all competition in the sale of a brand on down to the public, a very important form of competition, which has effects on the price structure and everything else, is being eliminated.","start":200.14,"stop":216.563,"duration":16.42},{"text":"So there could be no doubt here that these White contracts, territorial restriction do eliminate competition in an important form.","start":216.563,"stop":227.528,"duration":10.97},{"text":"The only justifications which appellant asserts to these contracts come under the heading competition among our dealers, it is a bad thing for them, and a bad thing for us and we ask the Court to conclude that it's bad thing therefore for the public.","start":227.528,"stop":246.187,"duration":18.66},{"text":"In order to demonstrate that, that is true, I would like to be sure to depart from the argument and take White's own brief.","start":246.187,"stop":255.06,"duration":8.87},{"text":"Dealing with this point, White says first on page 11, “in some instances it is competitively effective for a manufacturer to make certain that only one dealer is selling its good to residents of a particular area.”","start":255.06,"stop":270.081,"duration":15.02},{"text":"Then we go on and the reasons appear over on pages 12 and 13.","start":270.081,"stop":275.892,"duration":5.81},{"text":"The first reason toward the bottom of page 12, “White on the strength of this kind of contract has built up substantial goodwill in its organization of independent dealers and distributors because the contracts assure that White dealers will have resources to scour their territories, but hard to get sale since they will have the security of getting the easier large volume White customers in their area.”","start":275.892,"stop":301.703,"duration":25.81},{"text":"Well this it seems to me is simply an argument our dealers feel is goodwill, because we've assured them that they won't have to compete with each other.","start":301.703,"stop":309.546,"duration":7.84},{"text":"One could make the same argument that any price fixing, any resale price fixing, any horizontal allocation of territory, it's simply they don't like to compete and they love us because we don't make them compete or because we free them from competition.","start":309.546,"stop":325.106,"duration":15.56},{"text":"Then going on, one finds next, I'm up at end of the paragraph on page 13 -- beginning on page 13, that appellant criticizes the White dealer who jumps territorial boundaries at a strategic moment and snatches away the pre-sold customers, skipping on why is that subject to criticism?","start":325.106,"stop":348.678,"duration":23.57},{"text":"Individual dealers need the cream, that is easy to get sales, that they wouldn't get if there was another White dealer competing with them, and for two reasons, not only in order to be able to sell less lucrative accounts, but also in order to have the financial strength to maintain adequate service facilities.","start":348.678,"stop":368.591,"duration":19.91},{"text":"And at another point it is said that if the dealers don't compete with each other for the more lucrative accounts, then they will be able to compete more vigorously with General Motors and Ford.","start":368.591,"stop":382.483,"duration":13.89},{"text":"I think it's fair to say that the argument is that the dealers by making more money through the elimination of competition in the sale of White trucks with other White dealers, will appellant says be able to do two things, first to compete more vigorously with other truck manufacturers and second to be able to spend more money on their service department.","start":382.483,"stop":408.472,"duration":25.99},{"text":"Now this is the kind of decision which the Sherman Act intends to be made by a free market.","start":408.472,"stop":417.58,"duration":9.11},{"text":"It's not for the appellant or with deference for a court, to say that it is better for the economy to have less money go into competition in the sale of White trucks and to have more money go into building up service departments.","start":417.58,"stop":433.046,"duration":15.47},{"text":"The whole theory of our economy and the whole theory of the Sherman Act is that the consumer shall make the choice.","start":433.046,"stop":439.71,"duration":6.66},{"text":"He may go and try and get the best price or he may go to someone who charges a little higher price and therefore get better service on his truck in later years after he buys it, and similarly the theory is that it is -- should be left to the free play of the economy to determine whether we will have inter-brand competition or intra-brand competition or what combination of the two, rather than the private persons White agreements that are serving no other purpose should come in and say no we won't have intra-brand competition, we will concentrate on inter-brand competition.","start":439.71,"stop":482.158,"duration":42.45},{"text":"Now I should say in candid that there is one other argument that has been made, although I don't find it in the appellant's brief, in support of territorial restrictions by manufacturers on dealers, which it is said do not exist where the dealers combine simply at a horizontal level.","start":482.158,"stop":502.167,"duration":20.01},{"text":"The suggestion was made by my colleague Professor Turner at Harvard that this kind of territorial restriction has the advantage of ensuring that the dealer will concentrate intensively on a certain geographical area, that getting hungry as a horse does if you confine him to too small a pasture, they won't range widely seeking to get Timothy and Clover, but will be driven to eat some of the weeds, and the leaves, the round stubble which is to the advantage of the manufacturer.","start":502.167,"stop":544.674,"duration":42.51},{"text":"Even professor Turner himself concludes that, that justification is not sufficient to offset the very marked restrictions on competition that this kind of territorial agreement imposed.","start":544.674,"stop":562.732,"duration":18.06},{"text":"A second answer is that the kind of intensive cultivation of the territory that the manufacturer is interested in can be achieved without imposing these restraints on competition, and of course it's at this point that we made certain suggestions as to what White might do.","start":562.732,"stop":583.276,"duration":20.54},{"text":"Contrary to my brother's suggestion, we never said there are other ways of restraining trade that will do the same thing that are preferable form.","start":583.276,"stop":592.396,"duration":9.12},{"text":"We said there are ways of ensuring intensive cultivation that do not impose these same restraints on trade.","start":592.396,"stop":601.37,"duration":8.97},{"text":"One way is requiring of the dealer to put in a specified amount, not a percentage, a specified amount, please these are important here, a specified amount of salesman or money or effort measured in some other way in exploiting his particular assigned territory for which he is responsible.","start":601.37,"stop":625.864,"duration":24.49},{"text":"Another measure, which would come close to accomplishing -- accomplish much of this result is through the exclusive dealership, which we do not argue is per se unlawful, which we recognize is a question dependent on the facts of each particular case, but which does give the dealer a territory for which he is responsible.","start":625.864,"stop":651.404,"duration":25.54}]},{"speakerName":"Arthur J. Goldberg","textObjs":[{"text":"[Inaudible]","start":651.404,"stop":669.966,"duration":18.56}]},{"speakerName":"Archibald Cox","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, I think there is no difficulty here certainly, because in its reply brief, White it concedes that these are reasonable alternatives to accomplish every purpose except one.","start":669.966,"stop":685.254,"duration":15.29},{"text":"It says while the suggestions of the government are relevant to keeping unzealous dealers up to the mark.","start":685.254,"stop":691.123,"duration":5.87}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What page?","start":691.123,"stop":691.773,"duration":0.65}]},{"speakerName":"Archibald Cox","textObjs":[{"text":"Page 16 of the reply brief, about half way down the main type.","start":691.773,"stop":698.413,"duration":6.64},{"text":"These suggestions scarcely touch the basic problem of how the dealers maybe kept in financial shape to fulfill the obligations.","start":698.413,"stop":708.443,"duration":10.03},{"text":"In other words, we must relieve them from competition, so that they will make more money, and then they will be in better shape to carry out the obligations that rest upon them.","start":708.443,"stop":723.679,"duration":15.24},{"text":"Now certainly this is an argument that has been rejected over and over and over again.","start":723.679,"stop":731.467,"duration":7.79},{"text":"The most precise rejection of it came in the Dr. Miles Medical Case back where the Court was speaking of course of resale price fixing, but the parallel between the argument that Mr. Gesell makes in the reply brief that we must give our White dealers, assure our White dealers more money, so that they may compete more effectively, is exactly the argument that was made by the Dr. Miles Medical Company and rejected by this Court.","start":731.467,"stop":765.099,"duration":33.63},{"text":"I would like to take a moment just to point it out.","start":765.099,"stop":768.651,"duration":3.55},{"text":"The Dr. Miles case, then Justice Hughes had said the bill asserts the importance of a standard retail price, and asserts generally that confusion and damage have resulted from sales less than the prices fixed, but the advantage of established retail price is primarily concerned with the dealers.","start":768.651,"stop":789.483,"duration":20.83},{"text":"The enlarged profits which would result from adherence to the established rates would go to them and not to the complainant.","start":789.483,"stop":796.18,"duration":6.7},{"text":"This of course is true here.","start":796.18,"stop":797.974,"duration":1.79},{"text":"It is true the inability of the favored dealers to realize these profits, on account of the described competition, that complainant works out its alleged injury, exactly the way the appellant seeks to work it out here.","start":797.974,"stop":813.443,"duration":15.47},{"text":"And then another sentence, if there be an advantage to the manufacturer in the maintenance of fixed retail prices, and we say there would be an advantage in the territorial restriction, the question remains whether it is one which he is entitled to secure by agreements restricting the freedom of trade on the part of dealers who own what they sell.","start":813.443,"stop":832.503,"duration":19.06},{"text":"As to this, the complainant can fare no better with its plan of identical contract, than could the dealers themselves if they formed a combination and endeavored to establish the same restriction, and thus to achieve the same result, by agreement with each other.","start":832.503,"stop":848.757,"duration":16.25},{"text":"If the immediate advantage they would thus obtain would not be sufficient to sustain such a direct agreement, the asserted ulterior benefit to the complainant cannot be regarded as sufficient to support its system.","start":848.757,"stop":861.466,"duration":12.71},{"text":"And then in the next paragraph the Court holds, “but agreements are combinations between dealers, having their sole purpose, the fixed prices are illegal per se” and we say, completing the analogy, that agreements amongst White's dealers to eliminate competition among themselves would under the decisions of this Court plainly be illegal per se.","start":861.466,"stop":886.132,"duration":24.67},{"text":"So that speaking more generally this argument that there are advantages through the elimination of a particular kind of competition is one that has been rejected not only in a very parallel context in the Dr. Miles case, because it was a similar argument that was rejected by Judge Rifkind in the National Lead case with respect to territorial allocations on horizontal territorial allocation.","start":886.132,"stop":920.192,"duration":34.06},{"text":"And we think, it is no different really than the arguments that have been made in support of all price fixing, are all eliminations of competition among distributors.","start":920.192,"stop":932.523,"duration":12.33},{"text":"Now, there is a second reason, why the Court has held many forms of avowed restriction on competition to be illegal per se, and that reason too we think is applicable to the present case.","start":932.523,"stop":952.036,"duration":19.51},{"text":"In the Northern Pacific case, Justice Black pointed out, that the principle of per se unreasonableness avoids the necessity for an incredibly complicated and prolonged economic investigation into the entire history of the industry involved, as well as related industries, in an effort to determine whether a particular restraint has been unreasonable, an inquiry so often fruitless when undertaken.","start":952.036,"stop":979.935,"duration":27.9},{"text":"Of course the point is in the latter part contrary to what my brother says, it is not the burden on the government approving its the case or the time or effort expended.","start":979.935,"stop":991.515,"duration":11.58},{"text":"The point is if one gets all done making the inquiry, he has virtually nothing but a very broad and virtually unanswerable question, on which experts may differ, but which to a very considerable extent is answered by the philosophy of the Sherman Act, that the allocation of resources should be determined by competition, that even if there are costs of competition in particular instances, in the long-run the gains greatly outweigh the cost.","start":991.515,"stop":1029.723,"duration":38.21},{"text":"Now this is the very kind of inquiry that my brother asks the Court to embark on in the present case.","start":1029.723,"stop":1037.261,"duration":7.54},{"text":"Let me take just one of the many questions that would have to be asked as an illustration.","start":1037.261,"stop":1043.025,"duration":5.76},{"text":"Appellant argues that although the contract suppressed, indeed eliminated intra-brand competition, they will serve inter-brand competition by enabling White better to survive he says as a competitor of the giant non-custom truck manufacturers and that if White dealers can't be sheltered from competition among each other, there will be an inevitable exodus of buyers to the giant manufacturer.","start":1043.025,"stop":1076.429,"duration":33.4},{"text":"But who is to say that inter-brand competition is to be preferred to intra-brand competition?","start":1076.429,"stop":1086.94,"duration":10.51},{"text":"Is this a justiciable question or one that the Sherman Act itself anticipates and leaves competition alone.","start":1086.94,"stop":1096.289,"duration":9.35},{"text":"Who --","start":1096.289,"stop":1097.044,"duration":0.76}]},{"speakerName":"Arthur J.

to embark on, ever since the Pottery's case where the argument was then made there Mr. Justice Goldberg, that eliminating price competition would be desirable and that other forms of competition would
