cited throughout his brief, the United States versus Maloney in 1959 where Mr. Justice Hand, Learned Hand of New York in the Second Circuit held that in a similar instance, it wasn't quite as similar

the doings of that Court stated that it was reversible error to force a witness to take the stand under those circumstances.","start":623.977,"stop":635.804,"duration":11.83},{"text":"And as in this case here, the government knew in advance as did the Court below that the Kahns who undoubtedly were essential to the government's case, but whether they are a necessity in the government's case

part.","start":678.68,"stop":703.653,"duration":24.97},{"text":"They had only pleaded guilty to conceivable bribery of a Federal Official to income tax evasion, Federal income tax evasion and they
