Amendment.","start":408.288,"stop":422.349,"duration":14.06},{"text":"Now the only authority which I know squarely deals with this point that insofar as this Court is concerned is the case of

management relations in interstate commerce as to remove the matter from the jurisdiction of the state courts.","start":464.56,"stop":490.679,"duration":26.12},{"text":"Now, in reference to the facts, the State Supreme Court said this.","start":490.679,"stop":494.529,"duration":3.85},{"text":"It seems that before this, a representative of the Labor Union approached the management of complainant and

federal preemption.","start":535.477,"stop":543.617,"duration":8.14},{"text":"Now, I would like to further point out to the Court insofar as the alleged right-to-work law is concerned that even if there was an area in which the state can act therein that the decision of where that area would lie would be for the National Labor Relations Board to determine as to whether they had jurisdiction or whether it was a matter concerning which the state could lie because it fell beyond that jurisdiction.","start":543.617,"stop":568.568,"duration":24.95},{"text":"This Court has definitely held that if a matter is even argued within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board that then the National Labor Relations Board is a proper forum to go to, to make the determination as to whether

the state court holding one way and the Labor Board holding another.","start":584.829,"stop":593.012,"duration":8.18},{"text":"Now in the case of San Diego Building Trades Council versus Garner, this

side from that issue which I think is sound in itself and determinative of the facts of the matter, I wish to respectfully submit that not only does the problem as to a question of arguability but there is no reasonable basis in the evidence for a finding that the state right-to-work laws have been violated.","start":634.294,"stop":656.481,"duration":22.19},{"text":"Of course, the Supreme Court of the State of Georgia merely saying that they have been violated would not confer jurisdiction unless the evidence established the fact that they were violated even if that would give the state court jurisdiction.","start":656.481,"stop":669.98,"duration":13.5},{"text":"This Court in the case of Plumbers and Steamfitters versus Graham said in that

present.","start":684.74,"stop":706.801,"duration":22.06},{"text":"It does not affirmatively appear in the transcript whether anyone was appearing on behalf of the plaintiff in

six months later on August the 10th, 1961.","start":737.731,"stop":750.133,"duration":12.4},{"text":"Now during the intervening months, this is what happened.","start":750.133,"stop":753.364,"duration":3.23},{"text":"The union discovered -- the union was aware of the fact, made aware of the fact that the wages were not being paid as required by the city's contract and that therefore the wages in the area were being depressed as a result of this failure to abide by the contract.","start":753.364,"stop":769.911,"duration":16.55},{"text":"Therefore, the matter was taken up with the City of Atlanta and numerous conferences were held with the city attorney and other officials of the City of Atlanta, in an effort to get the City of Atlanta to enforce its contract and require that the wage scale should be raised to conform to the contract.","start":769.911,"stop":790.422,"duration":20.51},{"text":"And the evidence is undisputed that these conferences were held that this is what transpired and the evidence is undisputed that it was affirmatively stated to the city that they were not concerning themselves in anyway with who worked on the job.","start":790.422,"stop":798.154,"duration":7.73},{"text":"But that they were concerning themselves only with the question of wages.","start":798.154,"stop":802.076,"duration":3.92},{"text":"Certainly, that would be a complete repudiation of any idea that they weren't any way seeking a violation of the state right-to-work laws.","start":802.076,"stop":810.002,"duration":7.93},{"text":"After months of such conferences without avail, as a last resort, the matter was carried to the City Board of Alderman, the final authority so far as the city was concerned and after a full hearing there, this was the minutes of the Board of Alderman.","start":810.002,"stop":824.849,"duration":14.85},{"text":"After lengthy discussion, this matter was referred to executive session where the committee agreed that there is nothing that the city legally can do so as to make Curry raise his pay scale.","start":824.849,"stop":838.29,"duration":13.44},{"text":"Not one word as to who was employed, not one intimation in the record that any request was made of the City Board of Alderman, the city attorney or anyone else in these conferences having anything to do with employment, but only the wage scale.","start":838.29,"stop":853.75,"duration":15.46},{"text":"Now the union showed the patience of Job in this matter.","start":853.75,"stop":857.161,"duration":3.41},{"text":"They resorted every possible means of getting the city to maintain the wage scale by enforcing its contract and it was only after carrying it to the highest authority in the city, all else having failed, and being turned down by the Board of Alderman that they resorted to the only remaining recourse which was to advertise to the people on the job who were being paid less than they were entitled to under the contract by means of picket signs what was going on and to present to the public the fact by their city officials who are not imposing a contract which had been enacted for the benefit of labor in this particular case.","start":857.161,"stop":894.405,"duration":37.24},{"text":"Therefore, they did erect this picket sign saying S.
