Wells, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.","start":31.402,"stop":35.285,"duration":3.88},{"text":"Texas Courts have awarded actual and punitive damages to a union member named Borden.","start":35.285,"stop":44.45,"duration":9.17},{"text":"For as the Texas Court says, “Refusal to refer him to a job offered him in the construction of the Republic Bank Building in Dallas”, we're here on certiorari challenging the Texas State jurisdiction and asserting that the conduct refusal to refer is subject to the exclusive federal regulation.","start":44.45,"stop":71.119,"duration":26.67},{"text":"We're quite close to the case which precedes this, except we don't have the supervisory problem in this case.","start":71.119,"stop":80.426,"duration":9.31},{"text":"Briefly, the facts, Borden was a member of the Plumber's Union who lived in Shreveport.","start":80.426,"stop":88.575,"duration":8.15},{"text":"Construction workers are ambulatory, he's all over every place, building.","start":88.575,"stop":94.532,"duration":5.96},{"text":"He worked for Farwell Construction Company down in Galveston and on a big hospital.","start":94.532,"stop":99.927,"duration":5.4},{"text":"This job was about to conclude and he learned down there in Galveston that this large job was coming in Dallas.","start":99.927,"stop":108.053,"duration":8.13},{"text":"He quit in Galveston and went home to Shreveport and as he said went fishing for two to three months.","start":108.053,"stop":115.218,"duration":7.17},{"text":"And then in September, came over to Dallas, as he said to go to work on the Republic Bank job, which was the biggest job in Dallas at that time.","start":115.218,"stop":125.75,"duration":10.53},{"text":"He said that it was a good job and I like to work on big work.","start":125.75,"stop":129.65,"duration":3.9},{"text":"It was a big job and I wanted it.","start":129.65,"stop":132.963,"duration":3.31},{"text":"So he went to the supervisor for Farwell who was the mechanical contractor on the Republic Bank, and was told that he would be employed if he obtained a union referral.","start":132.963,"stop":148.025,"duration":15.06},{"text":"He then came back to the Dallas local union hall.","start":148.025,"stop":152.703,"duration":4.68},{"text":"He had not obtained a clearance card from his Shreveport local, but he did have his international union due book with him.","start":152.703,"stop":162.187,"duration":9.48},{"text":"He went to the Dallas local and told the business agent, Lanham, “I'm here to go to work on the Republic Bank Building.”","start":162.187,"stop":171.569,"duration":9.38},{"text":"As Borden testified, Lanham “blow his top” and said, “You're not going to work on that bank building.","start":171.569,"stop":180.429,"duration":8.86},{"text":"You've come in here wrong.","start":180.429,"stop":182.805,"duration":2.38},{"text":"You've come in here with a job in your pocket.”","start":182.805,"stop":186.218,"duration":3.41},{"text":"Now, if I may digress briefly here, there was a contract in effect in Dallas between this local union and the Mechanical Contractors Association.","start":186.218,"stop":196.942,"duration":10.72},{"text":"Farwell was a member of that Association.","start":196.942,"stop":200.064,"duration":3.12},{"text":"It is an abbreviated contract.","start":200.064,"stop":202.127,"duration":2.06},{"text":"It's in the record.","start":202.127,"stop":202.866,"duration":0.74},{"text":"It provides wage rates and grievance procedures.","start":202.866,"stop":206.116,"duration":3.25},{"text":"It does not, in so many words, provide for a hiring hall, but it is undisputed in this record that it is the custom in Dallas for all the mechanical contractors and certainly -- well, perhaps I'm overstating the record.","start":206.116,"stop":220.504,"duration":14.39},{"text":"It is the -- it is clear that Farwell hired only through the union hiring hall as a matter of custom.","start":220.504,"stop":230.389,"duration":9.89},{"text":"Now, when Lanham, the business agent, tells Borden, the man coming in from Shreveport, “You've come in here wrong; you've come in with the job in your pocket.","start":230.389,"stop":237.774,"duration":7.38},{"text":"I'm not going to refer you.”","start":237.774,"stop":241.091,"duration":3.32},{"text":"Apparently, he, Lanham was referring to a local union rule which said that members shall not solicit work from any contractor.","start":241.091,"stop":250.103,"duration":9.01},{"text":"All the employment must be procured through the business office of the local.","start":250.103,"stop":255.455,"duration":5.35},{"text":"This is very much likely a rule which was written into the collective bargaining contract in the Teamsters Seattle-Los Angeles case which Mr. Justice Douglas wrote.","start":255.455,"stop":265.191,"duration":9.74},{"text":"And it's not an unusual provision for a building trade union to require that members seek their employment through the hiring hall rather than directly from employer.","start":265.191,"stop":278.544,"duration":13.35},{"text":"In any event, Borden was unable to get the referral to the job.","start":278.544,"stop":285.567,"duration":7.02},{"text":"He returned to Shreveport, obtained a clearance card from his Shreveport local union.","start":285.567,"stop":292.199,"duration":6.63},{"text":"And then came back to Dallas and deposited his clearance card in the Dallas local.","start":292.199,"stop":298.67,"duration":6.47},{"text":"Under the international constitution, that made him a member of the Dallas local.","start":298.67,"stop":304.696,"duration":6.03},{"text":"His card was not accepted very graciously.","start":304.696,"stop":308.363,"duration":3.67},{"text":"The business representative, Lanham said that, “I'll accept it.","start":308.363,"stop":312.278,"duration":3.92},{"text":"I have to under the Constitution, but that don't mean you're going to work by any means.”","start":312.278,"stop":317.332,"duration":5.05},{"text":"He did, however, accept the clearance card.","start":317.332,"stop":321.331,"duration":4},{"text":"Now, if I may backtrack for a moment.","start":321.331,"stop":323.678,"duration":2.35},{"text":"I indicated earlier that Borden has been working down in Galveston on a big hospital job down there several months earlier.","start":323.678,"stop":330.756,"duration":7.08},{"text":"Down there, he became friendly with a man named Thurman who was a rank-and-file employee.","start":330.756,"stop":338.057,"duration":7.3},{"text":"By the time he gets up to Dallas, Thurman is the foreman and the hiring agent for Farwell.","start":338.057,"stop":345.205,"duration":7.15},{"text":"So, Borden goes to his friend Thurman who is hiring on the Republic Bank job and says, “Call for me”, and Thurman says, “Yes, I have a job for you, but you'll need a referral.”","start":345.205,"stop":359.927,"duration":14.72},{"text":"Thurman then called Lanham, the business agent.","start":359.927,"stop":362.257,"duration":2.33},{"text":"This is the foreman calling Lanham, the business agent, and asked him to refer Borden now, and rather profanely, Mr. Lanham said, “I'm not about to send that old so and so down to the bank.","start":362.257,"stop":378.336,"duration":16.08},{"text":"He shoved his card down our throat.","start":378.336,"stop":379.972,"duration":1.64},{"text":"I'm not about to send him out to the bank.”","start":379.972,"stop":383.543,"duration":3.57},{"text":"Now, several days later, precise dates are difficult in this record.","start":383.543,"stop":387.649,"duration":4.11},{"text":"It was tried about six or seven years after the operating events and recollection on neither side were too good, but I won't dispute what my adversary says with respect to four or five days later.","start":387.649,"stop":403.4,"duration":15.75},{"text":"Borden did obtain a referral first of the Spencer Plumbing Company job where he worked until -- from September until almost Christmas, until December 17.","start":403.4,"stop":413.389,"duration":9.99},{"text":"He was laid off there when they got cut off on that job.","start":413.389,"stop":416.603,"duration":3.21},{"text":"Early in January, he was referred to keep or a plumbing job and stayed there until March or April and was laid off there.","start":416.603,"stop":423.501,"duration":6.9},{"text":"He was off for only a week or two and which he referred to the Rose Plumbing Company and without going into detail he was referred then to the Texas Plumbing Company and to the Dallas School Board.","start":423.501,"stop":433.639,"duration":10.14},{"text":"So for the year, from the time he first came to Dallas, the jury found that he would have made approximately -- what is this?","start":433.639,"stop":442.886,"duration":9.25},{"text":"$6000 as I recall, approximately $6000 had he been referred to the Republic Bank.","start":442.886,"stop":452.889,"duration":10},{"text":"But that in the interim employment to which he was referred, he made some $1900 less than he would have made, had he gone to the job which he preferred.","start":452.889,"stop":464.381,"duration":11.49},{"text":"Now, Borden didn't ever attend a union meeting.","start":464.381,"stop":468.548,"duration":4.17},{"text":"He waited for a year although he was from time to time complaining to the business agent, but as far as coming into the local union and making any complaint or going before any tribunal before which he might have gone, he waited for a year before he did anything or perhaps 10 or 11 months rather than a complete year, and hired a lawyer.","start":468.548,"stop":491.267,"duration":22.72},{"text":"Well now, of course, when he waited for a year, he got way past the six-month limitation period which is in Section 10 (b) of the Federal Act.","start":491.267,"stop":499.756,"duration":8.49},{"text":"He was foreclosed under the Federal Act because Congress had determined in the Federal Act that these disputes ought to be determined properly when recollections are fresh and when -- there can come some remedy promptly.","start":499.756,"stop":511.66,"duration":11.9},{"text":"He waited and then hired him a lawyer.","start":511.66,"stop":514.607,"duration":2.95},{"text":"The lawyer wrote the union.","start":514.607,"stop":516.431,"duration":1.82},{"text":"The Local Union Executive Board held a hearing and this is 11 months after -- perhaps, 12 months after the time he first came to Dallas.","start":516.431,"stop":527.954,"duration":11.52},{"text":"Called Borden and Lanham and the various people involved before the Local Union Executive Board and Borden testified that at that point, members of the Executive Board cursed him and abused him, and that he suffered mental diff -- or that there was mental suffering by reason of the abuse which was heaped on him a year after the event.","start":527.954,"stop":552.556,"duration":24.6},{"text":"Now, on these facts, he brought his suit alleging that he was refused appearance into the local.","start":552.556,"stop":560.761,"duration":8.2},{"text":"Now that is a membership right that he -- that the Board couldn't do anything about.","start":560.761,"stop":567.464,"duration":6.7},{"text":"And alleging number two that there was a refusal of referral to a job, and that is something that the Board can and does something about everyday.","start":567.464,"stop":577.756,"duration":10.29},{"text":"The case went off on the pleadings originally.","start":577.756,"stop":580.074,"duration":2.32},{"text":"We filed a plea to the jurisdiction.","start":580.074,"stop":582.236,"duration":2.16},{"text":"There was a finding in the State District Court that it was a matter of federal and not state concern, and it was dismissed.","start":582.236,"stop":589.519,"duration":7.28},{"text":"Borden appealed it.","start":589.519,"stop":591.134,"duration":1.62},{"text":"The Dallas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the dismissal, but while it was pending on rehearing, Gonzales came down.","start":591.134,"stop":598.502,"duration":7.37},{"text":"And this was properly called to the Texas Court's opinion -- attention and they reconsidered and held that it was a state matter and there was state jurisdiction.","start":598.502,"stop":611.143,"duration":12.64},{"text":"Then there was an appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas which does not treat of the federal preemption issue at all.","start":611.143,"stop":618.145,"duration":7},{"text":"It treats of other matters in the case.","start":618.145,"stop":621.619,"duration":3.47},{"text":"And in a lengthy opinion, the Texas Supreme Court came to the nub of what the case was about under Texas law, that it said that the allegations that Borden willfully was denied a job to which he was entitled under the rules and procedures established by the union for allocating work entitled him to maintain this suit, and remanded for a jury trial.","start":621.619,"stop":652.105,"duration":30.49},{"text":"Now, we have a special issue practice in Texas.","start":652.105,"stop":654.916,"duration":2.81},{"text":"No general verdict.","start":654.916,"stop":656.611,"duration":1.69},{"text":"The jury answered specific questions as to what had happened.","start":656.611,"stop":660.003,"duration":3.39},{"text":"The jury found that he had been promised of a job on the bank if he got a referral.","start":660.003,"stop":665.987,"duration":5.98},{"text":"That the foreman called for him -- called the union to give him a referral and the union wouldn't do it.","start":665.987,"stop":672.024,"duration":6.04},{"text":"The jury found that he was not refused clearance into the union.","start":672.024,"stop":676.448,"duration":4.42},{"text":"And in our view, that takes this membership right, individual versus union, out of the case by this favorable finding to us on that aspect of the case, but did found that he was refused a referral and that he had been damaged in the amount of approximately $1900.","start":676.448,"stop":696.928,"duration":20.48},{"text":"Now, what was the damage that they found?","start":696.928,"stop":699.19,"duration":2.26},{"text":"What was the measure?","start":699.19,"stop":700.981,"duration":1.79},{"text":"He -- the damage he would have earned if he had been allowed to work on the Republic Bank, exactly the same back pay that the Board could have given under the Federal Act.","start":700.981,"stop":712.293,"duration":11.31},{"text":"Now, counsel through his briefs has indicated that there's malice and there's some kind of general tort idea and there are other wrongs involved, but we take that he's bound by what he presented to the jury and what the jury found.","start":712.293,"stop":725.063,"duration":12.77},{"text":"And the only damage they found was the damage that is squarely within the federal remedy and the very matter that the Board would look to.","start":725.063,"stop":735.528,"duration":10.47},{"text":"In addition, the jury found $1500 worth of mental anguish and $5000 worth of punitive damages.","start":735.528,"stop":744.193,"duration":8.66},{"text":"So we, under the verdict, had $1900 of actual damage for the difference between what he has made at Republic and elsewhere, $1500 for mental anguish, and $5000 for punitive.","start":744.193,"stop":757.138,"duration":12.95},{"text":"There were post trial motions and the trial court found that mental anguish was not raised by the law in the evidence and should not have been submitted.","start":757.138,"stop":767.67,"duration":10.53},{"text":"We take it that this is a trial court finding that much of what is in our opponent's brief about ugly talk by the Executive Board or ugly talk by a union business agent is clearly out of the case because the trial court found in his judgment that it was not raised for the evidence and should not have been submitted as an issue.","start":767.67,"stop":787.788,"duration":20.12},{"text":"So, the trial court then reduced the punitive damage to the equal of the actual damage and entered a judgment against us for double what the Labor Board would have given, had the matter been before the Board.","start":787.788,"stop":804.077,"duration":16.29},{"text":"I emphasize there was no damage for the cursing, no damages for refusal to clear in to the union, and the sole damage was with respect to the refusal to refer to this job.","start":804.077,"stop":816.143,"duration":12.07},{"text":"Now, on the basis of that --","start":816.143,"stop":817.573,"duration":1.43}]},{"speakerName":"Earl
