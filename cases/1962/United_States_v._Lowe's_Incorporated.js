in the nature of the C & C contracts with television stations, it's very clear that these stations bought not specific pictures but a bundle of pictures.","start":5838.303,"stop":5849.291,"duration":10.99},{"text":"For one thing, every C & C license contained what they call the cushion

got unlimited runs of all the pictures for 10 years.","start":5903.236,"stop":5911.145,"duration":7.91},{"text":"And so, it didn't matter to a television station if out of 742 pictures, it did happen

that took place with respect to the others.","start":5920.159,"stop":5927.231,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Now, we claim that in this situation, there is no compulsion on the part of the stations to buy
