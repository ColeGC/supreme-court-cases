compromise.","start":935.51,"stop":943.762,"duration":8.25},{"text":"And there is no indication that we've been able to find on either side of this case that judge from the briefs, that any of the congressmen focused on the question, what if the judge doesn't agree with the jury.","start":943.762,"stop":961.027,"duration":17.27},{"text":"Now, we rely upon three considerations, I say, in support of our reading.","start":961.027,"stop":969.031,"duration":8},{"text":"The first of these is that in the federal system, it's certainly has been a tradition, I think a well unbroken tradition that the judge is the final arbiter of the sentence.","start":969.031,"stop":980.571,"duration":11.54},{"text":"As Justice Brennan indicated a moment ago in the federal system, it's the judge who imposes the sentence.","start":980.571,"stop":987.249,"duration":6.68},{"text":"Under the federal rules it is the judge who passes on any motion to reduce sentence and who has considerable discretion subject only to the situation where Congress has explicitly provided some mandatory minimum.","start":987.249,"stop":1005.507,"duration":18.26},{"text":"And I think the Congress was presumably aware of this tradition.","start":1005.507,"stop":1012.579,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Secondly, we refer to what this Court has called the principle or Rule of Lenity.","start":1012.579,"stop":1020.09,"duration":7.51},{"text":"Namely that where a criminal statute is equivocal, the Court will adopt the less harsh of two alternatives, and certainly, a rule which permits the judge to mitigate the penalty is the less harsh rule.","start":1020.09,"stop":1043.662,"duration":23.57},{"text":"Third, we say that if the concept that the jury's recommendation is mandatory as Judge Timbers has concluded creates serious constitutional doubts, then it would seem to us further that the precept of the statute should be read where possible to avoid those doubts comes into play.","start":1043.662,"stop":1074.943,"duration":31.28},{"text":"Now, under our view of the statute, as I think I indicated earlier, there is no significant disparity of risk or as we view it a serious basis any longer for a constitutional claim.","start":1074.943,"stop":1094.467,"duration":19.52},{"text":"If the defendant goes to trial before a jury on the issue of guilt, then under our view, the concurrence of both judge and jury is required before a capital penalty can be imposed.","start":1094.467,"stop":1111.301,"duration":16.83},{"text":"If on the other hand, he seeks to waive jury trial or plead guilty, the judge may reject that proposed waiver or plea, or if he accepts it, he may convene a jury on the issue of punishment as both federal and state judges have in the past done in these or comparable circumstances.","start":1111.301,"stop":1137.841,"duration":26.54},{"text":"So again, the capital penalty may be imposed if, but only if, jury and judge concur in that conclusion.","start":1137.841,"stop":1150.07,"duration":12.23},{"text":"Now, it may be argued that a judge, who would perhaps be inclined to follow a jury's recommendation of a death penalty, if one were made by a jury which heard the issue of guilt, might not be inclined to convene a jury if there were no jury trial on the issue of guilt.","start":1150.07,"stop":1177.191,"duration":27.12},{"text":"It seems to us that the answer to that is that the judge who would be inclined to concur in a death verdict, if one were recommended to him, would certainly regarded as his duty to have the matter go to a jury and to obtain a recommendation of which of course, he could readily accomplish either by insisting that the jury provide
