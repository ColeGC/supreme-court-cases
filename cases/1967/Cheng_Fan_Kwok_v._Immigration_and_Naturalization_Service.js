a broad interpretation of Section 106.","start":858.15,"stop":871.989,"duration":13.84},{"text":"There is a point raised in one of the cases that the Government regulations in the Yamada versus INS

Foti.","start":1177.844,"stop":1190.233,"duration":12.39},{"text":"The dominant goal of the statute and I quote, “was to abbreviate the process of judicial review of deportation orders in order to

legislative history is discussed in Foti and in our view it abundantly supports the Court's analysis.","start":1230.587,"stop":1240.46,"duration":9.87},{"text":"Now, the court below did not dispute these legislative objectives.","start":1240.46,"stop":1245.38,"duration":4.92},{"text":"However, it relied on this Court's rulings in Foti and Giova to support a determination that since motions for stay of deportation were addressed to a district director rather than a special inquiry officer, the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction.","start":1245.38,"stop":1269.441,"duration":24.06},{"text":"Now, while the Foti opinion did emphasize the special inquiry officer's role, it did so, I believe, in addressing the specific

decision.","start":1269.441,"stop":1290.87,"duration":21.43},{"text":"Indeed, in reserving the question which was later decided in Giova, the opinion of the Chief Justice in Foti stated, relating to

relief is denied.”","start":1290.87,"stop":1321.735,"duration":30.87},{"text":"Now, in the light of that reservation in the opinion of the Chief Justice, it seems to me not unreasonable to read the

the difficulty is that so far as I know and so far as the Government has indicated in it's brief, there is no statutory authority for a federal court to require the agency to hold a hearing except under Section 242 (b) so that if these actions are taken outside of 242 (b) and putting aside of course the possibility that there might be a constitutional requirement in some cases, I see no basis

the Government agrees that the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction is applicable and that the Court of Appeals in its discretion to be sure but in its discretion would have jurisdiction over both
