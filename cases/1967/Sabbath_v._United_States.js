officials and was searched, whereupon the customs officials discovered a container of cocaine concealed in his undershorts.","start":113.932,"stop":124.636,"duration":10.7},{"text":"They immediately arrested him for violations of the narcotics laws.","start":124.636,"stop":130.179,"duration":5.54},{"text":"And thereupon, they began a process of interrogation.","start":130.179,"stop":134.151,"duration":3.97},{"text":"Initially, Mr. Jones denied that he was involved in this elicit transaction with anyone else but after about three or four hours of interrogation, he admitted to the customs officers that he had actually been taken to Mexico on the preceding day by a person named Johnny, that Johnny had hired him to pick up the narcotics and bring them back to Los Angeles for delivery to Johnny and that Johnny had promised to pay him $100 if he did so.","start":134.151,"stop":164.036,"duration":29.88},{"text":"At that point, the customs officials transported Jones from San Diego to Los Angeles and at approximately at 3 o?clock in the morning, Jones in the presence of the customs officers try to telephone a number in Los Angeles which was written on a card that the police officers found in Jones?s possession when he was arrested, also on a card was the named Johnny.","start":164.036,"stop":189.07,"duration":25.03},{"text":"No one answered that telephone call and three or four other attempts were made to call that number during the early morning hours of Sunday, February 20th and again no answer was obtained.","start":189.07,"stop":201.671,"duration":12.6},{"text":"The officers then for some reason which is undisclosed by the record transported Jones back to San Diego.","start":201.671,"stop":209.699,"duration":8.03},{"text":"At 3:00 PM on the following afternoon, the officers again invited Jones to try and call the number in Los Angeles.","start":209.699,"stop":218.106,"duration":8.41},{"text":"On this occasion, the call was answered by a male voice on the other side of the line.","start":218.106,"stop":224.726,"duration":6.62},{"text":"Jones identified himself as BJ and addressed the person on the other side of the telephone as Johnny.","start":224.726,"stop":233.855,"duration":9.13},{"text":"He indicated that he was still in San Diego and that he still had the thing.","start":233.855,"stop":239.392,"duration":5.54},{"text":"Johnny then inquired whether Jones had any trouble in crossing the line.","start":239.392,"stop":243.938,"duration":4.55},{"text":"Jones indicated that he had not and Johnny said that he had been arrested when he had been down in Mexico and that was the reason he was curious as to whether or not Jones had had any trouble.","start":243.938,"stop":254.083,"duration":10.15},{"text":"Jones inquired whether Johnny was going to be in hes apartment and when Johnny said he would, Jones said well I'll come up to Los Angeles to your apartment.","start":254.083,"stop":262.04,"duration":7.96},{"text":"At that point, the agents did not attempt to verify any further any of the information which had been given to them by Jones who dwell all intents and purposes was an unreliable informant nor did they go to a magistrate in an effort to try to obtain a warrant for Johnny's arrest.","start":262.04,"stop":281.187,"duration":19.15},{"text":"Rather they transported Jones to Los Angeles.","start":281.187,"stop":284.96,"duration":3.77},{"text":"They went to the location where Johnny's apartment was.","start":284.96,"stop":289.449,"duration":4.49},{"text":"They outfitted Jones with an electronic transmitting device and they returned the container of cocaine to Jones and sent him to Johnny?s apartment.","start":289.449,"stop":300.048,"duration":10.6},{"text":"At this time the officers of which there were four or five in number took up positions near the apartment.","start":300.048,"stop":305.77,"duration":5.72},{"text":"And they attempted to overhear the conversation that took place between Jones and people inside of the apartment.","start":305.77,"stop":314.497,"duration":8.73},{"text":"Jones went to the apartment, knocked on the door and the door was answered by a woman who was visiting Johnny at that time.","start":314.497,"stop":322.118,"duration":7.62},{"text":"Jones asked if Johnny was in and the lady said that he was and that she would get him.","start":322.118,"stop":327.551,"duration":5.43},{"text":"Jones then went into the apartment and the lady closed the door to the apartment.","start":327.551,"stop":332.333,"duration":4.78},{"text":"Now, this much of the conversation was overheard by the officers who were listening to the electronic transmitting device.","start":332.333,"stop":340.471,"duration":8.14},{"text":"When Jones went into the apartment, the lady who was there called Johnny who turned out to be petitioner, from the bedroom and he came in to the living room and met with Jones.","start":340.471,"stop":352.712,"duration":12.24},{"text":"The conversation that followed was not overheard by the police officers because there was music being played in the background and this drowned out their ability to hear the conversation over the electronic transmitting device.","start":352.712,"stop":366.23,"duration":13.52},{"text":"Apparently, the officers in Los Angeles did not have available to them some of the more sophisticated means of bugging that this Court has just heard about and they therefore were frustrated in their efforts to hear what went on in the apartment and to make the recording of that conversation.","start":366.23,"stop":382.252,"duration":16.02},{"text":"One of the officers did testify that he heard one of the people in the apartment mentioned the word ?package? though he could not identify which of the two people mentioned that word.","start":382.252,"stop":393.121,"duration":10.87},{"text":"And the other person made a response, though he also could not identify or make out what the response was.","start":393.121,"stop":399.69,"duration":6.57},{"text":"At this point after Jones had been in the apartment for approximately five to ten minutes, the officers decided that because they could not make a recording of the conversation that was going on within the apartment that they should then proceed into the apartment to make the arrest.","start":399.69,"stop":416.475,"duration":16.79},{"text":"Three or four officers approached the door of the apartment.","start":416.475,"stop":419.685,"duration":3.21},{"text":"The officer in charge of the group knocked on the door, waited a few seconds, when there was no reply, he turned the knob of the door, the door being unlocked he opened it and rushed into the apartment with his gun drawn.","start":419.685,"stop":431.685,"duration":12},{"text":"He was immediately followed by two or three other officers at least one of who, also had his gun drawn.","start":431.685,"stop":438.307,"duration":6.62},{"text":"There was no announcement by the police at least the record discloses that their was no announcement by the police that any of the officers announced who they were, what their purpose was or what their authority was before entering the apartment.","start":438.307,"stop":452.452,"duration":14.14},{"text":"Once inside of the apartment, the officers observed petitioners sitting on the couch, dressed only in his underclothes and Jones sitting on a chair next to the couch.","start":452.452,"stop":463.526,"duration":11.07},{"text":"As they entered one of the officers indicated that he saw a petitioner withdraw his hand from underneath the cushion of the couch.","start":463.526,"stop":471.526,"duration":8},{"text":"They immediately announced that both petitioner and Jones were under arrest.","start":471.526,"stop":476.067,"duration":4.54},{"text":"They took petitioner from the couch, placed him against the wall, put him in handcuffs, searched him, searched Jones and then undertook a general and comprehensive search of the entire apartment.","start":476.067,"stop":488.085,"duration":12.02},{"text":"In the course of that search, they found the container of narcotics and under the cushion of the couch near where the petitioner had been sitting.","start":488.085,"stop":496.849,"duration":8.76},{"text":"They also found in other rooms of the apartment certain evidence which was not introduced at petitioners trial but which was testified about specifically some squares, aluminum squares and some balloons which the police officer indicated were customarily used in the elicit trade of narcotics.","start":496.849,"stop":518.457,"duration":21.61},{"text":"The officers then placed both petitioner and Jones under arrest and took them from the apartment.","start":518.457,"stop":526.469,"duration":8.01},{"text":"Mr. Jones did not have on his person the $100.00 which he claimed petitioner had promised to give him if he had delivered the narcotics.","start":526.469,"stop":535.89,"duration":9.42},{"text":"At the trial, when the government attempted to introduce the container of narcotics, the petitioners counsel objected in a rather general fashion.","start":535.89,"stop":549.854,"duration":13.96},{"text":"He indicated that principally the police did not have probable cause to enter the apartment when they did to make the arrest.","start":549.854,"stop":556.995,"duration":7.14},{"text":"He also objected to the fact that the police entered the apartment without a warrant and his discussion or his general lodging of the objection also contained a reference to the fact that the police broke into the apartment.","start":556.995,"stop":569.875,"duration":12.88},{"text":"The District Court denied the objection, had admitted the narcotics into evidence and an appeal from his conviction.","start":569.875,"stop":577.853,"duration":7.98},{"text":"The conviction was affirmed, the Court of Appeals sustaining the District Court's admission of the narcotics into evidence.","start":577.853,"stop":585.983,"duration":8.13},{"text":"Now, the petitioner today principally contends that the arrest of the petitioner was unlawful and that the search which was conducted subsequent to that arrest was also unlawful thereby requiring that the narcotics should have been excluded from the trial.","start":585.983,"stop":603.744,"duration":17.76},{"text":"The basic reason for the illegality of the arrest is the fact that the officers when they broke in to petitioner's apartment did not comply with the requirements of 18 USC Section 3109 which indicates that an officer may break in to an apartment to effect an arrest but only if he first announces his authority and his purpose for breaking in.","start":603.744,"stop":628.763,"duration":25.02}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Bring, Section 3109 by its terms applies only to what an officer may do to
