just before the case came to trial about three years later, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, in which it said that the District Court had no power to grant the type of order prayed for.","start":91.358,"stop":113.944,"duration":22.59},{"text":"That is an order in the nature of a mandamus.","start":113.944,"stop":118.815,"duration":4.87},{"text":"The District Court agreed with the contention of the defendant, dismissed the complaint.","start":118.815,"stop":125.208,"duration":6.39},{"text":"We appealed to the circuit court which also agreed with the contention of the defendant.","start":125.208,"stop":134.127,"duration":8.92},{"text":"Judge Smith wrote the opinion.","start":134.127,"stop":135.911,"duration":1.78},{"text":"It was concurred in by Judge Freedman and Judge Ganey wrote a dissenting opinion.","start":135.911,"stop":144.654,"duration":8.74},{"text":"This appeal then followed.","start":144.654,"stop":149.932,"duration":5.28},{"text":"Under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, a stockholder is given the right to examine the books of the corporation at reasonable times and for reasonable purposes.","start":149.932,"stop":165.806,"duration":15.87},{"text":"The statutes of the State of Pennsylvania then go on to say that this right to examine the books may be enforced by what is called a writ of mandamus.","start":165.806,"stop":180.848,"duration":15.04},{"text":"Though I surmise that if the statutes had not said so, that the courts in the State of Pennsylvania would probably have found some other method of enforcing this writ either by way of an equity proceeding or by conforming some common law writ of the state.","start":180.848,"stop":202.579,"duration":21.73},{"text":"Now, the courts further have held, that is the courts of the State of Pennsylvania, that the courts of equity in that state can not enforce this right because there is a remedy at law.","start":202.579,"stop":223.266,"duration":20.69},{"text":"But the courts inequity will enforce the right if some other relief is called for or is asked for.","start":223.266,"stop":230.579,"duration":7.31},{"text":"This case we asked for no other relief.","start":230.579,"stop":233.527,"duration":2.95},{"text":"We asked merely to examine the books.","start":233.527,"stop":238.008,"duration":4.48},{"text":"The District Court and circuit court said, Well the State of Pennsylvania calls this a writ of mandamus, you are asking for an order in the nature of a writ of mandamus, we have no right to grant this.","start":238.008,"stop":254.634,"duration":16.63},{"text":"And this position arises in the following manner.","start":254.634,"stop":259.171,"duration":4.54},{"text":"The District Courts being courts of inferior jurisdiction, of course had only the power granted, or rather the jurisdiction granted to them by Congress.","start":259.171,"stop":274.854,"duration":15.68},{"text":"Now, Congress in the original -- under the original judiciary acts and subsequently, has granted the District Court?s jurisdiction in civil matters.","start":274.854,"stop":290.707,"duration":15.85},{"text":"In the first cases which arose on this subject, case of McIntire-Wood -- of the McIntire and Wood McClung versus Sullivan, decided that the -- under this statute the District Courts had no right to grant a writ of mandamus.","start":290.707,"stop":313.303,"duration":22.6},{"text":"In those cases what was prayed for was an order against a land registrar to register a deed.","start":313.303,"stop":320.802,"duration":7.5},{"text":"A land registrar was an executive officer of the federal government.","start":320.802,"stop":325.81,"duration":5.01},{"text":"The courts or rather the Supreme Court in those cases said, We are given civil? -- or rather ?the District Court is given civil jurisdiction.\"","start":325.81,"stop":339.917,"duration":14.11},{"text":"This is a writ against an executive officer.","start":339.917,"stop":344.659,"duration":4.74},{"text":"This is not civil jurisdiction.","start":344.659,"stop":349.176,"duration":4.52},{"text":"So the point in those early cases was not that the District Courts did not have a right to issue a mandatory order.","start":349.176,"stop":361.365,"duration":12.19},{"text":"The point was that the District Courts did not have a right to issue an order against an executive officer of the federal government, because it was considered that this was in the nature of the old prerogative writ of mandamus and was not the jurisdiction which Congress wished to confer upon the District Courts of the United States.","start":361.365,"stop":390.91,"duration":29.55},{"text":"Now, these cases were followed by cases which dealt with the enforcement of the payments of debts by the states.","start":390.91,"stop":404.903,"duration":13.99},{"text":"A case such as Rosenbaum and Bauer I mentioned in my brief dealt with the question of forcing the state officer to pay bonds.","start":404.903,"stop":416.127,"duration":11.22},{"text":"And the usual manner in which the state and municipal debts are collected is by a writ of mandamus in the states against those particular officers.","start":416.127,"stop":428.75,"duration":12.62},{"text":"And the courts have held that in diversity cases, the federal courts have no right to issue this type of order against the state officers again on the ground that this is in the nature of the old prerogative writ.","start":428.75,"stop":452.481,"duration":23.73},{"text":"This concerns the interference of the judiciary with the executive branches.","start":452.481,"stop":457.544,"duration":5.06},{"text":"It concerns the problem of the federal government versus the state government, and for these reasons, it was felt that the Congress never intended the District Courts to have power to interfere in these very delicate matters.","start":457.544,"stop":476.652,"duration":19.11},{"text":"The next case decided on this subject by the Supreme Court was the Knapp case.","start":476.652,"stop":482.558,"duration":5.91},{"text":"The Knapp case dealt with the construction of certain features the Interstate Commerce Act and the question on that case was whether a writ of mandamus could be granted requiring the railroad to publish a tariff.","start":482.558,"stop":504.654,"duration":22.1},{"text":"The court in that case said that, We weren't given this right that is the District Court is not given this right by the Act and besides there are equitable revenues under the Act by which the saying resell could be reached.","start":504.654,"stop":520.782,"duration":16.13},{"text":"I?m not quite certain why that was so important in those days, why it was so important for the federal court to say that we can do this by way of equity and we cannot do it by way of mandamus.","start":520.782,"stop":539.36,"duration":18.58},{"text":"And I suppose it is because they thought in terms of causes of action rather than in terms of rights and remedies as we do today.","start":539.36,"stop":551.887,"duration":12.53},{"text":"Nevertheless, that case, I think, is one which does not deal with ordinary civil litigation and does not come within the meaning of the word civil jurisdiction.","start":551.887,"stop":573.21,"duration":21.32},{"text":"These are the cases which the Supreme Court has decided.","start":573.21,"stop":578.053,"duration":4.84},{"text":"In the lower courts, there are -- there have recently been, since the 1960s a few cases at which the lower courts have said, We are bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court which stated that we have no power to issue a writ of mandamus.","start":578.053,"stop":604.444,"duration":26.39},{"text":"These cases are very often dealt with cases of officials either of the state or of the federal government.","start":604.444,"stop":613.957,"duration":9.51},{"text":"And those cases I think also do not come within the terms civil jurisdiction.","start":613.957,"stop":618.955,"duration":5},{"text":"However, there were a few cases in the lower court where they decided that they didn't have the right to issue a writ of mandamus in a case where an ordinary mandatory order in civil litigation was prayed for.","start":618.955,"stop":636.662,"duration":17.71},{"text":"Cases similar to this one, cases in which a stockholder wanted to examine the books of a corporation.","start":636.662,"stop":646.291,"duration":9.63},{"text":"It is our position that merely because the State of Pennsylvania enforces this right by what it terms a writ of mandamus, and merely because the same word mandamus is applied to different things that the right of the District Court to issue that type of order is not limited -- that was never intended to be limited by Congress.","start":646.291,"stop":682.126,"duration":35.83},{"text":"If you state the proposition in this way, if you say, Congress never intended the District Courts to have the power to issue a mandatory order in private civil litigation where it is requested by one individual against another, I think the question answers itself, because the mere statement of that question which shows that the courts would be so inhibited in granting relief under modern conditions that is impossible for Congress ever to have desired such an end.","start":682.126,"stop":731.221,"duration":49.1},{"text":"It is our position that the District Courts do not have a right generally to issue mandatory orders against public or state officials except as modified by a recent Act in 1962, but that they do have the right to issue orders against individuals to enforce purely private rights and private litigation.","start":731.221,"stop":765.535,"duration":34.31},{"text":"Now, the dissenting judge in the Circuit Court of Appeals approached the problem in a slightly different manner.","start":765.535,"stop":776.289,"duration":10.75},{"text":"He said or he inferred that under the present rules, there are no -- there is no differentiation between actions at law in equity, we only have civil actions.","start":776.289,"stop":793.068,"duration":16.78},{"text":"And if a mandatory order is asked for, who is to say whether it's asked for at law or whether it?s asked for in equity.","start":793.068,"stop":801.173,"duration":8.11},{"text":"The mere fact that the state says that you do it by an action and mandamus at law doesn't bind us here.","start":801.173,"stop":809.192,"duration":8.02},{"text":"We have a right under the doctrine of the York case and under the general doctrines of the federal courts to make up our own enforcement laws unless they are specifically prohibited to us.","start":809.192,"stop":827.901,"duration":18.71},{"text":"There certainly is nothing in the statutes which inhibits the District Court from making a mandatory order.","start":827.901,"stop":839.22,"duration":11.32},{"text":"The statutes merely say that the District Courts shall have civil jurisdiction.","start":839.22,"stop":846.294,"duration":7.07},{"text":"Everything else with regard to mandatory orders and private litigation is substantive which has been added only by the lower courts under, I believe the mistaken impression that the word mandamus so taints a mandatory order of any kind that the lower courts, District Courts have no right to grant that writ.","start":846.294,"stop":873.015,"duration":26.72}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Freeman, I doubt if this is relevant but why didn't you go into the state
