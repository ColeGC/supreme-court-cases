so.","start":281.112,"stop":284.999,"duration":3.89},{"text":"But she also said that she was still in love with Arthwell Hayton and this immediately after her husband's death and that she felt that Arthwell Hayton would come to her at an appropriate time, that she hope to take the insurance money, $100,000.00 which was carried on her husband and take the children to Europe although it was explained that this was to avoid being crucified by the society that had put her to trial.","start":284.999,"stop":312.49,"duration":27.49},{"text":"At the time of trial, the Government proposed to use this tainted evidence.","start":312.49,"stop":319.378,"duration":6.89},{"text":"I point this out because the harmless error rule which is at issue here today has been carved out in my judgment and from a reading of the Chapman and Fahy cases and the notions expressed therein in order to avoid summary reversal where a comparatively minor piece of evidence is led in through a blunder on the part of the prosecutor or the part of the judge and an expensive retrial needs to be avoided because no substantial prejudice results.","start":319.378,"stop":346.154,"duration":26.78},{"text":"But I do

felt that would show her guilt.","start":360.6,"stop":380.029,"duration":19.43},{"text":"Anomalously, the prosecutor comes before this Court and says that the evidence was unnecessary and not prejudicial.","start":380.029,"stop":386.515,"duration":6.49},{"text":"I do point out that no other evidence demonstrated Mrs. Miller's alleged continuing love for the paramour Hayton after her husband's death.","start":386.515,"stop":396.269,"duration":9.75},{"text":"Something calculated to enrage the jury and presumably since it took three days for this jury to decide the case, somebody was enraged because the verdict was conviction.","start":396.269,"stop":407.181,"duration":10.91},{"text":"At the time that the evidence was offered, the defense counsel exhibited some surprise and

principle.","start":423.707,"stop":437.756,"duration":14.05},{"text":"Interviewed the witness in the following morning, the prosecutor put her on the stand but before that happened, the defense counsel said to the judge, It is unfair to make me object before the jury.","start":437.756,"stop":447.371,"duration":9.62},{"text":"Obviously, they might draw some inference that I am keeping out a confession or an admission that the crime was committed.","start":447.371,"stop":455.179,"duration":7.81},{"text":"And he said specifically and this is in the record, Judge you know that it isn't right to make me do that.","start":455.179,"stop":460.927,"duration":5.75},{"text":"And the judge said, We must put her on.","start":460.927,"stop":462.987,"duration":2.06},{"text":"Have a preliminary

counsel always carries the dual burden of protecting a record and persuading the jury of his client's innocence if he can, this counsel, Mr. Foley, felt that the ruling of the trial court that he must object in the presence of the jury was incorrect and that he had preserved his rights for appeal as I suggest he did and therefore, he did not take that objection in order not I think, to cause the jury to suspect that something meaty was being kept from him.","start":512.525,"stop":540.942,"duration":28.42},{"text":"From these circumstances, two questions had been accepted by this Court for a review.","start":540.942,"stop":545.153,"duration":4.21},{"text":"Was the procedure by means of which these admissions were obtained by the State of California an unconstitutional violation of

ruling.","start":651.414,"stop":655.621,"duration":4.21},{"text":"There was no ruling on this because as I understand it, because the judge said he'll have to make it in front of the

Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"So really, what you're urging us to hold is that the judges' refusal to permit objection to be made and therefore the judge's failure to make a ruling on the objection made at the sidebar was excuse, was an adequate excuse for the objection not being made in the presence of the jury.","start":672.203,"stop":698.874,"duration":26.67}]},{"speakerName":"Lee Bailey","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, Your Honor, I am.","start":698.874,"stop":699.797,"duration":0.92},{"text":"I think the principle of Jackson against Denno is applicable and I think that because jurors do not necessarily understand the machinations of the rules of evidence.","start":699.797,"stop":708.106,"duration":8.31},{"text":"If counsel wishes to state his position which is probably the better procedure at the sidebar instead of giving a speech in front of the jury and to make his objections there that he may properly do so and the judge refuses to let him is forcing him to prejudice his case in front of the jury simply because they don't understand rulings of law and we should presume that they don't at least not in our cases.","start":708.106,"stop":728.346,"duration":20.24},{"text":"Now, the third issue was offered to this Court and that is whether or not assuming that it were found that harmless error could occur with respect to admissions whether or not the error in this case was harmless.","start":728.346,"stop":739.596,"duration":11.25},{"text":"That issue was rejected and is not before the Court and so the further facts of the case which are recited by the State of California to the tune of about 250 pages, trying to show that the error was not harmless, will not be alluded to by the petitioner who believes that issue to have been deemed irrelevant.","start":739.596,"stop":759.068,"duration":19.47},{"text":"The question then before this Court is whether or not I take it to the State of California although it vacillates very sharply between its briefs and its letters to this Court.","start":759.068,"stop":768.1,"duration":9.03},{"text":"In the final analysis at least does not approve this deceptive procedure and at one point said flatly in a letter the Court which we have quoted in our briefs and which is part of the record, we did not mean to say that this was not an unconstitutional procedure, we condemn it.","start":768.1,"stop":787.941,"duration":19.84},{"text":"Assuming that it is a constitutional violation and I see no reason to quarrel with that if this were to occur today very obviously, it would be under the Miranda Rule that we are not favored with that because of the time of our trial, the trial was in January of 1965.","start":787.941,"stop":802.667,"duration":14.73},{"text":"Nonetheless, under Escobedo and under Massiah which involved very similar circumstances and where there was counsel to represent the defendant, these procedures have been condemned to say that it is not a constitutional violation will invite this kind of deception every time law enforcement is frustrated by the rules that this Court has created to protect individuals who are subject to interrogation.","start":802.667,"stop":828.979,"duration":26.31},{"text":"To go in through the back door demolishes any value in creating a strong front door and that is exactly what would happen.","start":828.979,"stop":835.762,"duration":6.78},{"text":"I see perilously little difference between my planting a spy in the District Attorney's office to pose as his secretary and steal his files and the sheriff planting a spy in a cell where my client is improperly held if she is innocent or being properly held is not suppose to

get.","start":835.762,"stop":861.08,"duration":25.32},{"text":"If it is a constitutional violation could it ever be harmless, well, the Court has held I think pretty uniformly that confessions will not be assumed to be harmless and can admissions be harmless.","start":861.08,"stop":873.335,"duration":12.25},{"text":"This type of admission certainly can never be harmless because it is an admission to the motive in the case.","start":873.335,"stop":879.815,"duration":6.48},{"text":"The murder case of this sort is on shaky ground without some motive.","start":879.815,"stop":883.316,"duration":3.5},{"text":"Obviously, if the State had been faced with a situation where two happy church going people with a stable family, a nice community

Honor.","start":914.123,"stop":916.078,"duration":1.95},{"text":"But the question before the jury was did she on the night in question have sufficient malice in her heart and sufficient motive to burn her husband up, her contention was that this affair had terminated and was not a motive.","start":916.078,"stop":927.062,"duration":10.98},{"text":"The only piece of evidence that clearly contradicted her testimony was the testimony of Peggy Fisk saying, I still love Arthwell Hayton.","start":927.062,"stop":934.832,"duration":7.77},{"text":"If the jury believed that, the motive was a continuing thing.","start":934.832,"stop":937.904,"duration":3.07},{"text":"If they did not, they might have had a reasonable doubt as to whether this affair had terminated and having had that dealt the result would have been quite different.","start":937.904,"stop":945.519,"duration":7.62},{"text":"If the Court were to say that there can be harmless error in admissions, I think a number of serious problems would crop up.","start":945.519,"stop":952.165,"duration":6.65},{"text":"It would require a case by case adjudication and an onerous burden.","start":952.165,"stop":956.798,"duration":4.63},{"text":"It would tempt law enforcement to use tactics of this sort in the fun hope that perhaps on appeal, this would be deemed to one of the exceptional cases.","start":956.798,"stop":966.381,"duration":9.58},{"text":"And I think that either of those procedures would hurt not only the cause of justice but the consistency of our constitutional principle.","start":966.381,"stop":974.362,"duration":7.98},{"text":"Now, very frankly, the best rule would be in my judgment to absolutely deter conduct of this kind because I'm very fearful of the analogous case where the evidence is not used and the counsel never learns that a spy has been used in the cell.","start":974.362,"stop":990.413,"duration":16.05},{"text":"Would the fruits of those conversations if they led to other evidence, unconstitutionally obtained, be improper and how would the defendant ever know it?","start":990.413,"stop":999.193,"duration":8.78},{"text":"This prosecutor elected to use the evidence.","start":999.193,"stop":1001.939,"duration":2.75},{"text":"If he had not, the petitioner

attention.","start":1001.939,"stop":1013.082,"duration":11.14},{"text":"I believe that it should be stamped out of that level but if not, if this conduct is permissible, if law enforcement officers may make the attempt to put spies in cells because some people can't make bail because the charges capital or because they don't have money then they will certainly do so if the Court gives one wink of approval on it.","start":1013.082,"stop":1035.487,"duration":22.41},{"text":"And then we must always decide whether or not if they don't use the evidence, they are within the limits of constitutional doctrine.","start":1035.487,"stop":1043.595,"duration":8.11},{"text":"If they do use the evidence, this is not the kind of blunder, the kind of mistake made in the heat of trial that

violation.","start":1054.721,"stop":1066.955,"duration":12.23},{"text":"But where the deception and the violation in the first instance was deliberate and conceived as an effort to get around the exercise of a constitutional right, and then where the use of the evidence by a knowing lawyer who presumably understood the law and was willing to run the risk of reversal to have his jury conviction
