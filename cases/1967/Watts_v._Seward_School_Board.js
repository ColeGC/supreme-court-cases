Alaska which have found the dismissal of petitioners as teachers in the public schools of Seward, Alaska.","start":40.035,"stop":51.285,"duration":11.25},{"text":"Both petitioners were active and a group of teachers who opposed policy of the school board and of its superintendent Mr. Fibricious (ph).","start":51.285,"stop":62.157,"duration":10.87},{"text":"In March 1960, the school board notified petitioners that their contracts would not be renewed and advised them of their rights under the Teacher Tenure Law to a hearing and of the charges against it.","start":62.157,"stop":79.858,"duration":17.7},{"text":"After petitioners discharge was sustained within the state school system, they brought suit in the state courts to obtain judicial review of this determination.","start":79.858,"stop":92.328,"duration":12.47},{"text":"After a lengthy litigation which included a summary reversal in this Court, the Supreme Court of Alaska on December 7, 1966 by 2:1 vote rendered the judgment now under review.","start":92.328,"stop":109.91,"duration":17.58},{"text":"The Court held that both petitioners were properly discharged because in May 1959 they prepared and circulated to the public what was called an open letter to the Seward School Board.","start":109.91,"stop":125.994,"duration":16.08},{"text":"This letter was signed by the Seward local of the American Federation of Teachers, of which petitioner Blue was President and petitioner Watts was Secretary.","start":125.994,"stop":136.883,"duration":10.89},{"text":"The letter as reprinted is in appendix in the petitioner’s brief.","start":136.883,"stop":141.119,"duration":4.24},{"text":"It starts up by saying that it was the union’s way of informing the school board and the public and I quote, “Of our stand in the current struggle for a good school.","start":141.119,"stop":152.306,"duration":11.19},{"text":"We hold the incidents occurring during the last year have reached such proportions as to be definitely detrimental to morale of our teaching staff and the effectiveness of our educational system.”","start":152.306,"stop":166.13,"duration":13.82},{"text":"The letter then recited some of these incidents, most of which cited around the school Superintendent.","start":166.13,"stop":172.725,"duration":6.59},{"text":"Impairment of job security was the main theme of the letter.","start":172.725,"stop":176.984,"duration":4.26},{"text":"The Superintendent had repeatedly threatened teachers with the loss of jobs and some teachers had already lost their jobs.","start":176.984,"stop":184.65,"duration":7.67},{"text":"The letter objected also that the administration created tension and friction in the school, teachers had been subjected to undignified treatment, the Fire regulations had been disregarded and discussed some other matters of perhaps less important.","start":184.65,"stop":199.777,"duration":15.13},{"text":"The union explained in its letter that the teachers had sought to resolve these problems privately, but that the school board had refused to meet with them.","start":199.777,"stop":209.889,"duration":10.11},{"text":"The letter therefore requested an immediate public meeting with the school board at which the union would press for substantial improvements and administrative policies and set forth certain specific demands.","start":209.889,"stop":225.809,"duration":15.92},{"text":"At the hearing on their dismissal both petitioners testified that they had prepared the open letter because all other avenues of recourse within the school system had been blocked.","start":225.809,"stop":240.753,"duration":14.94},{"text":"They felt the need to inform and solicit the support of the electorate to which the school board and the teachers were ultimately responsible.","start":240.753,"stop":252.244,"duration":11.49},{"text":"Now the discharge of petitioner Blue rests exclusively on his part in publishing this open letter to which I have referred.","start":252.244,"stop":263.913,"duration":11.67},{"text":"But the Supreme Court of Alaska held against Watts for an additional reason.","start":263.913,"stop":268.888,"duration":4.97},{"text":"The Court accepted a finding by the school board that Watts had met with two teachers Mr. and Mrs. (Inaudible) and now I quote the finding, “Ask them if they would go along with the group”, of which Watts was a representative whose purpose was to oust the Superintendent of Schools.","start":268.888,"stop":290.402,"duration":21.51},{"text":"The statutory basis for the Court’s ruling that Watts was subject to discharge for this conversation, was that this was immorality within the meaning of the Alaskan tenure statute.","start":290.402,"stop":303.674,"duration":13.27},{"text":"The Court construed immorality as including all conduct from the commission of the most highness felony down the scale of infamy to social misbehavior.","start":303.674,"stop":316.847,"duration":13.17},{"text":"And to this definition the distribution of the open letter was also found to be immoral conduct.","start":316.847,"stop":323.224,"duration":6.38},{"text":"But the Court ruled further that the distribution of the open letter also violated a school board regulation which described the procedure for processing grievances.","start":323.224,"stop":335.458,"duration":12.23},{"text":"It is our position that it is authoritatively construed by the Supreme Court of Alaska, both the immorality provision of the statute and the regulation on which petitioner’s discharge is based were both hopelessly and unconstitutionally vague and that they were also unconstitutionally over broad.","start":335.458,"stop":355.752,"duration":20.29},{"text":"We contend further that petitioner’s discharge violates the First Amendment.","start":355.752,"stop":361.703,"duration":5.95},{"text":"A circular or open letter which discusses and criticizes the administration of the public schools contributes to debate on public issues.","start":361.703,"stop":372.101,"duration":10.4},{"text":"Its publication is the exercise of Freedom of Speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.","start":372.101,"stop":378.076,"duration":5.98},{"text":"An invitation to join a group was subjective as the oust of a public official is of the essence of the First Amendment Freedom of Association.","start":378.076,"stop":388.211,"duration":10.13},{"text":"The central question presented by this case therefore is whether petitioners maybe discharged for the exercise of these First Amendment Rights because the public officials who were involved were their own superiors within the school system.","start":388.211,"stop":406.732,"duration":18.52},{"text":"The decisions of this Court make it clear that these First Amendment Rights do not exist for the sole benefit of those who exercise it.","start":406.732,"stop":415.704,"duration":8.97},{"text":"They are essential to the wellbeing of a democratic society.","start":415.704,"stop":419.767,"duration":4.06},{"text":"The public schools are not the exclusive domain of the school boards and school superintendents, they affect the entire community and are properly a subject of continuing public concern.","start":419.767,"stop":432.921,"duration":13.15},{"text":"We stress this point obvious though it is because the Court below and respondents in its brief have treated this case as it were simply a contest between these petitioners and the school board.","start":432.921,"stop":447.699,"duration":14.78},{"text":"We think that even on this narrow view, petitioners would be entitled to prevail, because this Court has now discredited the document, that public employees maybe forced to abandon either their jobs or their constitutional rights.","start":447.699,"stop":463.651,"duration":15.95},{"text":"But the decision below is erroneous for the more fundamental reason that it fails to take into account the strong public interest in the availability of information regarding the public schools.","start":463.651,"stop":480.845,"duration":17.19},{"text":"In New York Times against Sullivan this Court sharply circumscribed the permissible scope of liable actions brought by public officials against their critics.","start":480.845,"stop":492.155,"duration":11.31},{"text":"The basis of this decisions, we understand was that the fear of damage of wards would cause even good faith critics to withhold their criticism and would thereby deafen the vigor of public debate, contrary to the central policy in the First Amendment.","start":492.155,"stop":510.97,"duration":18.82},{"text":"And we submit self censorship by public employees because they feel the loss of their jobs is equally destructive of the values inherent in the First Amendment.","start":510.97,"stop":523.113,"duration":12.14},{"text":"Mr. Blue had taught at the Public Schools of Alaska for 15 years before he was discharged.","start":523.113,"stop":529.151,"duration":6.04},{"text":"Mr. Watts had taught for eight years.","start":529.151,"stop":532,"duration":2.85},{"text":"With their example, before that no teachers would have the temerity to risk the same fate by voicing any public objection to the actions of the school.","start":532,"stop":545.625,"duration":13.63},{"text":"To affirm the judgment below would not only penalize petitioners for the exercise of their First Amendment rights, it would cut off from the multitude of times a discussion of issues affecting the public schools, teachers who have a particular information, insight and training which can make -- which enables them to make a substantial and unique contribution to their discussion.","start":545.625,"stop":575.545,"duration":29.92},{"text":"Now for these reasons, we submit that the laws, the discharge of these petitioners would substantially interfere with the objectives of First Amendment.","start":575.545,"stop":590.72,"duration":15.18},{"text":"But we recognize also that this Court has refused to give dogmatic approval to every exercise of First Amendment rights regardless of its consequences.","start":590.72,"stop":601.679,"duration":10.96},{"text":"And we therefore do not contend that public employee may never be disciplined where his exercise of First Amendment rights is directed against his own superior.","start":601.679,"stop":613.849,"duration":12.17},{"text":"That is we can envision that some situation would arise in which the kind of activities which involve in this case might have such a serious impact on the morale and discipline of the public school system or with regard to other public employees, to the administration of government generally, that there would be the kind of an overriding public interest, which might justify the subordination of the First Amendment.","start":613.849,"stop":647.659,"duration":33.81},{"text":"But the principle that this Court has established is that the First Amendment right is entitled to prevail, unless the state can show a subordinating interest which is compelling.","start":647.659,"stop":662.319,"duration":14.66},{"text":"And the formulation that we think is particularly analogous to this case is that Wood against Georgia.","start":662.319,"stop":671.771,"duration":9.45},{"text":"In Wood, it was decided that public criticism of the judge maybe punish this contemptuous only if the Court can show and I quote in Your Honor’s opinion, “A substantive evil actually designed to impede the courts of justice”.","start":671.771,"stop":689.293,"duration":17.52},{"text":"Now we submit that where the claim is made, as it is by respondents in this case that the First Amendment right should be held before in the interest of the administration, some other branch of government than the administration of justice by the Courts the same formulation should be applied.","start":689.293,"stop":712.743,"duration":23.45},{"text":"And we submit that the school board has not come close to showing that petitioners created a substantive evil actually designed to interfere with the operation of the schools, or has it demonstrated to injury to any other legitimate overriding interest?","start":712.743,"stop":728.993,"duration":16.25},{"text":"I would invite Your Honor’s attention to page 66 of the Appendix, which is reprinted in the footnote of page 38 of our brief, where the Court below described what it considered to be the interest that would justify the discharge of petitioners for circulating the open letter, here is what the Court said.","start":728.993,"stop":755.336,"duration":26.34},{"text":"The overall binding effect of the widespread circulation of the false statements and the highhanded method employed to seek redress and disregard of established procedures could only result in a loss of respect by the public for appellants and the teaching profession in general, when all of the facts became known and was immoral conduct within the meaning of that term as it was then defined by the statute.","start":755.336,"stop":783.866,"duration":28.53}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Kaufmann

decide whether to give retroactive effect to that new legislation, of course the Supreme Court of Alaska preferred not to give it retroactive effect when that argument was

all but one of the statements was false, I think that was just an oversight.","start":864.009,"stop":873.003,"duration":8.99},{"text":"We urge in an appendix to our reply brief, the green brief, that as a matter of fact these statements were not false, but some of them were mere expressions of opinion, that to some extent the Court had -- the school board simply misinterpreted the letter, but it’s our basic position that the principle of the New York Times -- of the New York Times case, that truth is not the test and the petitioner’s testified and it’s pages at 190 and 219 of the record and
