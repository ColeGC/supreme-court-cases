please.","start":9.543,"stop":11.679,"duration":2.14},{"text":"Petitioner is a Certified Public Accountant who was convicted in the court below of giving money to Internal Revenue Service agents.","start":11.679,"stop":21.513,"duration":9.83},{"text":"He was named in 24 counts of an indictment for 12 separate transactions with respect to each transaction there were two separate counts in the indictment.","start":21.513,"stop":34.019,"duration":12.51},{"text":"The Court of Appeals reversed three of the counts of the indictments so there were 21 counts remaining.","start":34.019,"stop":41.909,"duration":7.89},{"text":"The evidence very briefly consisted of testimony from seven Internal Revenue Service agents who testified generally that they received money from the petitioner in connection with their audit of various tax returns.","start":41.909,"stop":60.495,"duration":18.59},{"text":"The amount of money that they received varied from a low of $25.00 according to them to a high of $75.00 most of the payments were $50.00.","start":60.495,"stop":71.863,"duration":11.37},{"text":"With that very brief statement of the facts, because we’re not complaining that the evidence in the trial court was insufficient, I will go immediately to my first point which is that the evidence before the grand jury in this case was insufficient to support the indictment.","start":71.863,"stop":92.425,"duration":20.56},{"text":"Now the entire evidence before the grand jury in this case consisted according to the government’s characterization of an Internal Revenue Service agent’s brief summary of portions of affidavits relating to the alleged illegal payments made by petitioner.","start":92.425,"stop":117.329,"duration":24.9},{"text":"The man who testified before the grand jury, I don’t know who he was, but from the record in this case he could not have had any personal knowledge about more than just a few of these affidavits.","start":117.329,"stop":131.964,"duration":14.64},{"text":"In other words, the government puts a man before the grand jury who has no personal knowledge of most, if not all, of these pieces of paper that he’s summarizing, and then he briefly summarizes this hearsay, and that is the entire testimony to support this indictment.","start":131.964,"stop":155.455,"duration":23.49},{"text":"Now the grand jury testimony itself is not a part of the record.","start":155.455,"stop":159.599,"duration":4.14},{"text":"I know what it was because the government stated what it was in its brief in the Court of Appeals and the Solicitor General agrees that this is what the grand jury testimony was.","start":159.599,"stop":172.038,"duration":12.44},{"text":"Now, I am arguing here that that evidence was insufficient on alternative grounds, either under petitioner’s Fifth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury, I think that right includes some kind of substance behind the grand jury indictment, or if this case does not reach constitutional dimensions then I would ask this Court under its rule making power to so hold.","start":172.038,"stop":201.195,"duration":29.16},{"text":"Now it seems to me that I have two hurdles to overcome in this Court.","start":201.195,"stop":206.936,"duration":5.74},{"text":"First, I must convince the Court that there should be some kind of a standard of evidence in these grand jury situations, a standard of evidence which is enforceable by this Court and by other courts.","start":206.936,"stop":221.656,"duration":14.72},{"text":"Second, once I get beyond that hurdle, the question becomes what should that standard of evidence be.","start":221.656,"stop":229.367,"duration":7.71},{"text":"Addressing myself to the first question, I think that the analysis can be made in this way.","start":229.367,"stop":238.618,"duration":9.25},{"text":"Surely, I would think that everyone would agree that if an indictment is based upon no evidence, if for an example the prosecutor walks into the grand jury and says “Ladies and gentlemen, John Doe committed a crime, return an indictment.”","start":238.618,"stop":254.905,"duration":16.29},{"text":"And it does inconceivably it could.","start":254.905,"stop":257.94,"duration":3.03},{"text":"I think that all would agree that such an indictment would not be supported by this or any other court.","start":257.94,"stop":266.287,"duration":8.35}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Well you don’t -- you may be right, but there’s no case holding that is there?","start":266.287,"stop":273.844,"duration":7.56}]},{"speakerName":"Edward Brodsky","textObjs":[{"text":"No, not at all.","start":273.844,"stop":274.891,"duration":1.05},{"text":"I’m just trying to make an analysis now.","start":274.891,"stop":276.761,"duration":1.87}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"But I thought, alright just at the analytical level.","start":276.761,"stop":279.975,"duration":3.21}]},{"speakerName":"Edward Brodsky","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes.","start":279.975,"stop":280.872,"duration":0.9}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"That the cases have held that that is a matter entirely for the grand jury as to on what bases they’re going to bring in on that.","start":280.872,"stop":290.709,"duration":9.84}]},{"speakerName":"Edward Brodsky","textObjs":[{"text":"I think the Costello case in this Court certainly says that.","start":290.709,"stop":294.032,"duration":3.32},{"text":"There is no question about that.","start":294.032,"stop":295.824,"duration":1.79}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"But there are some decisions by various Courts of Appeals that would sustain what you have just said.","start":295.824,"stop":303.055,"duration":7.23}]},{"speakerName":"Edward

Costello.","start":304.25,"stop":305.019,"duration":0.77}]},{"speakerName":"Edward Brodsky","textObjs":[{"text":"There’s no decision after Costello which would sustain what I said.","start":305.019,"stop":309.688,"duration":4.67},{"text":"And I think to be perfectly frank that what I’m asking this Court to do is not to overrule Costello because I think this case is far distinguishable from Costello, but at least to change some of the broad sweeping language in Costello.","start":309.688,"stop":326.29,"duration":16.6},{"text":"Costello says that if an indictment is valid on its face, and if it was returned by a legally constituted grand jury that’s enough.","start":326.29,"stop":336.02,"duration":9.73},{"text":"And I’m saying that that is not enough under many circumstances and particularly under the circumstances of this case.","start":336.02,"stop":344.724,"duration":8.7},{"text":"And I think that what’s happened since Costello, I cite a number of cases in my brief where this has happened, is that prosecutors had been reading Costello in its broadest sense and have been returning indictments based upon less and less evidence.","start":344.724,"stop":365.839,"duration":21.12},{"text":"And I think that, and I charge in my brief, that one of the reasons that they’re doing this is because when they don’t put a person with personal knowledge before the grand jury then they don’t create another record by a person who is going to testify a trial, a record which would have to be turned over to defense counsel.","start":365.839,"stop":387.097,"duration":21.26},{"text":"So that prosecutors are motivated to get further and further away from presenting to grand juries any evidence which is based upon personal knowledge.","start":387.097,"stop":398.586,"duration":11.49},{"text":"And the further away from that which you get, the closer you get to a situation of no evidence at all, and I think --","start":398.586,"stop":406.607,"duration":8.02}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"But some of these people, whose affidavits were rather summarized to the grand jury testified here at trial, did they not?","start":406.607,"stop":415.597,"duration":8.99}]},{"speakerName":"Edward Brodsky","textObjs":[{"text":"All of them did Your Honor.","start":415.597,"stop":416.34,"duration":0.74}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"All of them?","start":416.34,"stop":417.158,"duration":0.82}]},{"speakerName":"Edward

not?","start":417.46,"stop":420.304,"duration":2.84}]},{"speakerName":"Edward Brodsky","textObjs":[{"text":"We obtained portions of their affidavits and the Solicitor General says and I have no reason to dispute it that the affidavits which they gave us at trial are the very same affidavits which were summarized before the grand jury, yes Your Honor.","start":420.304,"stop":434.47,"duration":14.17}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"So that in that sense and to that extent you could obtain something that is substitute for the testimony of these persons before the grand jury.","start":434.47,"stop":447.488,"duration":13.02}]},{"speakerName":"Edward Brodsky","textObjs":[{"text":"We did indeed.","start":447.488,"stop":448.22,"duration":0.73},{"text":"We would’ve obtained that Your Honor under the Jencks Act in any event.","start":448.22,"stop":451.941,"duration":3.72},{"text":"I think what the government avoids here if they would’ve had these same witnesses testify before this grand jury, we would’ve had not only their Jencks Act statements, these affidavits that were summarized, but in addition their grand jury testimony which might have been inconsistent with their Jencks Act statements.","start":451.941,"stop":472.159,"duration":20.22},{"text":"I’d like to pursue that for a minute.","start":472.159,"stop":473.954,"duration":1.8}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Was there any reason to think that these affidavits were not prepared specifically for the grand jury?","start":473.954,"stop":480.9,"duration":6.95}]},{"speakerName":"Edward Brodsky","textObjs":[{"text":"I have no evidence one way or the other on that.","start":480.9,"stop":482.643,"duration":1.74}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"So it is possible that the affidavits might not have existed if these persons have testified personally before the grand jury?","start":482.643,"stop":494.656,"duration":12.01}]},{"speakerName":"Edward Brodsky","textObjs":[{"text":"I doubt that for this reason.","start":494.656,"stop":497.74,"duration":3.08},{"text":"These very same persons testified before a previous grand jury in this case and six out of seven of them, when they were asked in substance to name the persons from whom they received money, failed to mention petitioner’s name.","start":497.74,"stop":516.881,"duration":19.14},{"text":"They did, when the prosecutor said “Are there other people from whom you have taken money whose names you don’t remember?”","start":516.881,"stop":522.759,"duration":5.88},{"text":"They said “Yes.”","start":522.759,"stop":523.653,"duration":0.89},{"text":"But when they were asked this specific question “Tell me the names of those persons from whom you received money,” six out of seven failed to mention petitioner’s name.","start":523.653,"stop":535.267,"duration":11.61},{"text":"Now when they come to get an indictment against petitioner, instead of using the same grand jury which knew about these prior, what I would call inconsistent statements, they go to a new grand jury and they don’t tell the new grand jury that these people have previously testified and failed to mention petitioner’s name.","start":535.267,"stop":556.237,"duration":20.97},{"text":"They merely have an agent who is isolated, from firsthand testimony, summarize these affidavits.","start":556.237,"stop":564.01,"duration":7.77},{"text":"And I think that’s very far away from any kind of substantive evidence.","start":564.01,"stop":570.146,"duration":6.14},{"text":"I should say also that the scope of this problem is indicated by a letter which is annexed to the government’s brief, a letter from the United States attorney for the southern district of New York to the Solicitor General, where the United States attorney says, in answer to my charge that in most cases, indictments are being returned on less and less evidence, he says himself that his policy has been up until this very case in the, and this is his language, in the so called cut and dried cases to have an agent summarize his interviews or his investigations of the case, mostly his interviews in the cases the way the United States attorney puts it.","start":570.146,"stop":617.997,"duration":47.85},{"text":"So that we have a situation where the United States attorneys throughout the country, unless the law is changed, unless this Court says something about it to make a change, the United States attorneys in this country have the discretion now to present second or third or fifth
