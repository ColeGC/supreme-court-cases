companies.","start":263.186,"stop":270.199,"duration":7.01},{"text":"And he in turn reports directly to the Vice President for Management of NEES, and NEES is understandable in this kind of a

systems.","start":278.935,"stop":286.057,"duration":7.12},{"text":"And to support their claim that divestiture of the gas properties have result in the loss of substantial economies, NEES relied on a very elaborate study which purported to show in great detail, exactly how much more it would cost for every phase of the gas company’s operations if they were required to operate separately rather than jointly.","start":286.057,"stop":311.347,"duration":25.29},{"text":"The study was prepared by a public utility consultant firm named Ebasco.","start":311.347,"stop":316.495,"duration":5.15},{"text":"The study basically what Ebasco did in making the study is as follows.","start":316.495,"stop":322.152,"duration":5.66},{"text":"First, they examined the gas system and attended to decide how it should appropriately be organized if each of the gas companies separately was divested from the electric system and you have eight separate gas companies operating.","start":322.152,"stop":338.078,"duration":15.93},{"text":"They’re decided on the appropriate organization and then they attempted to say how many employees each of the gas companies would require for this operation.","start":338.078,"stop":348.445,"duration":10.37},{"text":"Then they made a determination as to how much it would cost to run each of the gas properties separately.","start":348.445,"stop":354.001,"duration":5.56},{"text":"That is if they discovered, they would need three clerks in the billing office, they would attempt to say precisely how much the clerk would have to be paid.","start":354.001,"stop":361.547,"duration":7.55},{"text":"So it reached a composite figure, showing the total cost of operating all of the gas properties separately.","start":361.547,"stop":369.477,"duration":7.93},{"text":"Then they determined how much more this would be than the present cost of operating the gas property separately by looking to the -- primarily to the allocation on the books of the NEES system as between the gas and the electric companies.","start":369.477,"stop":385.556,"duration":16.08},{"text":"When services were performed and expenses were incurred by the NEES system, it allocated part to gas and part to electric.","start":385.556,"stop":393.424,"duration":7.87},{"text":"They accepted in most instances these allocations, compare them and reached the figure showing the additional expenses, then and the only event that they make a further study building on this information to determine how much less the expenses would be if instead of the eight gas companies being operated as eight separate systems, they are operated as a single system.","start":393.424,"stop":416.572,"duration":23.15},{"text":"And the end result of this lengthy analysis, this lengthy study which occupies three volumes is they concluded that upon divestiture of the gas properties as a single system, additional expenses of approximately one million and one hundred dollars would be incurred.","start":416.572,"stop":434.134,"duration":17.56},{"text":"The Commission held two things.","start":434.134,"stop":436.037,"duration":1.9},{"text":"The Commission held first that because of various deficiencies and defects in this study, it didn’t provide a reliable basis for establishing that there would be a loss of substantial economies and secondly it held that even if you accepted the figure projected by Ebasco that in the statutory sense would not constitute economies that would be substantial.","start":436.037,"stop":459.609,"duration":23.57},{"text":"Now, I think it’s

this in this particular function $109.00 less.","start":472.207,"stop":482.778,"duration":10.57},{"text":"But basically, what this study is, is a series of a huge number of business judgments.","start":482.778,"stop":489.344,"duration":6.57},{"text":"If you want to call on that, perhaps you might say informed guesses and they just do not have, it seems to the Commission, the kind

study.","start":685.847,"stop":695.156,"duration":9.31},{"text":"But I like to come to the point that I alluded a moment ago in answer to Justice White’s question that the basic flow here is that there was no attempt really on the part of the defendants to tie this particular claim of increased expenses to the ability of the gas system to operate efficiently on its own.","start":695.156,"stop":716.374,"duration":21.22},{"text":"And not only was there no attempt to show that by this study but in fact the record shows and the Commission found that independent companies not under control with electric systems were able to operate successfully.","start":716.374,"stop":733.108,"duration":16.73},{"text":"Now, there are two aspects of this which I would like to discuss.","start":733.108,"stop":736.892,"duration":3.78},{"text":"The first thing deals with seven independent gas companies in Massachusetts.","start":736.892,"stop":743.5,"duration":6.61},{"text":"All of which was smaller than NEES and I say independent in the sense that these companies were not under common control with an electric company that was serving the same area.","start":743.5,"stop":757.837,"duration":14.34},{"text":"Now, this seems to us the relevant standard because the respondents have estimated that 80% of the additional expenses resulting from the divestiture were due to the separation of the joint -- the elimination of the joint operations of the electric and the gas system.","start":757.837,"stop":778.321,"duration":20.48},{"text":"And it seems to us highly relevant that if other gas companies in the same area have been operating successfully without the benefits, the alleged benefits I may say of being part of an electric holding company system, this it seems to us pretty clearly indicates that the NEES system, larger than these other systems should never have no trouble doing the same thing.","start":778.321,"stop":806.937,"duration":28.62},{"text":"And as the Commission put it at page 815 of the Appendix that’s this little brown volume as distinguished in the large record and the previous case.","start":806.937,"stop":816.53,"duration":9.59},{"text":"They said they couldn’t accept this contention that NEES, the second largest gas system in Massachusetts would not be able to provide management and service comparable to that provided by other gas utilities in the state.","start":816.53,"stop":830.769,"duration":14.24},{"text":"Now, the Commission also pointed out that the percentage ratios in this case, that is the ratio between the amount of alleged additional expenses in various operating figures deemed significant revenues, revenue deductions, gross and net income were either less in this case -- were less in this case or either less or not significantly higher than comparable percentages that in a number of previous cases in which divestiture had been ordered, the Commission held was not substantial in the statutory sense and they’ve set that out in a table at page 28 of the Appendix attached to the opinion.","start":830.769,"stop":871.653,"duration":40.88},{"text":"And again, it seems to us by the same kind of reasoning if the losses involved on the divestiture of other systems were not significantly greater than this system that too undermines the claim that the increases here would seriously impair the ability of the gas system to operate.","start":871.653,"stop":894.191,"duration":22.54},{"text":"Now, it seems to us that its -- this whole thing is not at all surprising because as we have set out in our brief, the legislative history of the Act, the original Federal Trade Commission Report upon which it was based.","start":894.191,"stop":911.149,"duration":16.96},{"text":"The debates in Congress indicate that the Congress generally expected and anticipated that it would only be the small system that would be able to demonstrate that its separation from the holding company system would seriously impair its operating abilities.","start":911.149,"stop":930.092,"duration":18.94},{"text":"The Congress was aware during the debates on the Public Utility Holding Company Act of the claims by the proponents of holding companies that they produce great benefits for the operating companies and that they were also aware naturally of the claim that terminating the holding company relationship between gas and electric properties would result in additional expenses.","start":930.092,"stop":953.904,"duration":23.81},{"text":"But Congress in that statute made the value of judgment that any alleged benefits of the holding company were outweighed by the benefits to the public of breaking up these systems and eliminating the great evils that they have been shown to have and as the conference committee report on the Bill putted, the congress decide that it should be limited to a single system unless the holding company can show a real economic need on the part of the additional integrated system to be in the Holding Company Act.","start":953.904,"stop":987.827,"duration":33.92},{"text":"Now, there is another aspect of the Commission’s decision.","start":987.827,"stop":993.625,"duration":5.8},{"text":"The is the Commission in evaluating the claim that these additional expenses would result in the loss of substantial economies took account of the fact that there are off setting compensating benefits which in your two-way gas system when it is separated from an electric system in the same holding company and when this case was here before this Court recognized this significance of this fact.","start":993.625,"stop":1025.123,"duration":31.5},{"text":"The Court had pointed out -- the Court pointed out that one of the evils that have resulted from control of utilities by holding companies was the retention in one system of both gas and electric properties and the favoring of one of these competing forms of energy over the other.","start":1025.123,"stop":1040.877,"duration":15.75},{"text":"The Court also recognized that the competitive advantages to be gained by a separation of gas and electric are difficult to forecast and it concluded that the evaluation of such benefits is a matter of Commission expertise on the total competitive situation.","start":1040.877,"stop":1059.472,"duration":18.6},{"text":"Now, I think these statements by the Court have to be considered in the light of the argument.","start":1059.472,"stop":1065.046,"duration":5.57},{"text":"The Commission argued the last time that the case was here that one reason for giving the statute the broad reading was because otherwise if you just had assessed a substantial business judgment, the economies that was substantial in that sense there was no room for the Commission to take into account these offsetting benefits.","start":1065.046,"stop":1084.349,"duration":19.3},{"text":"But when the case came back to the Court of Appeals, the Court suggested that all that could be done on the matter of off setting benefits was to consider them in interpreting the statute but once you have interpreted the statute, the Commission could not take account of these offsetting benefits unless it was actually able to put a dollar and cents value on them.","start":1084.349,"stop":1106.445,"duration":22.1},{"text":"In other words, I’ll tell you what the Court of Appeals are saying, the only way the Commission in determining whether a loss of substantial economies have been shown, the only way the Commission in deciding that question could take account of offsetting benefits was to put a value on it that the offsetting benefits of competition amount to $200,000.00, a $100,000.00 whatever the figure would be.","start":1106.445,"stop":1128.122,"duration":21.68},{"text":"And I particularly invite the Court’s attention to page 45 of the joint appendix.","start":1128.122,"stop":1133.81,"duration":5.69},{"text":"That was the first opinion which the Court of Appeals in its second opinion said it was readopting and say, it’s at the top of page 45, what we do question is the Commission’s failure to find or articulate any specific or approximate financial benefit that such a change would occasion.","start":1133.81,"stop":1153.255,"duration":19.45},{"text":"This is in connection with its discussion of the offsetting benefits of competition.","start":1153.255,"stop":1158.24,"duration":4.98},{"text":"Now, that seems to us robs the standard of any meaning because I don’t see how you can take a fact into account in determining what the statute means and then say you completely exclude it when you come to apply it and it seems to us, if this is a significant factor in interpreting the statute, it can only be given significance when you come to apply the statute.","start":1158.24,"stop":1180.089,"duration":21.85},{"text":"Now, I would like to come briefly to some of the criticisms that the Court of Appeals made of the Commission’s treatment of this case.","start":1180.089,"stop":1192,"duration":11.91},{"text":"We have said out in our brief and at greater length in our reply brief, a number of the defects that the Commission found in this study which in its view rendered it unreliable as a basis for predicting what the loss of economies would be and that is if I change it, what the additional expenses would be.","start":1192,"stop":1213.467,"duration":21.47},{"text":"I walk -- them at the oral argument that some of them are quite detailed and quite complicated but I would like to explain that basically they’re related to a category of expenses known as treasury and customer accounting.","start":1213.467,"stop":1227.234,"duration":13.77},{"text":"And this represented roughly 40% of the total additional expenses that Ebasco predicted would flow from the separation of the properties.","start":1227.234,"stop":1239.16,"duration":11.93},{"text":"The Court of Appeals said that as I quote it, “We do not necessarily criticize the Commission for its skepticism in the specifics.”","start":1239.16,"stop":1251.797,"duration":12.64},{"text":"I take it, that meant, they didn’t criticize the Commission for finding that there were some defects in the study but what it said was, the Commission was required not to reject the study because of these defects but to adjust it downward to find out how much less than the amount allegedly established was shown by the study and then to make a determination whether that lesser amount was substantial.","start":1251.797,"stop":1276.866,"duration":25.07},{"text":"Now, the infirmities in this case were not just arithmetical errors, errors in the sense that perhaps they used the wrong figure for something.","start":1276.866,"stop":1286.753,"duration":9.89},{"text":"They are we think basic errors in the methodology of the study and we think that where the study itself is subject to this deficiencies that the Commission was acting well within its authority in saying it could not accept the study at all as a basis for predicting the amount of additional expenses.","start":1286.753,"stop":1307.029,"duration":20.28},{"text":"We don’t think the Commission was required to go through this study and after it had gone and found these defects then to go ahead and look at every single item and try to determine the value of the correctness of every particular additional little amount estimated.","start":1307.029,"stop":1322.632,"duration":15.6},{"text":"That will be as an impossible burden on the Commission.","start":1322.632,"stop":1328.756,"duration":6.12},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals in dealing with the second phase of the case, that is the Commission’s conclusion that even if you accepted for the sake of argument, the dollar expense estimate by the holding company that this would be not substantial, criticize the Commission on the ground that it had failed to address itself to what the impact of these additional expenses would be on the NEES gas properties.","start":1328.756,"stop":1357.36,"duration":28.6},{"text":"It said that they just invoke ratios of other companies and these are irrelevant.","start":1357.36,"stop":1361.858,"duration":4.5},{"text":"Well, in the first place, we think the burden basically was on the respondents to prove that the effect of these additional expenses would be substantially to impair the ability of the NEES system.","start":1361.858,"stop":1376.813,"duration":14.96},{"text":"Furthermore, it seems as I have indicated that the effect of such increases in expenses on comparable companies, on companies which have shown their ability to operate without this “the crutch” of the holding company support is the clearest evidence that this particular company if it is turned lose from holding company control similarly would be able to stand alone and I think I -- that basically, the burden of proof is on the respondent and that the Commission here properly exercised this discretion and at full basis for concluding as it’s stated the end of its opinion at page 25 of the Appendix that it could not find on this record that the gas companies could not be soundly and economically operated independently of NEES and we think that the Court of Appeals when it told the Commission to take another look at this case that it had to
