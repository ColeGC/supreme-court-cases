Adams, the treasury's expert and adviser, appeared before Congress and recommended on behalf of the treasury, the statutory provision which is still in effect in essence allowing the deduction of the entire amount spent for meals and lodging while away from home in the pursuit of the trade or business.","start":469.724,"stop":502.594,"duration":32.87},{"text":"Curiously enough, the particular question was which we are concerned does not seem to have a reason for the next 20 years or more.","start":502.594,"stop":515.211,"duration":12.62},{"text":"I suppose that was because of high exemptions and relatively low rates which were involved at that time.","start":515.211,"stop":523.274,"duration":8.06},{"text":"However, it was very early established and there were decisions of the Tax Court in 1924.","start":523.274,"stop":532.667,"duration":9.39},{"text":"The first -- the very first volume of then it was the Board of Tax Appeals, and there had been administrative rulings as early as 1919 that the commuter could not deduct his meal expenses.","start":532.667,"stop":547.607,"duration":14.94},{"text":"And there where even some cases involving two-meal commuters, that is the businessman or the lawyer might come in and not only have lunch but he had to work in the evening.","start":547.607,"stop":560.241,"duration":12.63},{"text":"So he went out some place and had supper, and neither the lunch nor the supper was allowed as a deduction although I would point out that it could at least in some sense be regarded as coming within the literal language of the statute which allows the deduction of the entire amount expended for meals and lodging while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business.","start":560.241,"stop":586.484,"duration":26.24},{"text":"Now, this meant that very early, it was recognized that away from home, was an illusive verbal construct and required some rather careful consideration.","start":586.484,"stop":604.631,"duration":18.15},{"text":"As early as 1940, the treasury ruled in effect that no deduction could be had unless the taxpayer was required to be a way long enough to need a sleep or rest.","start":604.631,"stop":624.677,"duration":20.05},{"text":"From 1944 to 1962, there were more than a dozen cases which supported what is sometimes called the Commissioner's “overnight rule” where he tried to draw the line by saying that you can't deduct meals unless you are away overnight.","start":624.677,"stop":646.332,"duration":21.65},{"text":"I think a more refined version of it is to call it the sleep or rest rule because cases that soon arose where taxpayers didn't necessarily sleep at night.","start":646.332,"stop":660.145,"duration":13.81},{"text":"The railroad conductor who took a long trip and took a room for rest during the day returning on an evening run, the Commissioner in 1940s said that if he was required to take the room, that he could deduct not only the cost of the room but also the meals.","start":660.145,"stop":684.736,"duration":24.59},{"text":"And the First Circuit Court of Appeals for some years ago held that whether he was required or not, if the length of the trip was such as to make it appropriate for him to seek rest in the course of the journey, he could deduct not only the cost of the lodging but also the meals.","start":684.736,"stop":706.801,"duration":22.07},{"text":"Beginning in 1948, the Commissioner made this very specific in two places, actually beginning in 1946 which is 21 years ago.","start":706.801,"stop":719.41,"duration":12.61},{"text":"And for the convenience of the Court, I printed the text of this in the reply brief which has been filed in the Correll case on page 11 of the reply brief are set out the instructions, the official instructions which the Commissioner has used with respect to Form 1040, the standard taxpayer return form.","start":719.41,"stop":749.024,"duration":29.61},{"text":"And since 1948, these instructions have always specified as indicated that near at the top of page 11, the last sentence of the indented quotation traveling “away from home” means going away from the city or town where you normally work and remaining away at least overnight.","start":749.024,"stop":774.321,"duration":25.3},{"text":"And you'll find that phrase at least overnight in all the rest of the instructions right down through 1966.","start":774.321,"stop":784.592,"duration":10.27},{"text":"The 1967 instructions I believe have not yet appeared.","start":784.592,"stop":790.155,"duration":5.56},{"text":"In addition the Commissioner puts out a booklet called “Your Federal Income Tax,” and since 1946, as quoted at the bottom of the page 12, this booklet has specifically referred to require his absence overnight, at top of page 13 from which he does not return the same day.","start":790.155,"stop":820.029,"duration":29.87},{"text":"The 1955 edition is quoted at the bottom of page 13 in the last full line and remaining away at least overnight.","start":820.029,"stop":831.448,"duration":11.42},{"text":"You then find some modification beginning in the 59 and the 63 editions where there is a reference to necessitate relief from duty to obtain sleep or to obtain necessary sleep showing the transition to the sleep or rest rule which seems to me to be inappropriate and thoroughly sound than refinement of the originally stated overnight rule.","start":831.448,"stop":864.846,"duration":33.4},{"text":"In 1954, the Internal Revenue Code was given a comprehensive revision.","start":864.846,"stop":872.845,"duration":8},{"text":"And there was some reference to this problem in three situations.","start":872.845,"stop":880.072,"duration":7.23},{"text":"In the first place at the hearings, a taxpayer appeared objected to the overnight rule and set it out to be changed.","start":880.072,"stop":889.12,"duration":9.05},{"text":"No change was made.","start":889.12,"stop":890.911,"duration":1.79},{"text":"I don't put great significance in that.","start":890.911,"stop":893.343,"duration":2.43},{"text":"I simply record it as one of the facts.","start":893.343,"stop":899.806,"duration":6.46},{"text":"Two amendments were made to the statute in 1954.","start":899.806,"stop":905.637,"duration":5.83},{"text":"One was the enactment of a Section 120 which specifically allowed a state policeman to deduct an amount of $5.00 a day and in the provision which is sent then repealed by Congress because it was found impossible to justify this special deduction for state policemen when such a deduction was not available for others.","start":905.637,"stop":937.577,"duration":31.94},{"text":"But in the Committee Report with respect to that, Congress referred specifically to the fact that the application of the statute at that time allowed for the deduction for meals while away from home overnight.","start":937.577,"stop":958.461,"duration":20.88}]},{"speakerName":"Hugo L.

away from home overnight, the overnight is printed in italics in the brief and those are italics, the Committee Report is simply printed in ordinary type.","start":961.366,"stop":1000.426,"duration":39.06},{"text":"There was also another provision in 1954.","start":1000.426,"stop":1006.306,"duration":5.88},{"text":"This problem arises not only with respect to the deduction in Section 162, but in a somewhat mildly complicated way with respect to the determination of adjusted gross income which for practical purposes means whether you can get the deduction and also take the standard deduction of 10% of your income.","start":1006.306,"stop":1032.775,"duration":26.47},{"text":"And until 1954, because of the way the statute was worded, there was a difference wholly unjustified between the taxpayer who paid his own travel expenses and the taxpayer who was reimbursed by his employer with respect to the travel expenses.","start":1032.775,"stop":1052.844,"duration":20.07},{"text":"When Congress straightened that out in 1954 by an amendment to Section 622 (c) and again, the Committee Report expressly refers to the fact that the Commissioner's rule is away from home overnight.","start":1052.844,"stop":1073.998,"duration":21.15},{"text":"Now there was no official dissent from that view until 1962 when the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeal decided a case called Hanson.","start":1073.998,"stop":1091.067,"duration":17.07},{"text":"There was an earlier case in the First Circuit which uses a language to the effect that the Commissioner's construction of the statute is something that he dreamed up but actually the First Circuit case involved a railroad conductor who took a long trip to a distant place, took a room for sleep or rest, and came back.","start":1091.067,"stop":1115.292,"duration":24.22},{"text":"And as I've indicated the Commissioner has long since accepted that goes on the overnight rule.","start":1115.292,"stop":1122.814,"duration":7.52},{"text":"But it was the Hanson case in the Eighth Circuit which first threw uncertainty into that picture.","start":1122.814,"stop":1136.026,"duration":13.21},{"text":"I may mention just to complete the statutory history that in 1962, Section 162 was amended in a way which is not applicable here because the years involved here are 1960 and ‘61 but which is also clearly not relevant because what it did was simply to limit the deduction to amounts which are not leverage in amount and there's not suggestion that anything of that sort was involved.","start":1136.026,"stop":1167.997,"duration":31.97},{"text":"Finally in 1963, the treasury recommended to Congress that the statute be changed.","start":1167.997,"stop":1177.171,"duration":9.17},{"text":"This is referred to on pages 25 and 26 of the government's brief.","start":1177.171,"stop":1184.602,"duration":7.43},{"text":"The treasury suggested that the deduction be allowed where there was an absence of 16 hours or more and where substantial arrest was needed in connection with the travel.","start":1184.602,"stop":1198.474,"duration":13.87},{"text":"It also suggested that there be a duty area which would be a circle of 20 miles radius.","start":1198.474,"stop":1208.644,"duration":10.17},{"text":"Nothing came of this recommendation.","start":1208.644,"stop":1210.975,"duration":2.33},{"text":"It was not reported out of the Committee on Ways and Means.","start":1210.975,"stop":1216.819,"duration":5.84},{"text":"And I mentioned that simply to complete the story.","start":1216.819,"stop":1226.043,"duration":9.22},{"text":"Now, one can look at this statutory language and try to search out the “meaning of Congress.”","start":1226.043,"stop":1241.429,"duration":15.39},{"text":"And I would suggest that that is a rather illusory matter because I find it difficult to find any evidence that Congress ever thought about this detailed application of the statutory provision.","start":1241.429,"stop":1258.963,"duration":17.53},{"text":"I would like to suggest to the Court that this is essentially a case of tax administration.","start":1258.963,"stop":1265.204,"duration":6.24},{"text":"That Congress has committed the administration of this statute to the treasury has authorized the Commissioner to make appropriate rules and regulations and the Commissioner has made such rules and regulations.","start":1265.204,"stop":1285.275,"duration":20.07},{"text":"They might may or may not be the same as a Court would make as an original proposition.","start":1285.275,"stop":1294.012,"duration":8.74},{"text":"But my thought would be that unless the Court finds that this is an unreasonable or wholly inappropriate construction and application of the statute, it should be upheld.","start":1294.012,"stop":1308.434,"duration":14.42},{"text":"There are two problems, or there is a problem arising from the application of these two statutory provisions.","start":1308.434,"stop":1320.19,"duration":11.76},{"text":"I repeat, if there was Section 162 alone, I wouldn't doubt that these meal expenses would be deductible.","start":1320.19,"stop":1329.694,"duration":9.5},{"text":"If there was Section 262 alone, no deduction allowed for personal family and living expenses seems to me equally declare that the meal expenses would not be deductible.","start":1329.694,"stop":1341.065,"duration":11.37},{"text":"What you actually have then is the two statutory provisions; both obviously intended to be given some effect by Congress.","start":1341.065,"stop":1350.973,"duration":9.91},{"text":"And the problem is to work out a practical administrable way to give appropriate application to these provisions and I suggest to at the same time, to provide a measure of equality of treatment between taxpayers who are similarly situated.","start":1350.973,"stop":1375.269,"duration":24.3}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"I suppose if we had only Section 162 alone, somebody who commuted to Wall Street say
