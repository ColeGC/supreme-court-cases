brought by a jailer in the town of Greenville, Texas where he was being held for a trial.","start":42.869,"stop":52.355,"duration":9.49},{"text":"At the time of his trial as his trial proceeded, his court appointed counsel in Greenville filed a motion to quash the indictment which alleged four prior convictions which the state used to invoke one of the habitual criminal statutes, the result of which would be life imprisonment.","start":52.355,"stop":75.043,"duration":22.69},{"text":"There was no state procedure available before trial to attack the prior convictions.","start":75.043,"stop":82.015,"duration":6.97},{"text":"The motion to quash as set out in the statutes applied only to technical features of the indictment such as an illegally constituted grand jury.","start":82.015,"stop":93.427,"duration":11.41},{"text":"Nevertheless, the court appointed lawyer moved to quash, stating that he didn't have enough information to make any further attack.","start":93.427,"stop":105.777,"duration":12.35},{"text":"There was no action taken insofar as the record is concerned on his motion to quash but the counsel really couldn't expect the Court to take any motion since the Texas law was clear that the defendant was not entitled to have copies of the prior convictions that were going to be used against him and that the defendant was not entitled to object prior to trial to the use of any prior conviction, instead he had to make his objection in front of the jury.","start":105.777,"stop":135.494,"duration":29.72},{"text":"As the trial began, the state read the indictment and the jury was told that petitioner was duly and legally convicted on four prior occasions.","start":135.494,"stop":146.845,"duration":11.35},{"text":"As the evidence came in, the state introduced into evidence one version, first of one of the Tennessee convictions alleged.","start":146.845,"stop":158.262,"duration":11.42},{"text":"That conviction stated

counsel.","start":174.189,"stop":186.587,"duration":12.4},{"text":"His court appointed lawyer objected on the ground that the conviction showed on its face that petitioner did not have counsel and that there was no indication of waiver which brought him squarely within Carnley against Cochran.","start":186.587,"stop":201.198,"duration":14.61},{"text":"Secondly, he raised the issue of course under the Fourteenth Amendment.","start":201.198,"stop":207.082,"duration":5.88},{"text":"The judge reserved ruling and the state offered the same conviction and evidence, this time, a different and inconsistent certified copy of the same conviction.","start":207.082,"stop":218.149,"duration":11.07},{"text":"The second version did not have a recitation that counsel was not present.","start":218.149,"stop":223.393,"duration":5.24},{"text":"It was simply silent on whether counsel was present.","start":223.393,"stop":226.808,"duration":3.41},{"text":"Again, there was no language in the second certified copy of the same conviction to indicate that petitioner had been tendered counsel or that he had waived counsel.","start":226.808,"stop":237.485,"duration":10.68},{"text":"The Court then proceeded to receive evidence again without making a ruling and again over counsel's objections, proceeded to hear evidence concerning a Texas conviction for burglary, the preceding in 1964.","start":237.485,"stop":254.146,"duration":16.66},{"text":"The judge after a hearing, partially in camara, ruled out the Texas conviction on the ground that it was void on state law grounds.","start":254.146,"stop":263.645,"duration":9.5},{"text":"He did not admit the first version of the Tennessee conviction that

stating -- overruling defendant's objections, the trial proceeding.","start":270.117,"stop":283.018,"duration":12.9},{"text":"There was nothing else in the record to indicate what happened until the Court's charge in which the Court charged the jury that they had heard certain evidence that tended to show that the defendant had been guilty of previous crimes and that they were not to consider that for any purpose.","start":283.018,"stop":300.644,"duration":17.63}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"How about the other two Tennessee convictions that were alleged in the

Tennessee convictions with the language that he'd be rendered infamous and incapable of giving testimony (Inaudible) language of that

alleged prior convictions.","start":411.967,"stop":419.625,"duration":7.66},{"text":"Now, only two are required under the Texas Act but I decided to use four prior convictions which I am permitted to do by the Court of Criminal Appeals.","start":419.625,"stop":431.513,"duration":11.89},{"text":"I look at this convictions and I see that at least one Tennessee conviction that I'm going to offer in

conviction.","start":442.697,"stop":450.363,"duration":7.67},{"text":"But this I can see that on the certified copy of the conviction that I'm going to offer in evidence it affirmatively states that petitioner was without counsel.","start":450.363,"stop":461.536,"duration":11.17},{"text":"And also, there is nothing in any of the convictions or any of the papers certified under Civil Secretary of
