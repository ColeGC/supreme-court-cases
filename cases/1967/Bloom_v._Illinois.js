Mr. Justice Fortas as I recall took the position that where or rather they equate and I should say, a criminal contempt to a petty crime and then taking the petty crime which is defined under the appropriate United States statute, I believe it's 18 U.S.C 1.","start":660.789,"stop":695.569,"duration":34.78},{"text":"I found there that the maximum penalty to constitute a petty crime was six

which did not exceed six months.","start":695.569,"stop":721.16,"duration":25.59},{"text":"But nevertheless, a caveat was published to the lower courts which in the language of this Court seem to

not a constitutional finding by this Court and was merely an exercise of the supervisory powers of the Court.","start":750.927,"stop":767.587,"duration":16.66},{"text":"I of course contend the opposite and I say that it would have been impossible for this Court no matter what it called it to have decided the question presented in Cheff without as a matter of logic deciding when the issue of this caveat that any punishment more than six months was unconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment and Article III.","start":767.587,"stop":792.153,"duration":24.57},{"text":"We have briefed this fully as has the state.","start":792.153,"stop":795.654,"duration":3.5},{"text":"Now then, it seems also to me as a matter of reasoning that there is just no reason whatsoever why a criminal contempt should ever be considered in any manner different from the ordinary crime or criminal prosecution.","start":795.654,"stop":819.76,"duration":24.11},{"text":"For instance, in the past, this Court as well as the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois had held that a -- an alleged contemnor is entitled to any number of rights all of which are granted to him only in the event of the commission of a crime.","start":819.76,"stop":839.163,"duration":19.4},{"text":"For instance, under decisions here and under decisions of the State of Illinois an alleged contemnor is entitled to the presumption of innocence.","start":839.163,"stop":848.484,"duration":9.32},{"text":"He is entitled to the application of the rule that he must be proved guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, self incrimination is not permitted.","start":848.484,"stop":860.389,"duration":11.9},{"text":"He has a right to counsel, he has an opportunity to prepare for trial, he must be given notices of the charges against him, he has a right to an impartial arbiter of the facts, he has the benefit of statutes of limitations covering crimes and finally under these decisions, he has the right to petition for pardon.","start":860.389,"stop":884.491,"duration":24.1},{"text":"It seems to me that there is just no logic to support the theory that a criminal prosecution at any way differs from a crime and more importantly because I do not wish to overstate my own case, more importantly where the conduct charge actually does as it is here does constitute a crime.","start":884.491,"stop":912.477,"duration":27.99},{"text":"Now, there is another reason which seems to me logically to support our position and that is by an analysis which I will make very briefly of why a court has a contempt power at all.","start":912.477,"stop":927.922,"duration":15.45},{"text":"And there are decisions after decisions saying that courts have this power in order to protect themselves.","start":927.922,"stop":936.487,"duration":8.56},{"text":"That is to protect themselves from insult and contumacy committed in their presence or to enforce their judgments and so on.","start":936.487,"stop":945.705,"duration":9.22},{"text":"But at the same time, the decisions of this Court and particularly the early decisions that indicate that the power of contempt as they said should be the least power adequate to the end proposed.","start":945.705,"stop":961.107,"duration":15.4},{"text":"I believe that was in a very early decision of this Court to this case, the Bessette case.","start":961.107,"stop":965.31,"duration":4.2},{"text":"And so, I point out to the Court that the power -- the contempt power should be used sparingly and in my humble opinion only where it is necessary and under the fact situation as it is in the case at bar, the exercise of the contempt power is not necessary at all.","start":965.31,"stop":986.374,"duration":21.06},{"text":"That is by a court.","start":986.374,"stop":988.109,"duration":1.74},{"text":"Since the Court is given adequate protection by the state's attorney of Cook County in this particular instance who may proceed upon the criminal conduct and bring the man to trial which as I have said before would entitle him to a
