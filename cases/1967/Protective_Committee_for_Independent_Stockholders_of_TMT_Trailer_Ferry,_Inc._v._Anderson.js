that their appointment by the Court would be compatible with the interest of the data and consistent with public policy.","start":366.334,"stop":397.566,"duration":31.23},{"text":"We think this is a

Simmons, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes sir.","start":547.916,"stop":549.274,"duration":1.36},{"text":"The trustee is a retired successful merchant.","start":549.274,"stop":556.185,"duration":6.91},{"text":"For many years, he was a manager of a large retail department store and a successful reputable businessman in Miami.","start":556.185,"stop":566.83,"duration":10.65},{"text":"He'd lived in Miami for many years.","start":566.83,"stop":568.524,"duration":1.69},{"text":"He'd been associated with large department stores.","start":568.524,"stop":570.784,"duration":2.26},{"text":"This is well-known in the community.","start":570.784,"stop":573.011,"duration":2.23},{"text":"He'd retired and the Court appointed him as trustee.","start":573.011,"stop":577.311,"duration":4.3},{"text":"He'd had no interest or knowledge of TMT at all before that.","start":577.311,"stop":581.876,"duration":4.56},{"text":"He'd been in the -- he's just a good businessman and he brought to the trusteeship with him the man that had been his general manager and right-hand man in the retail merchandizing business, Mr. (Inaudible), who brought a great deal of know-how and sound business methods to this trusteeship.","start":581.876,"stop":604.423,"duration":22.55},{"text":"It would appear that opposing counsel would write into the Bankruptcy Act something that Congress has not written into it.","start":604.423,"stop":616.625,"duration":12.2},{"text":"And I think it was admitted yesterday that in 1948 or 1958, the SEC sponsored enacting Congress that would have expressly prohibited the employment of a trustee for a period of two years after the conclusion of reorganization proceedings and it would appear that the SEC knows that Congress has not yet prohibited the employment of the trustee.","start":616.625,"stop":646.408,"duration":29.78},{"text":"So we say that the Fifth Circuit placed a proper construction on the statutes involved here when it held that the proponents of the plan that that -- what the -- the dis -- the appellate court held that the trustee is not disinterested unless the proponents of the plan assured him of emoluments and security rather than merely nominating him for approval by the Court and subject to the usual control of the board of directors.","start":646.408,"stop":679.322,"duration":32.91},{"text":"Now, one of the most imp -- significant factors in this whole issue is that, no attempt has been made to disqualify this trustee because of his interest in employment by the reorganized company or for any other reason.","start":679.322,"stop":700.487,"duration":21.16},{"text":"If the position of opposing counsel is correct, this trustee has been disqualified since early 1959 for that was the first time when a plan of reorganization was proposed that contemplated his employment.","start":700.487,"stop":721.213,"duration":20.73},{"text":"Every plan has contemplated his employment since early 1959.","start":721.213,"stop":728.984,"duration":7.77},{"text":"So we say to the Court that it is too late now to urge that his past disqualification prohibits him from being employed in the future.","start":728.984,"stop":744.126,"duration":15.14},{"text":"The plan has been substantially consummated.","start":744.126,"stop":748.564,"duration":4.44},{"text":"New directors have taken over the operations of the business and are running the company with this trustee in his team in charge of operations.","start":748.564,"stop":758.759,"duration":10.2},{"text":"It would be highly inequitable to re -- now require the reorganized company to fire him and force him -- enforce it to employ a less qualified person to run the business.","start":758.759,"stop":774.513,"duration":15.75},{"text":"We say that the petitioner and the Securities and Exchange Commission are now estopped to raise this question after having permitted the trustee for eight years to operate the business of this data, knowing all that time that he was being considered for employment by the reorganized company without coming in and specifically asking the Court to remove him for that reason.","start":774.513,"stop":806.597,"duration":32.08},{"text":"Another point that I want to emphasize is, that this issue was decided by the Fifth Circuit in its 1964 decision when this plan of reorganization was first reviewed by that Court.","start":806.597,"stop":824.512,"duration":17.91},{"text":"You recall it has been reviewed twice and we're here after the second review.","start":824.512,"stop":833.058,"duration":8.55},{"text":"The very provisions of the plan that are here now were before the Fifth Circuit in 1964 and the Fifth Circuit upheld those provisions in the plan with respect to the employment of the trustee.","start":833.058,"stop":848.183,"duration":15.13},{"text":"Therefore, that decision became the law of the case for no appeal was taken from it.","start":848.183,"stop":857.622,"duration":9.44},{"text":"And we say that this Court should now recognize under the circumstances of this case, the law of the case on the question of the trustee's employment as it was decided by the Fifth Circuit in 1964.","start":857.622,"stop":874.179,"duration":16.56},{"text":"When the Fifth Circuit sent the plan back in 1964, it sent it back only to determine its feasibility in the light of the companion decision which it made in another case requiring payment in full of the Government nontax claims.","start":874.179,"stop":896.867,"duration":22.69},{"text":"These claims amounted to $900,000 so there was a question as to whether the data would be able to do it.","start":896.867,"stop":903.188,"duration":6.32},{"text":"But by means of this bank loan that I referred to a while ago, the $1,250,000 borrowed in that amount of money, the data was able to pay the Government nontax claims in full as well, as I have said, all other preferred and secured claims.","start":903.188,"stop":920.028,"duration":16.84},{"text":"So the plan of reorganization that we now have before us, the amended plan is amended only in one particular, one material particular: that is to provide for the payment of the nontax claims of the Government in full.","start":920.028,"stop":935.153,"duration":15.13},{"text":"It was not amended in any particular with respect to the employment of the trustee.","start":935.153,"stop":941.212,"duration":6.06},{"text":"And the amended plan that we have here now approves the appointment of the same officers and directors of the reorganized company as the first plan did back in 1964 when it first went to the appellate court.","start":941.212,"stop":961.609,"duration":20.4},{"text":"Now the Court well knows that the law of the case is a salutary one designed to end litigation.","start":961.609,"stop":969.339,"duration":7.73},{"text":"And under the decisions of this and other courts, it should be recognized and followed, unless there are impelling reasons for reversing the former decision.","start":969.339,"stop":981.703,"duration":12.36},{"text":"On the contrary in this case, there are impelling reasons for allowing it to stand.","start":981.703,"stop":988.373,"duration":6.67},{"text":"Number one, there's been no effort to remove the trustee, as I have pointed out.","start":988.373,"stop":994.449,"duration":6.08},{"text":"Number two, the creditors, who are the real parties in interest here, want to retain the trustee.","start":994.449,"stop":1001.346,"duration":6.9},{"text":"Not a single creditor, not one, has come forward to object to the employment of the trustee by the reorganized company.","start":1001.346,"stop":1010.891,"duration":9.54},{"text":"These creditors of course are now the new stockholders, the new owners of the reorganized company.","start":1010.891,"stop":1017.381,"duration":6.49},{"text":"On the contrary, they have urged to the District Court the approval of his appointment or his being a director and the president of the reorganized company.","start":1017.381,"stop":1029.849,"duration":12.47},{"text":"Third, substantial consummation of this plan has taken place as I have previously described to this Court.","start":1029.849,"stop":1039.51,"duration":9.66},{"text":"And it would certainly serve no useful purpose in this case to prohibit his future employment because of a -- an alleged statutory pass disqualification to serve his trustee.","start":1039.51,"stop":1054.07,"duration":14.56},{"text":"And finally, it is apparent from the record in this case as the District Court so found that the best interest of the reorganized company require to re -- they require the retention of the valuable services of the trustee and his management team.","start":1054.07,"stop":1072.976,"duration":18.91},{"text":"I would like to -- unless the Court has some questions on that point, I would like to go to the next
