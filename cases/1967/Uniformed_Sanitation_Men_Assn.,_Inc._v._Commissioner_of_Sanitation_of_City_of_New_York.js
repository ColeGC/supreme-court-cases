answer.","start":645.219,"stop":653.877,"duration":8.66},{"text":"This being a refusal to answer in a criminal investigation cannot be used as a basis for dismissing a public employee even if an

questions.","start":653.877,"stop":679.593,"duration":25.72},{"text":"And let me proceed, if I may Your Honors, with my first point which is one upon which rely on most because there is less dispute

construction never changed by the New York Court of Appeals in the Daniman case.","start":723.169,"stop":732.424,"duration":9.25},{"text":"Where the Court of Appeals of New York stated, the assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination is equivalent to a resignation.","start":732.424,"stop":743.809,"duration":11.38},{"text":"And it's said there is nothing noble about such a

of the charter.","start":803.605,"stop":819.988,"duration":16.38},{"text":"And Mr. Justice Clark in the Nelson case and Mr. Justice Harlan in Lerner against Casey reiterated the fact that this Charter
