suit.","start":170.305,"stop":193.762,"duration":23.46},{"text":"It's our contention that unlike the companion suit of Massachusetts against Mellon, which may -- which we are willing to concede may

can't go to court and get it attacked and get it declared constitutional.","start":685.377,"stop":691.059,"duration":5.68},{"text":"You have to wait until it's administered and then it comes up to initial question, did the administration complied with the statutory intent?","start":691.059,"stop":700.351,"duration":9.29},{"text":"But that you may find it difficult to appreciate why the

if you want two examples, the Court asserts that if Frothingham were allowed to sue, there would be the danger of a multitude of these civil suits and this is of course the practical point, you pointed out so strong, it's a practical thing, not jurisdictional.","start":871.229,"stop":891.054,"duration":19.82},{"text":"The Court would not have raised -- asserted that practical consideration

discretion.","start":990.743,"stop":994.513,"duration":3.77},{"text":"It's not a question of constitutional jurisdiction, so the point I am making is that the examination of Frothingham on its face
