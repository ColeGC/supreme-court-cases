violation.","start":622.956,"stop":653.032,"duration":30.08},{"text":"All I'm saying is that although there may be situations at the periphery as to whether the filing of a charge is a Section 7

violations of the statue and I think that that is all that we have to show to get in the ball park here.","start":665.56,"stop":683.376,"duration":17.82},{"text":"Now, I'd like to turn to the one other thing under Section 7 and to put and that is that if the individual is protected in his right to file a charge he has the right to file the charge under the act is promptly as possible as this Court pointed out in a decision earlier this term there is no requirement in the National Labor Relations Act for the exhaustion of administrative remedies.","start":683.376,"stop":719.091,"duration":35.72},{"text":"It's a matter of fact, Section 10 (a) of the Act says that the board's power shall not be affected by any other private means of adjustment and Section 10 (b) of the Act which sets a six months statute of limitations period indeed encourages a prompt filing of charges so that we start then at least in our view of it with a situation where the union by expelling Holder for filing charges with the board promptly without exhausting his internal union remedy in a very real sense has restraint or coerced him in a exercising freely the right that Section 7 would give him the file such a charge promptly irrespective of whether an investigation it prove to have merit as long at least is there was no showing that he acted in bad faith and there is none here.","start":719.091,"stop":783.003,"duration":63.91},{"text":"So, then we come to the problem as to whether or not this restraint or coercion is legal restraint or coercion and that brings us to the proviso of the 8 (b) (1) (a) and to this Court's decision in the Allis-Chalmers case.","start":783.003,"stop":800.513,"duration":17.51},{"text":"Now, for the union this is a very easy case.","start":800.513,"stop":805.059,"duration":4.55},{"text":"They read the terms of the proviso and they say that this exhaustion requirement was a membership requirement which Holder a great too when he joined the union by violating this membership requirement.","start":805.059,"stop":823.169,"duration":18.11},{"text":"The union had disciplined and that ends the ball game for them because they apply the plain meaning rule and they say how plainer can you get something that fits within the terms of the statute.","start":823.169,"stop":838.095,"duration":14.93},{"text":"Now, I admit that that is a persuasive argument however, this Court has often times cautioned that a plain meaning rule particularly with respect to Section 8 (b) (1) (a) is not a very reliable guide as to the reach of the provision but you have to look at the statute in the light of its legislative history and even more importantly in the light of the other provisions of the statute because Congress in enacting Section 8 (b) (1) (a) was trying to fit it into a unified statutory pattern.","start":838.095,"stop":880.726,"duration":42.63},{"text":"Now, when we look at the unified statutory pattern, what do we find?","start":880.726,"stop":885.933,"duration":5.21},{"text":"Well, we find first of all as I've indicated that under Section 10 (b) of the Act the board cannot act unless a charge is filed.","start":885.933,"stop":897.498,"duration":11.57},{"text":"You look at the employer's side of the picture and you find that employer coercion in respect to the filing of charges is prohibited.","start":897.498,"stop":906.563,"duration":9.06},{"text":"It's not only prohibited it's specifically under Section 8 (a) (4) but it has been held even by the court below that such employer coercion is been held to violate the general terms of Section 8 (a) (1) of the statute which bars employer in general terms restraint coercion and the exercise of Section 7 rights.","start":906.563,"stop":935.298,"duration":28.74},{"text":"Now, looking at those provisions this Court in the Nash case earlier this term said this indicates that Congress intended that an individual would be free of all coercion in respect to the filing of unfair labor practice charges.","start":935.298,"stop":959.533,"duration":24.24},{"text":"As a matter of fact the Court said, employer and union coercion and referred to the Roberts case, Nash to be sure that not involve a union coercion and involved the question as to whether or not State of Florida's policy of denying an individual unemployment compensation because he had filed charges was in conflict with the scheme of the act.","start":959.533,"stop":990.421,"duration":30.89},{"text":"So then we say in the light of this statutory pattern it is reasonable for the board to read the general restraint and coercion terms of Section 8 (b) (1) (a) as affording the same protection against union coercion in respect for the filing of charges that 8 (a) (1) of the Act provides against employer coercion.","start":990.421,"stop":1023.062,"duration":32.64},{"text":"Now, in the Allis-Chalmers case which was decided last term this Court held that Section 8 (b) (1) (a) did not bar a union from finding those of its members who refused to heed the union's strike ball and seeking to collect those fines by state court suits.","start":1023.062,"stop":1050.637,"duration":27.57},{"text":"Now, in reaching that conclusion the Court relied upon two principle things as I read the decision.","start":1050.637,"stop":1060.119,"duration":9.48},{"text":"One, that the right to strike was an important weapon in the union's economic arsenal and unless it had a power to find strike breakers, the right to strike would be substantially impaired and secondly, that as the Court read the legislative history of Section 8 (b) (1) (a) and its proviso it indicated that Congress did not propose any limitation with respect to the internal affairs of a labor union.","start":1060.119,"stop":1102.495,"duration":42.38},{"text":"Now, I should point out that as the Court is well aware that Allis-Chalmers was a five to four decision and Mr. Justice White in his concurring opinion indicated that he did not read the majority opinion as privileging any union rule no matter how unreasonable or unenforceable on its face.","start":1102.495,"stop":1135.338,"duration":32.84},{"text":"It appeared to be.","start":1135.338,"stop":1137.384,"duration":2.05},{"text":"Now, apart from that however we submit that as Mr.-- as Judge Fay pointed out for the Court of Appeals in the Roberts case that a union rule that would penalize employees for filing charges with the board goes beyond the area of internal union affairs
