Internal Revenue Code, which establishes the basic six-year period of limitations in this kind of case.","start":385.852,"stop":405.447,"duration":19.6},{"text":"And towards the beginning of this

the commission of the offense.","start":405.447,"stop":425.325,"duration":19.88},{"text":"The other part of the statute of 6531 as an issue here is the very last sentence and it reads “for the purpose of determining the periods of limitation on criminal prosecutions, the rules of Section 6513 should be applicable.”","start":425.325,"stop":445.998,"duration":20.67},{"text":"And the precise and narrow question here is.","start":445.998,"stop":449.584,"duration":3.59},{"text":"What are these rules of Section 6513?","start":449.584,"stop":453.784,"duration":4.2},{"text":"Do any of them apply to bar the prosecution in this case?","start":453.784,"stop":458.901,"duration":5.12},{"text":"Section 6513 itself states a variety of rules for creating deemed times or artificial times of filing

in the Tax Court for redertermination.","start":458.901,"stop":489.995,"duration":31.09},{"text":"The only part of Section 6513 that is invoked here is the first part, 6513(a).","start":489.995,"stop":499.649,"duration":9.65},{"text":"The Government's contention, I think, is simple as that the first two words in the title of the subsection resolve the case and that everything else in the case is consistent with and confirms that view.","start":499.649,"stop":517.111,"duration":17.46},{"text":"Those two words are ‘early return'.","start":517.111,"stop":520.514,"duration":3.4},{"text":"The entire title of this subsection (a) is ‘Early Return or Advance Payment of Tax'.","start":520.514,"stop":529.348,"duration":8.83},{"text":"There are three sentences in this Section.","start":529.348,"stop":533.636,"duration":4.29},{"text":"The first one and the second one are very similar, except that the first one deals with advance filings, which is the early return in the title.","start":533.636,"stop":544.521,"duration":10.88},{"text":"The second one deals with advance payments or the advance payment of tax in the title.","start":544.521,"stop":551.516,"duration":7},{"text":"The first -- now, the first sentence says, for the purposes of Section 6511, which deals with claims for refund and limits on refunds and credits, any return filed before the last day prescribed for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day.","start":551.516,"stop":575.53,"duration":24.01},{"text":"The second sentence is very similar, again referring to other sections in this vicinity of the code relating to limits on credits and the like.","start":575.53,"stop":585.181,"duration":9.65},{"text":"It says, for purposes of Section 6511(b) (2) and (c) in 6512, payment of any portion of the tax made before the last day prescribed for the payment of the tax shall be considered made on such last day.","start":585.181,"stop":604.05,"duration":18.87},{"text":"Both of these sentences have the same operative phrase, “before the last day prescribed”; and the first sentence “last day prescribed for filing” and the second “for payment”.","start":604.05,"stop":618.105,"duration":14.06},{"text":"Now, in the abstract, viewing these two sentences alone, this phrase “the last day prescribed” can have several meanings because deadlines under the tax code are prescribed in several ways.","start":618.105,"stop":633.125,"duration":15.02},{"text":"It could mean the day prescribed by statute as in the case of income tax returns, prescribed by regulations as in the case of certain excised taxes.","start":633.125,"stop":643.963,"duration":10.84},{"text":"It could mean deadlines for payment of tax prescribed by elections that the taxpayer can make such as under certain state tax provisions or could mean the last day prescribed by extensions given by the Commissioner under his discretionary authority.","start":643.963,"stop":664.739,"duration":20.78},{"text":"This function of the third sentence, in our view, the third and last sentence of this section is to define and to delimit this phrase, “the last day prescribed” that occurs in each of the first two sentences.","start":664.739,"stop":681.854,"duration":17.12},{"text":"The full text of that very sentence is for purposes of this subsection.","start":681.854,"stop":689.036,"duration":7.18},{"text":"The last day prescribed for filing the return or paying the tax shall be determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer and without regard to any election to pay the tax in installments.","start":689.036,"stop":707.517,"duration":18.48},{"text":"Now, as the Government has read the statute and as the Government has urged the courts to construe it, the purpose and the only purpose of this last sentence is to eliminate two of the four possible meanings of the phrase “the last day prescribed” that appears in the first two sentences.","start":707.517,"stop":731.42,"duration":23.9},{"text":"So that with this third sentence, the first two sentences mean that an early return is only that filed before the last day prescribed by statute or regulations.","start":731.42,"stop":745.127,"duration":13.71},{"text":"It does not define as an early return, one filed before the last day prescribed by this in extension of time.","start":745.127,"stop":755.634,"duration":10.51},{"text":"It does not -- it takes outside the word “advance payment of tax,” a payment made after the statutory or regulation deadline based on the taxpayer's election to pay in installments.","start":755.634,"stop":770.662,"duration":15.03},{"text":"So it means that this section prescribes rules only for returns filed, payments made before deadlines prescribed by statute or regulation.","start":770.662,"stop":785.441,"duration":14.78},{"text":"As we point out in our brief, the legislative history supports this view.","start":785.441,"stop":792.057,"duration":6.62},{"text":"The committee reports, when this language was first inserted in ‘39 Code and ‘42, the committee report on Section 6513(a) when it was continued in the 1954 Code, both made clear that this is what the Congress had in mind.","start":792.057,"stop":811.833,"duration":19.78}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"What's the

law.","start":825.209,"stop":850.26,"duration":25.05},{"text":"What this -- our reading of this third sentence, thus, it say that those people who file after April 15th count their six years from the day they actually filed.","start":850.26,"stop":861.431,"duration":11.17},{"text":"And this -- in terms of the great group of taxpayers, this works advantageous for both sides; it gives taxpayers

rare.","start":888.158,"stop":898.48,"duration":10.32},{"text":"Now, we don't understand the appellees to disagree with this reading of the statute for civil purposes.","start":898.48,"stop":907.06,"duration":8.58},{"text":"They never concede that it's correct for civil purposes but they don't dispute it and they suggest that it may be correct for civil purposes.","start":907.06,"stop":917.1,"duration":10.04},{"text":"But their position is that it has a somewhat different meaning in criminal
