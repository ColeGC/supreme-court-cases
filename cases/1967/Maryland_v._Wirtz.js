Court.","start":62.54,"stop":66.483,"duration":3.94},{"text":"This appeal asks whether the 1966 Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act which I shall refer to hereafter as Public Law 89601 are constitutional.","start":66.483,"stop":79.092,"duration":12.61},{"text":"Specifically, it asks whether or not Congress can extend the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and local school and hospital employees.","start":79.092,"stop":89.54,"duration":10.45},{"text":"Now leaving aside for the moment the question of the Eleventh Amendment and the statutory question of whether the states or the ultimate consumers of the goods which they purchase in Commerce, we view this case as involving two essential issues.","start":89.54,"stop":105.597,"duration":16.06},{"text":"We do not of course mean to abandon either the Eleventh Amendment or the statutory construction argument, but we would prefer to rest upon our brief as to those arguments.","start":105.597,"stop":117.298,"duration":11.7},{"text":"The first issue is whether the activity being regulated has a sufficiently substantial effect on interstate commerce to be constitutionally regulable by Congress.","start":117.298,"stop":128.929,"duration":11.63},{"text":"Now, this does not involve any consideration of whether the Commerce Clause is plenary or exclusive or just how powerful it is.","start":128.929,"stop":137.531,"duration":8.6},{"text":"It does not involve the Tenth Amendment.","start":137.531,"stop":140.149,"duration":2.62},{"text":"The only consideration here is whether the activity is or affects commerce in such a way as to make it regulable per se.","start":140.149,"stop":149.961,"duration":9.81},{"text":"The second issue is if the Court in examining the activities under consideration, determines that they are or substantially affect commerce, it must then determine the nature and extent of the commerce power.","start":149.961,"stop":164.684,"duration":14.72},{"text":"It is at this point that the question of whether our federal system itself is an implied limitation on the commerce power comes into play.","start":164.684,"stop":174.728,"duration":10.04},{"text":"Now there are as the Court may know, 28 states who are appellants here, obviously more than one point of view has been expressed.","start":174.728,"stop":183.858,"duration":9.13},{"text":"Professor Wright my co-counsel in his brief has addressed himself primarily to the first issue and he will argue that today.","start":183.858,"stop":192.515,"duration":8.66},{"text":"Accordingly, I shall address myself to the second issue that is whether assuming that the activities affect commerce or our commerce the fact that they are carried on by states under the circumstances present here precludes Congress from regulating them in a way that it is sought to do.","start":192.515,"stop":212.431,"duration":19.92},{"text":"Now we assert initially as our basis, as this Court itself said in the case of Texas versus White that the preservation of the states and the maintenance of their governments is as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the union and the maintenance of the national government.","start":212.431,"stop":232.615,"duration":20.18},{"text":"We start with that as our premise.","start":232.615,"stop":235.255,"duration":2.64},{"text":"Less it'd be said that this is a pass√©, no longer good law, I would point out to the Court that this very language and this very context was cited with approval by Mr. Justice Frankfurter only eight years ago in the concurring opinion in United States versus Florida, reported at 363 U.S. 121 his particular language at 132.","start":235.255,"stop":260.978,"duration":25.72},{"text":"The Secretary of Labor asserts that this is no consideration in ascertaining the scope of the commerce power and for that, he relies on language of this Court in the cases of United States versus California, 297 U.S., Case versus Bowles, reported at 327 U.S. and Board of Trustees versus United States reported at 289 U.S.","start":260.978,"stop":285.073,"duration":24.09},{"text":"Now, it is our position that the actual decisions in these cases are not controlling here that the degree of federal intrusion upon the states is entirely different and so are its effects and we urge that the Court reconsider the dicta and we submit and will attempt to demonstrate that that's all that it was that the Court reconsider the dicta in those cases in the light of the facts involved here and because this is central to our argument, I would like to develop this in some depth now.","start":285.073,"stop":318.003,"duration":32.93},{"text":"As we point out in our brief, from almost the very beginning, there had been an implied limitation upon the national taxing power where state governmental activities were concerned and until the case of United States versus California, there had been no occasion to conclude that the commerce power was not subject to the same limitation.","start":318.003,"stop":340.478,"duration":22.48},{"text":"At least, I might point out that in the California case where the distinction, so far as I'm able to determine was for the first time made, the Court cited no previous authority for making the distinction between the taxing and commerce power and I refer to the Court to 297 U.S. at page 185 where this distinction was first made.","start":340.478,"stop":362.033,"duration":21.56},{"text":"In California of course, the question was whether the state owned belt railway was subject to the Safety Appliance Act.","start":362.033,"stop":370.814,"duration":8.78},{"text":"California argued that the railroad was owned and operated as a sovereign function of the state, relying on the doctrine of immunity which had been evolved from the tax cases.","start":370.814,"stop":381.495,"duration":10.68},{"text":"Now the Court never stopped to analyze even, whether even under the taxing doctrine, that is with the limitations imposed upon the taxing power, the railroad would be immune.","start":381.495,"stop":392.993,"duration":11.5},{"text":"But instead asserted, I submit quite unnecessarily, that the limitations applicable to the taxing power were not applicable to the commerce power and on that basis, the railroad could be regulated.","start":392.993,"stop":406.48,"duration":13.49},{"text":"Now, I say that the distinction raised in that case was unnecessary because the facts will demonstrate that the railroad was not only regulable under the commerce power, but also taxable under the taxing power.","start":406.48,"stop":419.959,"duration":13.48},{"text":"In the later case, in the State of California versus Anglim decided some seven years after the California case in this Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the same belt railroad was not immune from the federal carrier's tax of 1937.","start":419.959,"stop":437.424,"duration":17.46},{"text":"I might mention that perhaps the Chief Justice may have some special recollection of that case having come up under his tenure as Attorney General of California.","start":437.424,"stop":448.11,"duration":10.69},{"text":"The District Court in the Anglim case expressly held that the railroad was not an essentially and traditionally governmental function and for that reason was taxable.","start":448.11,"stop":459.844,"duration":11.73},{"text":"This decision is reported at 37 Fed Supp at page 667.","start":459.844,"stop":465.078,"duration":5.23},{"text":"The Circuit Court agreed entirely with the lower court's approach reporting its decision at 129 F2nd 460.","start":465.078,"stop":474.93,"duration":9.85},{"text":"The Circuit Court also went on the theory that the Taxing Act was a commerce regulation, but it expressly agreed with the District Court's conclusion that as a factual matter, it was -- the railroad was also taxable under the taxing power.","start":474.93,"stop":490.333,"duration":15.4},{"text":"This Court denied certiorari at 317 U.S. 669 and in fact I think had implicitly accepted the Circuit and District Court approaches in the earlier case of California versus Latimer at 305 U.S. 255 where it sustained a different aspect of the carrier's tax of 1937 against the very same belt railroad.","start":490.333,"stop":515.638,"duration":25.31},{"text":"Thus, I submit to the Court that the distinction raised in the first California case with respect to the very activity which was there under consideration amounted to unnecessary dicta.","start":515.638,"stop":528.46,"duration":12.82},{"text":"The same result would have been reached whether the taxing power or the commerce power was involved.","start":528.46,"stop":534.845,"duration":6.38},{"text":"The railroad was not an essentially -- an essential governmental function and that is why it could be regulated and taxed.","start":534.845,"stop":543.854,"duration":9.01},{"text":"Now the idea that the taxing power is somehow less potent or somehow more limited than the commerce power it was not supported by precedent and in fact was rejected later by this Court.","start":543.854,"stop":558.609,"duration":14.75},{"text":"As a general proposition, the taxing power has been described many times by this Court in the same broad way as it has described the commerce power.","start":558.609,"stop":568.905,"duration":10.3},{"text":"In Tanner versus Little for example, an early case reported the 240 U.S. 369, the Court said that the power of taxation is as extensive as the range of subjects over which the government extends.","start":568.905,"stop":582.905,"duration":14},{"text":"It is absolute and unlimited in the absence of constitutional limitations and restraints and carries with it the power to embarrass and destroy.","start":582.905,"stop":592.849,"duration":9.94},{"text":"Not only has a taxing power been described in this very broad way on its own but it has also been equated with the other plenary enumerated powers.","start":592.849,"stop":604.399,"duration":11.55},{"text":"In the case of Ashton versus Cameron County for example, reported at 298 U.S. 513, which I might add was decided after the California case, the Court equated the tax and the bankruptcy powers stating ‚Äúboth powers are granted by the same section of the Constitution and we can find no reason for saying that one is implied limited by the necessity of preserving independence of the states while the other is not.‚Äù","start":604.399,"stop":635.035,"duration":30.64},{"text":"Even more specifically to the point, ‚Äúthe Court in the same case stated at page 532 that for a very long time, this Court has steadfastly adhered to the doctrine that the taxing power of Congress does not extend to the states where there are political subdivisions.","start":635.035,"stop":652.006,"duration":16.97},{"text":"The same basic reasoning which leads to that conclusion we think, requires like limitation upon the power which springs from the Bankruptcy Clause.‚Äù","start":652.006,"stop":663.244,"duration":11.24},{"text":"Later, in the case of New York versus United States, the famous tax case with the mineral waters Justice Frankfurter referring to the California case stated, ‚Äúthat surely the power of Congress to lay taxes has impliedly no lesser reach in the power of Congress to regulate commerce.‚Äù","start":663.244,"stop":683.08,"duration":19.84},{"text":"Now, it serves no real purpose I think to bounce cases back off against one another.","start":683.08,"stop":691.277,"duration":8.2},{"text":"What we must do now is look to the basic underlying legal concepts which are involved.","start":691.277,"stop":698.325,"duration":7.05},{"text":"Now in California, the Court assumed that the reason for the limitation on the taxing power was to enable each government to tax freely.","start":698.325,"stop":706.926,"duration":8.6},{"text":"This is what it said.","start":706.926,"stop":708.871,"duration":1.94},{"text":"In the earlier case of Metcalf versus Mitchell however, the Court stated the rationale in this words, ‚Äúbut neither government may destroy the other nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise of its powers.‚Äù","start":708.871,"stop":724.205,"duration":15.33},{"text":"Now, this I submit is a far broader basis for the limitation than that which was expressed in the California case and I think it strikes more to the heart of the matter.","start":724.205,"stop":734.612,"duration":10.41},{"text":"It is also the approach which was adopted by all eight justices in the case of New York versus United States.","start":734.612,"stop":742.117,"duration":7.5},{"text":"Justice Frankfurter stated in the New York case that ‚Äúthe fact that ours is a federal constitutional system as expressly recognized in the Tenth Amendment carries with it implications regarding the taxing power as in other aspects of government,‚Äù citing his authority, Hopkins Federal versus Cleary, which of course involved a limitation on the commerce and banking powers.","start":742.117,"stop":769.728,"duration":27.61},{"text":"Now, as a result of the Anglim cases, the California belt railroad tax cases as a result of Ashton versus Cameron and of New York versus United States and as a result of the other cases which we cite in our brief and which I don't think it's important to go into at this stage, it would appear that the distinction which was raised in the first California case was inappropriate and no longer recognized, but then it was repeated in the case of Case versus Bowles reported at 327 U.S. 92.","start":769.728,"stop":803.022,"duration":33.29},{"text":"Now, in Case versus Bowles, the Court rejected the distinction between essential and nonessential state functions with respect to the war power because it appeared to be unworkable.","start":803.022,"stop":814.765,"duration":11.74},{"text":"This is what the Court said, citing the New York tax case in which the Court was unable to arrive at any agreement as to where the balance would be struck.","start":814.765,"stop":825.574,"duration":10.81},{"text":"Based upon the New York case, the court just said, -- simply said, it seemed to me that ‚Äúwe can't work out any kind of balance therefore there isn't any.‚Äù","start":825.574,"stop":835.006,"duration":9.43},{"text":"Now, in that case, the question was whether the power of the State of Washington to sell timber to the highest bider was subordinate to the OPA Ceiling Price Regulations which had been issued pursuant to the war power.","start":835.006,"stop":850.287,"duration":15.28},{"text":"In that context, the essential and nonessential distinction which had been raised as a test by some of the justices in the New York tax case which had been accepted before in tax cases may well had been unworkable and maybe that distinction is unworkable here.","start":850.287,"stop":868.312,"duration":18.02},{"text":"But even that would not mean that no limitation is to be implied because I submit that theory itself would be unworkable.","start":868.312,"stop":876.602,"duration":8.29},{"text":"To demonstrate this, I ask the Court to look at what Public Law 89601 actually does.","start":876.602,"stop":884.727,"duration":8.13},{"text":"Now in the middle of a fiscal year that is after state budgets had already been enacted, after the next necessary taxes had been levy, along comes Congress and raises the pay of state employees.","start":884.727,"stop":898.238,"duration":13.51},{"text":"Now we stipulated below and the record will indicate that the cost of this to the state just the monetary cost alone would be enormous, perhaps $100 million to $200 million annually, whether it's 200 or 100 we submit as terribly significant, but it would be somewhere in that neighborhood for the first year of operation.","start":898.238,"stop":919.818,"duration":21.58},{"text":"Of course
