requirements.","start":352.777,"stop":371.97,"duration":19.19},{"text":"They say number one, you’ve got to, the foreign government must, a foreign country must allow American citizens the same Rights

Court has construed that requirement to mean that unless an American citizen can say I want my money in American dollars right now unconditionally, immediately then, and they don’t give it because the country has foreign exchange control regulations, which every county has including our own, that then the right to take, the Right to Inherit is destroyed because the right to receive and to receive immediately not conditionally and not tomorrow, the next day but today that destroys the right to Inherit and this is been the holding of the California Supreme Court, its been the holding of the Supreme Court in the State of Oregon repeatedly.","start":402.238,"stop":442.663,"duration":40.43},{"text":"On top of that, I’d like to say here for just a moment, that these two requirements of the statute are almost identical with the statute as it was at the time Clark versus Allen was decided and the date of that case was 1942, those two requirements; the no discrimination and the right to immediate payment of an inheritance were in the California Statute.","start":442.663,"stop":465.753,"duration":23.09},{"text":"Now Oregon in 1951 when they adapted this statute with which we are concerned put in another requirement.","start":465.753,"stop":472.868,"duration":7.12},{"text":"They said that the alien, nonresident alien must have the free use benefit and control of his money

it.","start":485.46,"stop":500.76,"duration":15.3},{"text":"In those states, by statute the surrogate's probate judges may order actual distribution if in their opinion the foreign heir is not going

Circuit Court Act was before this Court in Ioannou versus New York in 1962 in which the Court declined to take jurisdiction because it felt there were no substantial Federal question.","start":518.366,"stop":534.498,"duration":16.13},{"text":"However Mr. Justice Douglas joined by Mr. Justice Black filed a dissent in which they said that they felt that it was time to reexamine Clark versus Allen, that this issue was not foreclosed by Clark versus Allen.","start":534.498,"stop":550.97,"duration":16.47},{"text":"So, then as I say on the top of pre-use benefit and

Oregon.","start":550.97,"stop":569.214,"duration":18.24},{"text":"Now obviously no foreign country is ever going to admit or say or confess that they are confiscating anything much less an inheritance coming from an estate from the state of Oregon to them.","start":569.214,"stop":581.905,"duration":12.69},{"text":"How you can prove that, that they do or don’t is something that I think no one can answer.","start":581.905,"stop":588.439,"duration":6.53},{"text":"However, the Supreme Court of Oregon found it very, very convenient answer to that.","start":588.439,"stop":594.685,"duration":6.25},{"text":"It came out the estate of Pikaicho (ph), these are cited in my brief, a Czechoslovak, a man who was a resident of Czechoslovakia,

Portland.","start":594.685,"stop":616.487,"duration":21.8},{"text":"And he lived and there was no question about him being a domiciliary, he died some eight or ten years after he had returned home, he left his bank account.","start":616.487,"stop":626.347,"duration":9.86},{"text":"In that case involving Czechoslovakia, the Court escheated it, disregarded the rule that the law of the domicile of decedent governs the succession of personal property, ignored that or refused to adopt it that way and escheated the estate.","start":626.347,"stop":644.206,"duration":17.86},{"text":"And they decided it on this third ground which I just mentioned by simply saying that Czechoslovakia is on the list of the Treasury Department Circular 655, which is a circular issued under a Federal regulation that no checks of United States, well the United States Treasury maybe sent to that country.","start":644.206,"stop":667.426,"duration":23.22},{"text":"And as a result of that no social security checks, no veteran checks, no subject of that kind go to these countries.","start":667.426,"stop":674.034,"duration":6.61},{"text":"They are, they’re what you might say the Communist led countries, Red China, the North Korea, North Vietnam and so forth, Soviet Union is also on it and Czechoslovakia also was at that time and still is I would say.","start":674.034,"stop":688.658,"duration":14.62},{"text":"But anyway they said that the very fact that Czechoslovakia was on that Treasury Department list of countries that in itself was evidence that that was at least partial confiscation by the government of Czechoslovakia of the inheritances of these people and therefore on basis of that they escheated the estate.","start":688.658,"stop":710.746,"duration":22.09},{"text":"Now as I said again the fundamental question is may any State of the Union lay down its own conditions and say to the foreign country if you don’t confirm your inheritance laws to ours your people can’t inherit.","start":710.746,"stop":727.798,"duration":17.05},{"text":"If you do not allow American citizens immediate payment disregard your foreign exchange control or disregard any internal laws that you may have to govern your foreign -- supply, if you withhold that money for, even in instance if he can’t have it on demand that then there the prosecution fails and we will began to confiscate your people’s inheritance.","start":727.798,"stop":751.814,"duration":24.02},{"text":"On the third requirement they say if you don’t give these people the free use benefit and control of the money whatever these words mean, they can mean almost anything, but they say if you don’t give them the free use benefit and control of that money and if you confiscate any portion of it then we again will not allow you to inherit.","start":751.814,"stop":772.203,"duration":20.39}]},{"speakerName":"Abe
