Circuit.","start":35.484,"stop":43.823,"duration":8.34},{"text":"It began when the petitioner, the Secretary of Labor sued in the District Court in the Southern District of New York to set aside an election that the respondent, a local union held in May 1965.","start":43.823,"stop":61.757,"duration":17.93},{"text":"The issues arise under Title IV of the Labor Reform Law of 1959 which is commonly known as the Landrum-Griffin Act.","start":61.757,"stop":73.513,"duration":11.76},{"text":"As the Court knows, the scheme of that title is to set forth in one elaborate section, Section 401, a variety of conditions and requirements that are applied to the union elections.","start":73.513,"stop":90.019,"duration":16.51},{"text":"The first issue in this case involves one of those requirements drawing out of a provision of Section 401(e) which is contained in the appendix to our brief towards the top of page 40.","start":90.019,"stop":107.7,"duration":17.68},{"text":"That provision, Section 401(e), among other things deals with qualifications that a union may impose upon those who wish to be candidates for elective office.","start":107.7,"stop":119.354,"duration":11.65},{"text":"And it says that all members in good standing shall be eligible subject to and this is the pertinent statutory language, “reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed.”","start":119.354,"stop":132.933,"duration":13.58},{"text":"The respondent applied what the district judge has called a prior office holding requirement.","start":132.933,"stop":139.784,"duration":6.85},{"text":"It required those who wish to be candidates for anyone of the 31 paid full-time positions open in the May 1965 election, to have previously been members of the body of the union called its assembly which existed since 1951 or instead to have been members of a body called all the old Shop Delegates Council which existed before 1951.","start":139.784,"stop":168.007,"duration":28.22},{"text":"Our contention which the District Court accepted and the majority of the Court of Appeals rejected is that this is an unreasonable requirement within the intention of the statute.","start":168.007,"stop":180.155,"duration":12.15},{"text":"The second issue before the Court grows out of the procedures established in Section 402 for remedying defective elections.","start":180.155,"stop":189.107,"duration":8.95},{"text":"That section sets up a multistage procedure.","start":189.107,"stop":193.387,"duration":4.28},{"text":"The union member who is dissatisfied must exhaust internal remedies.","start":193.387,"stop":197.37,"duration":3.98},{"text":"He complains to the Secretary, the Secretary investigates and then if he

supervision.","start":197.37,"stop":213.62,"duration":16.25},{"text":"The second problem here goes to the conditions the statute prescribes as the requisite to the grant of the relief of a new election.","start":213.62,"stop":224.769,"duration":11.15},{"text":"The statutory language is in Section 402(c) which is towards the bottom of page 42 of our brief, and it says that the election shall not be set aside unless the District Court finds that a violation of Section 401 may have affected the outcome of the election.","start":224.769,"stop":247.123,"duration":22.35},{"text":"The District Court here held that even though the prior office holding requirement wasn't its view unreasonable, it could not say that the imposition of that requirement may have affected the outcome of the election and we contest that ruling here as well.","start":247.123,"stop":264.501,"duration":17.38},{"text":"There's a third question that need not be reached if the first two are answered in the Secretary's favor.","start":264.501,"stop":273.395,"duration":8.89},{"text":"And this was a question akin to that previously decided by this Court this term in the Local 125 of the Laborer's Union case.","start":273.395,"stop":283.092,"duration":9.7},{"text":"It goes to the relationship that must exist between the charges the Secretary makes in Court and those that union member makes in his complaint to the Secretary.","start":283.092,"stop":295.843,"duration":12.75},{"text":"Here, the union members complained only with the prior office holding requirement, both within the union and to

question.","start":311.475,"stop":318.954,"duration":7.48},{"text":"The Secretary in his investigation believed he had uncovered evidence of three additional violations of Section 401 committed in

polls.","start":318.954,"stop":340.749,"duration":21.8},{"text":"The district judge struck these allegations on the ground that the union members have not complained upon and the Court of Appeals affirmed.","start":340.749,"stop":351.402,"duration":10.65},{"text":"There's also a fourth question which has been interposed, I believe, for the first time in respondent's brief in this Court and we have not dealt with it in our brief and I will after stating the facts and this is an argument that because the respondent has changed his prior office holding requirement and plans to hold a new election about three weeks from now that this case is moot.","start":351.402,"stop":378.694,"duration":27.29},{"text":"Now, if I may, I should like to turn to the facts of this case which are rather complex because of the complex organization that this union has given its government.","start":378.694,"stop":394.083,"duration":15.39},{"text":"The union represents, at least to the time of the May 1965 election, approximately 27,000 people employed in hotels, motels and private clubs in the New York City area.","start":394.083,"stop":410.003,"duration":15.92},{"text":"I believe it covered all boroughs except Staten Island.","start":410.003,"stop":414.704,"duration":4.7},{"text":"The union for purposes of its internal government is divided into seven districts.","start":414.704,"stop":420.954,"duration":6.25},{"text":"Six of these are geographic and each of the geographic districts covers all of the hotels and motels within its

jurisdiction.","start":432.361,"stop":440.145,"duration":7.78},{"text":"The union, both with -- the union as a whole within the district's -- within each hotel or motel or club is divided into departments or craft units and there are basically five of these.","start":440.145,"stop":456.642,"duration":16.5},{"text":"The housekeeping workers, the kitchen workers, the dining room workers, the banquet workers and bar workers, each have a department, a craft organization.","start":456.642,"stop":468.914,"duration":12.27},{"text":"And then within each hotel, this craft organization is reflected in the composition of the shops.","start":468.914,"stop":475.11,"duration":6.2},{"text":"Each dining room is a shop, each banquet room, each bar and so forth.","start":475.11,"stop":483.031,"duration":7.92},{"text":"Now, the general organization of the overall government of the union is somewhat complex and the hope that it might aid rather than add to confusion, I've had prepared a rather summary chart of the union's overall government and ask the clerk to distribute it to Your Honors.","start":483.031,"stop":510.534,"duration":27.5},{"text":"And if I may before coming back to the craft organization, I'd like to describe the people who are listed on this chart and how they are chosen.","start":510.534,"stop":522.4,"duration":11.87},{"text":"Because it is only the people listed on this chart who, since 1951, have been eligible to run for the full-time paid positions.","start":522.4,"stop":535.089,"duration":12.69},{"text":"At the top of the union, their major officers are four general officers, the president, the secretary treasure, the general organizer and the recording secretary.","start":535.089,"stop":548.641,"duration":13.55},{"text":"These are elected by the membership at large.","start":548.641,"stop":554.13,"duration":5.49},{"text":"Next, there are seven vice presidents who are elected from the seven districts that I mentioned before.","start":554.13,"stop":561.049,"duration":6.92},{"text":"One from each and each vice president is essentially the presiding officer of his district.","start":561.049,"stop":568.903,"duration":7.85},{"text":"Now, there is a provision for other vice presidents to be appointed by the assembly.","start":568.903,"stop":575.854,"duration":6.95},{"text":"The record is silent on when this provision whether this provision has ever been invoked.","start":575.854,"stop":580.865,"duration":5.01},{"text":"The respondent asserts that is not and we know of no evidence to the contrary.","start":580.865,"stop":585.415,"duration":4.55},{"text":"But the provision is intended to allow other vice presidents to be appointed by the assembly for the purpose of making sure that there is at least one vice president from each of the crafts.","start":585.415,"stop":600.484,"duration":15.07},{"text":"Then, there are 10 delegates to the New York Hotel and Motel Trades
