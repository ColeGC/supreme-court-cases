ways.","start":804.651,"stop":814.087,"duration":9.44},{"text":"Should everything be disclosed to A and his counsel even though the conversations are of other people who had no reason to expect that their conversations would be overheard.","start":814.087,"stop":825.479,"duration":11.39},{"text":"There's a catch overtone in this problem even though the conversations are of other people and have nothing to do with A's activities.","start":825.479,"stop":838.162,"duration":12.68},{"text":"Perhaps most remote is the situation where the bug is put on B unconnected with A.","start":838.162,"stop":847.495,"duration":9.33},{"text":"But A wonders into the picture.","start":847.495,"stop":850.839,"duration":3.34},{"text":"A comes into the room for some purpose, perhaps business, perhaps a social call, perhaps out of curiosity or by mistake.","start":850.839,"stop":862.244,"duration":11.4},{"text":"What may be picked up from A may be relevant but does this mean that the entire record should be made available for A's inspection.","start":862.244,"stop":875.072,"duration":12.83},{"text":"In an underworld atmosphere which is sometimes involved in this cases, there maybe wholly irrelevant things said by other persons which would be very interesting indeed to the person who would not get such information unless there had been illegal activity by representatives of the Government.","start":875.072,"stop":896.409,"duration":21.34},{"text":"Should all of these be made available to A merely because at some point he came in to the sound tracking?","start":896.409,"stop":906.682,"duration":10.27},{"text":"It's bad enough that there was such illegal activity but does the fact there was illegal activity mean that its fruits must be broadcast to the world.","start":906.682,"stop":919.231,"duration":12.55},{"text":"As happened in the (Inaudible) case in Boston last May where the materials became an exhibit in the case to somebody's carelessness, I don't know who, it was not sealed, they were then copied by the press in the clerk's office and reproduced with big headlines by many newspapers.","start":919.231,"stop":943.328,"duration":24.1},{"text":"It said that this can be safeguarded against by proper protective orders in the District Court.","start":943.328,"stop":951.549,"duration":8.22},{"text":"All that I can say is that this has not worked perfectly in practice and I doubt that it will in the future.","start":951.549,"stop":959.855,"duration":8.31},{"text":"In any event, it does not protect third persons from disclosure to the defendant himself.","start":959.855,"stop":966.861,"duration":7.01},{"text":"And that may in some cases be a very serious matter.","start":966.861,"stop":972.106,"duration":5.25},{"text":"Suppose, for example, that in the bugging of A's premises, two of his lieutenants were picked up in his absence discussing how they might displaced it.","start":972.106,"stop":986.48,"duration":14.37},{"text":"Thus, it is important to note that the question of what disclosure the Government makes of conversations which it has overheard, involves more than just a right of a particular defendant before the court.","start":986.48,"stop":1003.312,"duration":16.83},{"text":"It involves the right of each of the participants to the conversation.","start":1003.312,"stop":1008.752,"duration":5.44},{"text":"We believe that the rights of these other participants in overheard conversations and of still other persons to whom reference is made in conversations are also entitled to protection and that the interest these individuals have in keeping the conversations private will often militate against the unnecessary disclosure of the conversations to the defendant.","start":1008.752,"stop":1036.541,"duration":27.79},{"text":"Under the procedure that Mr. Williams proposes, no protection would be given to the interest to these third persons.","start":1036.541,"stop":1044.84,"duration":8.3},{"text":"We submit that by giving the trial judge the discretion to make an in camera examination of the records of the overhearing some degree of protection can be provided to these third parties since records of their conversation would only be disclosed to the defendant if they were arguably relevant to the case at issue.","start":1044.84,"stop":1071.247,"duration":26.41},{"text":"I don't know what the answer is, it is however to coin another phrase, a condition and not of theory that we are confronted with.","start":1071.247,"stop":1084.704,"duration":13.46},{"text":"I have sometimes felt that the answer is that we should gather up all of these records and take them to the place in the treasury where they disposed of worn out paper money and have them all totally destroyed, macerated I think is the term with appropriate witnesses.","start":1084.704,"stop":1107.046,"duration":22.34},{"text":"But we obviously cant do that, indeed in one of the cases now pending before the court, McGarry against the United States number 1184, we are in trouble because something like that did happen.","start":1107.046,"stop":1124.244,"duration":17.2},{"text":"The records there were destroyed, I think without any evil intent but the fact is that they're gone and we don't -- we can't say what was in them.","start":1124.244,"stop":1133.433,"duration":9.19},{"text":"My observation leads me to believe that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been very methodical about all this.","start":1133.433,"stop":1142.503,"duration":9.07},{"text":"Their records have been well and carefully kept.","start":1142.503,"stop":1146.2,"duration":3.7},{"text":"One can find out where a bug is placed and the dates when it was in use.","start":1146.2,"stop":1151.191,"duration":4.99},{"text":"There's an index not merely of the person's bug but a person's mentioned in the interceptive conversations.","start":1151.191,"stop":1159.471,"duration":8.28},{"text":"However, in the case of some other Government agencies, the records are more scanted.","start":1159.471,"stop":1165.55,"duration":6.08},{"text":"Often records have been destroyed and indexing is less than satisfactory.","start":1165.55,"stop":1172.382,"duration":6.83},{"text":"I suppose that with the passage of time, these problems will fade away.","start":1172.382,"stop":1179.183,"duration":6.8},{"text":"But for the time being, they are very troublesome.","start":1179.183,"stop":1184.465,"duration":5.28},{"text":"Finally, I come to another and very important aspect of the question.","start":1184.465,"stop":1191.435,"duration":6.97},{"text":"It's not directly involved in this Kolod case but the order here may affect it and it

Justice cannot pass on its relevance ourselves.","start":1308.661,"stop":1317.503,"duration":8.84},{"text":"We accept that view and agree with it but we think that question of relevance in such cases
