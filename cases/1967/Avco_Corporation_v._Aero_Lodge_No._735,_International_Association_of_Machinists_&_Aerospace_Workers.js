Mills, they said that in enacting Section 301, Congress had preempted, totally preempted the field of breach contract, the contract violation and that therefore our suit necessarily arose under the

the contrary.","start":456.361,"stop":461.114,"duration":4.75},{"text":"Congress intended that these state court remedies would continue to operate and they simply supplemented the existing state court remedies with one more remedy.","start":461.114,"stop":473.722,"duration":12.61},{"text":"Now why did they do that?","start":473.722,"stop":475.326,"duration":1.6},{"text":"They did it because the legislative history shows that Congress was concerned in 1947, with seeing these agreements enforced and they were concerned by evidence in legislative hearings that there were gaps in the law of many states because of the diversity problem and -- the problem are not diversity, but the problem of being unable to sue unions as an additive.","start":475.326,"stop":500.835,"duration":25.51},{"text":"The fact that you had to sue everybody in an unincorporated association and for other reasons there were gaps in the enforcement of

this legislative history.","start":532.383,"stop":538.919,"duration":6.54},{"text":"This Court for example held in Dowd and stated in Dowd that Congress manifested its complete awareness of both the

organizations.","start":582.112,"stop":596.265,"duration":14.15},{"text":"The court stated in Hughes v.
