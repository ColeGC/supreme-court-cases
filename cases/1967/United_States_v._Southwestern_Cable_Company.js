broadcasting.","start":350.324,"stop":367.927,"duration":17.6},{"text":"There was a second factor here and that is even if this local station had been carried, the CATV system was duplicating its programs.","start":367.927,"stop":377.475,"duration":9.55},{"text":"As the Court notes from the case to follow, CATV presently stands outside the competitive TV programming distribution

for these three important reasons.","start":442.614,"stop":447.884,"duration":5.27},{"text":"First, the CATV does not serve the people in the local area.","start":447.884,"stop":453.741,"duration":5.86},{"text":"It cost $3,000 to $4,000 in mile to string cable and as a result, it doesn't go out to the rural areas.","start":453.741,"stop":461.094,"duration":7.35},{"text":"It's confined just to the built up areas in the city.","start":461.094,"stop":464.074,"duration":2.98},{"text":"In Carter Mountain, this meant that of 74,000 people, 40,000 of them would be left without any service and that clearly is not in the public interest, for some people to get service at the expense of those in the rural areas getting none.","start":464.074,"stop":478.046,"duration":13.97},{"text":"Second, CATV is a form of pay TV and there are some people who cannot afford to pay so once again they wouldn't be

service.","start":489.752,"stop":502.173,"duration":12.42},{"text":"Now, to deal with this in view of the trends as phenomenal growth factor, the Commission devised two reasonable rules: the first is

station?","start":1157.527,"stop":1162.218,"duration":4.69},{"text":"Now, the Commission said it would treat this problem when it arose under petition, bringing it to its attention under 1109 and would hold the same evidentiary hearing before the commencement of the service.","start":1162.218,"stop":1173.994,"duration":11.78},{"text":"Now, there is one other facet of 1109 that's applicable here.","start":1173.994,"stop":1177.893,"duration":3.9},{"text":"The Commission grant brought it in all the existing stations, all existing systems, excuse me.","start":1177.893,"stop":1183.494,"duration":5.6},{"text":"But if a system had just gotten under way and had just a few 100 subscribers, it clearly shouldn't grow from these few hundred to

again that when this was brought to its attention under 1109, it would hold the hearing.","start":1200.494,"stop":1207.286,"duration":6.79},{"text":"And since that hearing is a complex economic one that would take considerable time, the Commission also said that it would consider on the pleadings awarding interim relief, holding the status quo because if the systems continue to grow while the hearing was going on, the Commission could be met by entrenchment and the Commission stressed throughout all these rules that once a CATV becomes entrenched, it cannot roll back the service.","start":1207.286,"stop":1232.237,"duration":24.95},{"text":"It cannot let the service get dug in.","start":1232.237,"stop":1234.997,"duration":2.76},{"text":"The people get to rely upon it
