July.","start":267.57,"stop":276.029,"duration":8.46},{"text":"He didn't know apparently that his opponent was ineligible to be a candidate, we assume he would complain about that, the most obvious flaw in that runoff, nor did he complain about the June general election which had produced the tie vote and had made the runoff necessary.","start":276.029,"stop":294.885,"duration":18.86},{"text":"At least he didn't expressly complain about anything except the illegal votes that have been cast at the runoff.","start":294.885,"stop":305.017,"duration":10.13},{"text":"What's more he said that there were nine illegal votes cast at the runoff and he'd lost by some 19 votes.","start":305.017,"stop":312.593,"duration":7.58},{"text":"Therefore the union internal appeal machine denied his protest on the ground that those nine votes couldn't have made any difference.","start":312.593,"stop":322.376,"duration":9.78},{"text":"At this point our defeated candidate for Business Representative a complaint to the Secretary, as he had a right to do having exhausted his internal unit remedy, again he told the Secretary that he was complaining about the casting of illegal ballots.","start":322.376,"stop":345.522,"duration":23.15},{"text":"He said he was complaining about the runoff.","start":345.522,"stop":347.877,"duration":2.36},{"text":"He made reference to protest internally and I think fairly one should say that all he pinpointed was the casting of illegal votes at the runoff.","start":347.877,"stop":360.16,"duration":12.28},{"text":"However when the Secretary investigated he very promptly found that this was not the only illegality, not only had there been illegal votes cast at the runoff, but the same practice had prevailed at the general election a month earlier with a result that illegal votes have been cast there as well and further more illegal candidates had been allowed to run, including our complainants to opponents, including the one who ultimately prevailed for Business Representative.","start":360.16,"stop":398.325,"duration":38.16},{"text":"Now all this was developed by the Secretary within 10 days after the complaint was made to him.","start":398.325,"stop":410.288,"duration":11.96},{"text":"In a very frank and complete statement or confession by the Secretary treasurer who explained his practice that had been going on the in the union in the local for many years before his time and then he'd simply followed it.","start":410.288,"stop":427.973,"duration":17.69},{"text":"And that affidavit in the record makes it clear that the Secretary Treasurer before signing a statement had communicated with the International.","start":427.973,"stop":437.902,"duration":9.93},{"text":"So we have reason to believe the International knew the full facts and not nearly the allegation about nine illegal votes within 10 days after the Secretary had notice.","start":437.902,"stop":451.895,"duration":13.99},{"text":"But in any event the next month the Secretary formally wrote to union advising them precisely as to what irregularities his investigation had turned out and these included illegal votes at both elections, illegal candidates at both elections.","start":451.895,"stop":476.766,"duration":24.87},{"text":"And illegal votes I should add sufficient in number to affect the outcome, not nine, but some 50 or 60 which would or might have affected the outcome of the runoff election for Business Representative.","start":476.766,"stop":496.919,"duration":20.15},{"text":"Now there was a -- in answer to this communication from the Secretary the union took the adamant position that it would not investigate, discuss, talk about anything except the charges made with respect to the runoff.","start":496.919,"stop":514.015,"duration":17.1},{"text":"Nobody talk about the charges made with respect to the runoff expect as it affected illegal votes, it would say nothing about illegal candidates because that was all that had been included in the member's protest when it was made to the union in another time.","start":514.015,"stop":533.761,"duration":19.75},{"text":"There was a fruitless conference between the Secretary and President of the International Union and shortly thereafter the Secretary filed a suit.","start":533.761,"stop":545.459,"duration":11.7},{"text":"Immediately, well, I don't know how soon after the filing of the suit, the union moved to dismiss those portions of the suit which had anything except the runoff in July of 1963 on the ground that as to the general election there had been no internal protest and no exhaustion of internal remedies and therefore the court was without jurisdiction to look into that earlier general election.","start":545.459,"stop":576.061,"duration":30.6},{"text":"Although of course the earlier general election was the immediate cause of the runoff the time of which it produced the runoff.","start":576.061,"stop":586.198,"duration":10.14},{"text":"That motion to dismiss this part of the complaint was sustained by the district judge on the grounds I've indicated.","start":586.198,"stop":598.817,"duration":12.62},{"text":"At this point, the Secretary on the basis of admissions and answers to interrogatories moved for summary judgment with respect to the runoff asking that the court direct at least a rerun of that runoff election for the Office of Business Representative under the supervision of the Secretary since there had been clear violations of the act and since those violations has obviously, might well have affected the outcome of election.","start":598.817,"stop":638.01,"duration":39.19},{"text":"The district judge agreed and did enter that order.","start":638.01,"stop":645.155,"duration":7.14},{"text":"The district judge noticed that there were 58 illegal ballots cast in this runoff which might well have affected the outcome and that it said was reason enough to require a rerun of that particular election.","start":645.155,"stop":665.193,"duration":20.04},{"text":"The district judge also addressed himself to the question whether there had been a violation with respect to illegal candidates running, but found it unnecessary to reach that question and expressed some doubt whether that was before it since that complaint had not been made internally through the union.","start":665.193,"stop":691.157,"duration":25.96},{"text":"By this time although the suit was filed in early 1964 where in April of 1966 the -- in this union elections every three years as opposed to two years as in the prior case and the June 1966 regular elections were impending when the district judge issued his order.","start":691.157,"stop":717.962,"duration":26.8},{"text":"So he provided that at those regular elections the Secretary would supervise that aspect of the election that went to the Office of Business Representative but not the rest of the election for the remaining offices and that those elected then would hold office for the following three years.","start":717.962,"stop":742.017,"duration":24.06},{"text":"This is an effort common in the district courts to avoid an unnecessary disruption of the local union's regular schedules of elections rather than have a man elected for two or three months and then have to rerun the election again, the judge made this sensible accommodation with the no objection from the Secretary.","start":742.017,"stop":768.405,"duration":26.39},{"text":"In June 1966, the regular elections were held, the secretary did supervise that portion of it, which related to Business Representative although not the other portion.","start":768.405,"stop":782.786,"duration":14.38},{"text":"An appeal had been filed by him to the Sixth Circuit, but a day or so thereafter these intervening elections occurred and Sixth Circuit following the Second and in accord with the Third Circuit of the prior case dismissed the Secretary's suit or ordered it dismissed as mooted by this supervening election.","start":782.786,"stop":808.804,"duration":26.02},{"text":"Accordingly, it reached no other issue of the case.","start":808.804,"stop":813.301,"duration":4.5},{"text":"Now here of course as in the prior case, the threshold question is whether the supervening election mooted the Secretary's request for an order directing laboratory election or a supervised election.","start":813.301,"stop":832.462,"duration":19.16},{"text":"I see no occasion to repeat what I said in the prior case on that score.","start":832.462,"stop":839.305,"duration":6.84},{"text":"It seems to us that the reasons there apply fully here and that is true although here we don't know whether in fact there were any irregularities in June 1966 when the supervening election occurred.","start":839.305,"stop":860.404,"duration":21.1},{"text":"But if the remedy of laboratory election is ever important if it ever serves any purpose that purpose, you cannot be defeated by the holding of an unsupervised election.","start":860.404,"stop":874.262,"duration":13.86},{"text":"By definition an unsupervised election will not do service for a supervised elections.","start":874.262,"stop":880.845,"duration":6.58},{"text":"There must be some point in having an laboratory election and that point cannot be defeated,
