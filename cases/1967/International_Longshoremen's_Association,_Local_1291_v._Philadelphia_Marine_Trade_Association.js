happen at some future time, and thereafter, when another dispute unrelated to the first one arose, they held the hearing on an ex parte report of one of the parties, an ex parte report of one of the

for any reason except those specifically outlined in the agreement.","start":381.948,"stop":402.088,"duration":20.14},{"text":"Under this agreement now, they had to be told the day

men are advised by their particular foreman the day before and they appeared.","start":425.919,"stop":431.757,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Now, one of the key provisions involved in this argument is the provision entitled 10(6).","start":431.757,"stop":438.921,"duration":7.16},{"text":"This is the Section 10(6) that Your Honors will find in the record of number 34 on page 7 which provides what they call a “set-back clause” and it simply gives the employer the right to postpone the start of work from 8 o'clock in the morning till 1 o'clock in the afternoon.","start":438.921,"stop":462.868,"duration":23.95},{"text":"And under these circumstances, the men get a one hour guarantee for the morning's work which they missed.","start":462.868,"stop":469.443,"duration":6.57},{"text":"Another provision under this contract is Section 9(h) which provides that when the men are not put to work because of inclement weather, then they must be given the four-hour guarantee for the morning.","start":469.443,"stop":484.884,"duration":15.44},{"text":"The difference here is whether or not the one hour guarantee, the

the men were knocked off or not put to work because of inclement weather.","start":484.884,"stop":507.905,"duration":23.02},{"text":"And then the last provision that I would note to Your Honors' attention in the collective bargaining agreement, is number 28 which relates to the grievance and arbitration machinery and this provides that all disputes and this say, I'm quoting the language now, all disputes of whatever nature or kind must be submitted to arbitration, including the interpretation of the agreement and so on.","start":507.905,"stop":529.885,"duration":21.98},{"text":"It's a very broad clause and all disputes.","start":529.885,"stop":532.884,"duration":3},{"text":"And I may say that under this clause, and under this particular clause and under the practice of the industry, whenever a dispute arose and that was sent to arbitration, if another dispute arose involving even the same issue, the parties did have the right and in fact exercise it and went to the arbitrator again.","start":532.884,"stop":553.265,"duration":20.38},{"text":"There may be some, might be some distinction between the first dispute and the second dispute.","start":553.265,"stop":559.404,"duration":6.14},{"text":"But in any event, both parties always exercise the right to go to the arbitrator as many times as they wanted and I may say that previously, and I cited in my brief, when the Father Comey was the arbitrator on the Philadelphia waterfront, he -- the same issue, I think it was under 14(d), which is so-called -- involving the introduction of the so-called “technological advances” into the waterfront.","start":559.404,"stop":584.938,"duration":25.53},{"text":"Father Comey had ruled on these four occasions that the issue was not arbitrable and on each occassion, he interpreted this Section 14(d) to mean that this was a matter for negotiation of the parties and it was not arbitrable because it was under the provisions of this agreement.","start":584.938,"stop":604.764,"duration":19.83},{"text":"It involved a technological advancement and therefore, it had to be negotiated and not arbitrated.","start":604.764,"stop":609.115,"duration":4.35},{"text":"The fifth time, the same kind of a dispute under the same provision of the agreement came before Father Comey.","start":609.115,"stop":615.47,"duration":6.36},{"text":"He again refuted and said, “Well, it's only human to err” and he reversed himself.","start":615.47,"stop":621.807,"duration":6.34},{"text":"There was some question.","start":621.807,"stop":622.593,"duration":0.79},{"text":"My friend raises the question and says that he

matter.","start":625.389,"stop":628.916,"duration":3.53},{"text":"The point is that he received the same dispute and the same clause and he interpreted the same clause five times.","start":628.916,"stop":636.312,"duration":7.4},{"text":"The first four times uniformly; the fifth time he reversed himself.","start":636.312,"stop":641.059,"duration":4.75},{"text":"The point I want to make is that throughout, even though the same issue was involved, the parties had the right to go to arbitration and that the arbitrator say whether (a) if it is the same dispute; (b) whether he still wants to follow the same decision that has been rendered before on the basis of this particular clause.","start":641.059,"stop":660.785,"duration":19.73}]},{"speakerName":"Potter
