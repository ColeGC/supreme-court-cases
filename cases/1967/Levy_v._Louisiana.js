classification here.","start":348.192,"stop":365.112,"duration":16.92},{"text":"When one turns to the survivorship portion of the statute, the purpose is only slightly different but there is an added

stated in the statute itself and by an authoritative law review article in Louisiana which on page 16 states, \"The idea apparently evolved that the person responsible for the wrongful act should pay
