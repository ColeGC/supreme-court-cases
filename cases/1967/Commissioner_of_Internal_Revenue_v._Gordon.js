Nevada.","start":182.744,"stop":199.54,"duration":16.8},{"text":"Since 1907, more than 80% of the voting stock of Pacific has been held by American Telephone and Telegraph Company.","start":199.54,"stop":210.68,"duration":11.14},{"text":"And in 1961, which is the year and the only year before the Court, AT&T owned about 90% of Pacific's common stock, about 78% of Pacific's preferred stock, and had nearly 90% of the voting power in Pacific.","start":210.68,"stop":234.306,"duration":23.63},{"text":"During the late 1950s and in 1960, Pacific in the process of evolving its management of this great enterprise developed a plan to decentralize its operations by separating out its business in Oregon, Washington and Idaho.","start":234.306,"stop":259.159,"duration":24.85},{"text":"It organized a new corporation called Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company and which we refer to as Northwest in this case.","start":259.159,"stop":273.293,"duration":14.13},{"text":"In creating a new corporation, it transferred a small amount of cash to Northwest for stock and then it transferred all of its assets

exists as a complete operating corporation wholly owned by Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company.","start":294.884,"stop":311.682,"duration":16.8},{"text":"If Pacific had then distributed all of the Northwest stock and securities to its shareholders, there would have been no doubt that this was a spin-off and that no gain or loss would be recognized.","start":311.682,"stop":328.576,"duration":16.89},{"text":"Indeed, the same result would have happened, subject to certain conditions, if Pacific had distributed at least 80% of the Northwest stock to the Pacific shareholders.","start":328.576,"stop":341.924,"duration":13.35},{"text":"This would have been a spin-off and thus within the terms of the statute, making the distribution tax free.","start":341.924,"stop":350.911,"duration":8.99},{"text":"However, Pacific chose not to proceed in this way and that's why the problem arises here.","start":350.911,"stop":361.387,"duration":10.48},{"text":"Instead of distributing all of the stock or at least 80% of it, Pacific chose to issue warrants or rights to its shareholders in 1961 through which they or persons who purchased their rights could buy not all or 80% but 57% of the Northwest stock.","start":361.387,"stop":392.151,"duration":30.76},{"text":"Under the rights offer, it took six rights and $16 to acquire a share of Northwest stock and $16 was less than the market value of the Northwest stock so that the rights had value.","start":392.151,"stop":411.096,"duration":18.94},{"text":"At the time when these rights were issued, Pacific had what it denominated a plan in which it was stated that Pacific expected to dispose of the rest of the stock through further issues of rights, the time and prices to be determined later.","start":411.096,"stop":433.762,"duration":22.67},{"text":"However, Pacific was under no obligation to make such a disposition.","start":433.762,"stop":440.556,"duration":6.79},{"text":"It did in fact issue further rights in 1963, 21 months later.","start":440.556,"stop":450.401,"duration":9.85},{"text":"As a result, all of the Northwest stock was eventually disposed of either to the Pacific shareholders at the two separated points of time or to the persons to whom such shareholders sold their rights.","start":450.401,"stop":472.217,"duration":21.82},{"text":"In the first of the cases before the Court, the Gordon case number 760, the shareholder received rights in 1962 and exercised them.","start":472.217,"stop":485.794,"duration":13.58},{"text":"The question is whether he had income from this transaction.","start":485.794,"stop":492.273,"duration":6.48},{"text":"In the other case before the Court, the Bann case, number 781, the shareholder exercised all of his rights but four.","start":492.273,"stop":503.051,"duration":10.78},{"text":"As I've said, it took six rights plus $16 to subscribe to a share of Northwest stock.","start":503.051,"stop":511.322,"duration":8.27},{"text":"Mr. Bann exercised all of his rights that he could to get full shares, but he had four leftover, and he sold those four.","start":511.322,"stop":523.094,"duration":11.77},{"text":"The question in the Bann case with respect to the receipt and the exercise of the rights is the same as that in the Gordon case.","start":523.094,"stop":533.036,"duration":9.94},{"text":"In the Bann case however, there is the additional question as to the tax liability arising with respect to the four rights which were not exercised but were sold.","start":533.036,"stop":546.683,"duration":13.65},{"text":"At the time the transaction was under consideration, counsel for Pacific submitted the question to the Internal Revenue Service for a ruling and that ruling is set out in full at page 146 of the record dated June 28, 1961 just before the transfer occurred.","start":546.683,"stop":576.786,"duration":30.1},{"text":"The service rule that the transaction did not fall within Section 355 and that the shareholders would be taxable.","start":576.786,"stop":586.483,"duration":9.7},{"text":"Of course that ruling isn't binding on the Court.","start":586.483,"stop":590.329,"duration":3.85},{"text":"I mention it however to show the position of those charged with administering the tax laws and to show further that Pacific and its shareholders were not taken by surprise and that there would be nothing unfair if it should eventually be concluded that the treasury's contemporaneous ruling was correct.","start":590.329,"stop":617.637,"duration":27.31},{"text":"After the transaction was carried out and returns for 1961 had been filed, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined deficiencies against the two taxpayers now before the Court, who, as I have indicated, had received and exercised rights, but had not included anything in their tax returns with respect to the transaction.","start":617.637,"stop":646.366,"duration":28.73},{"text":"The taxpayers filed petition for review with the Tax Court.","start":646.366,"stop":652.119,"duration":5.75},{"text":"In a careful opinion by Judge Raum, the taxpayers prevailed there.","start":652.119,"stop":658.986,"duration":6.87},{"text":"Judge Raum held that since a distribution of the Northwest shares to the Pacific shareholders without payment would have been tax-free.","start":658.986,"stop":669.943,"duration":10.96},{"text":"It could not be supposed that Congress intended a tax liability to result from a lesser distribution, that is an offer to dispose of the shares at a price through rights as the transaction was actually carried out.","start":669.943,"stop":691.092,"duration":21.15},{"text":"From the decision of the Tax Court, two separate appeals were taken; one to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the Gordon case and the other to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the Bann case.","start":691.092,"stop":710.235,"duration":19.14},{"text":"The Second Circuit decided in favor of the taxpayer in a two-to-one decision with Judge Friendly dissenting.","start":710.235,"stop":719.758,"duration":9.52},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit decided in favor of the Commissioner.","start":719.758,"stop":725.373,"duration":5.62},{"text":"Thus, there was a square conflict of decisions.","start":725.373,"stop":730.45,"duration":5.08},{"text":"Both sides filed petitions for certiorari and these are the cases.","start":730.45,"stop":737.561,"duration":7.11},{"text":"Both arise on the same record which are now before the Court.","start":737.561,"stop":746.342,"duration":8.78},{"text":"Before going further, I would like to point out that this case arises in the same basic area as was involved in the famous Gregory case in 293 U.S. decided in 1935, I suppose all tax lawyers would agree one of the great landmarks in the tax law.","start":746.342,"stop":772.153,"duration":25.81},{"text":"The Gregory case involved a spin-off.","start":772.153,"stop":776.868,"duration":4.72},{"text":"At that time, this was an area which had come to be used very widely for rather blatant tax avoidance which was the situation in the Gregory case itself.","start":776.868,"stop":789.62,"duration":12.75},{"text":"As a result, not only was the Gregory decision announced from this Court, but Congress repealed the provisions which had been included in the earlier revenue laws granting tax-free status to spin-offs.","start":789.62,"stop":805.436,"duration":15.82},{"text":"And there was no provision for tax-free status of spin-offs between 1934 and 1951, a period of 17 years.","start":805.436,"stop":817.272,"duration":11.84},{"text":"Now, let me make it plain that in this case, there's no doubt that there was a substantial and legitimate business purpose and for the steps which Pacific took with respect to its Northwest operations.","start":817.272,"stop":832.292,"duration":15.02},{"text":"The reference to the Gregory case however does seem to me to be relevant because it shows that Congress knew that this was a delicate area with substantial tax avoidance potential.","start":832.292,"stop":848.755,"duration":16.46},{"text":"As a result, when Congress first restored a tax-free status to some spin-offs in 1951, it included careful restrictions.","start":848.755,"stop":863.776,"duration":15.02},{"text":"These restrictions were extended and amplified in the 1954 Code, Section 355 which is now before the Court.","start":863.776,"stop":876.386,"duration":12.61},{"text":"In the light of the background of the spin-off provisions and the language which Congress actually used, it is our position that Congress contemplated that the language of the statute would be carefully read, that its requirements would have to be met, and that it could not be given a broad and sweeping construction.","start":876.386,"stop":903.52,"duration":27.13},{"text":"The statutory provision involved here is the same sort of provision as that relating to collapsible corporations, which was involved in Braunstein against the Commissioner in 374 U.S. where the Court referred to the statute there as setting up “a carefully and elaborately defined category of transactions”.","start":903.52,"stop":932.688,"duration":29.17},{"text":"We have such a provision here.","start":932.688,"stop":936.612,"duration":3.92},{"text":"Let us turn then to the statute itself.","start":936.612,"stop":942.369,"duration":5.76},{"text":"As I've said at the opening of the argument, this is a technical tax case.","start":942.369,"stop":948.27,"duration":5.9},{"text":"Much of the technicality is developed in the main briefs and the reply briefs which have been filed by both of the parties.","start":948.27,"stop":957.338,"duration":9.07},{"text":"I'm going to try to keep my argument relatively simple focusing attention on three provisions of the statute.","start":957.338,"stop":966.3,"duration":8.96},{"text":"If more detail is wanted, it will be found in ample amounts in the briefs which have been prepared for the Court.","start":966.3,"stop":976.358,"duration":10.06},{"text":"The full text of Section 355 appears at several places in the papers before the Court.","start":976.358,"stop":985.041,"duration":8.68},{"text":"The place to which I shall refer is in the appendix to the government's main brief, the usual gray-covered brief, beginning at page 53 of that brief.","start":985.041,"stop":999.639,"duration":14.6},{"text":"Section 355 is a part of subchapter (c) in the Internal Revenue Code relating to corporate distributions and reorganizations.","start":999.639,"stop":1012.292,"duration":12.65},{"text":"It follows Section 351 which deals with transfers to a controlled corporation and Section 354 which deals with exchanges in connection with a reorganization.","start":1012.292,"stop":1031.829,"duration":19.54},{"text":"Section 355 is itself entitled distribution of stock and securities of a controlled corporation.","start":1031.829,"stop":1043.226,"duration":11.4},{"text":"As you will see, it's a long provision occupying nearly all of four pages in the brief.","start":1043.226,"stop":1053.366,"duration":10.14},{"text":"Generally speaking though, we need be concerned only with that portion of the statute which appears on page 53 and the top of page 54, that is a total of one and a half out of the entire four pages.","start":1053.366,"stop":1073.435,"duration":20.07},{"text":"The rest of the provision is important as a part of the setting of the statute since it illustrates the care with which Congress drew the provision and its apparent concern that its term should be specific and carefully safeguarded.","start":1073.435,"stop":1093.677,"duration":20.24},{"text":"Let us then look at paragraph (a) (1) of Section 355 as it begins on page 53 of the government's
