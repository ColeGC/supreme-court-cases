inconsistent with the abstract statement where they said that the school board may not be required to make compulsory assignments to achieve a greater intermixture of the races, or as is otherwise stated by the majority below, that the constitution does not require that he, the individual pupil, be deprived of his choice freely expressed.","start":391.975,"stop":418.604,"duration":26.63},{"text":"In sharp contrast with this holding, Judges Sobbeloff and Winter emphasized what we think the true constitutional imperative in this case is.","start":418.604,"stop":427.266,"duration":8.66},{"text":"And that is the freedom of choice is not the sacred talisman, it is only a means to a constitutionally required in the abolition of the system of segregation and its effects.","start":427.266,"stop":440.028,"duration":12.76},{"text":"Using as nearly as channeling which suggested by the respondents, we would state the issue here as in these words.","start":440.028,"stop":446.666,"duration":6.64},{"text":"The county school board of New Kent County, Virginia has a constitutional duty immediately to assign children to each of the public schools so that children of all races will attend schools indiscriminately.","start":446.666,"stop":460.586,"duration":13.92},{"text":"And in support of that, we argue two propositions, the Brown contemplated that this school system would long since have been converted into a unitary non-racial system.","start":460.586,"stop":469.988,"duration":9.4},{"text":"And second, the freedom of

existing segregate system to a system not based on colored distinctions.","start":527.444,"stop":550.796,"duration":23.35},{"text":"Under respondents argue in their brief that the quandary that was

future.","start":550.796,"stop":564.773,"duration":13.98},{"text":"We do not so read the questions but in any event, this Court's 1955 resolution of its question number four said nothing about the choice of any individual.","start":564.773,"stop":574.467,"duration":9.69},{"text":"On the contrary, the Court directed that there be among other things, revision of school districts and attendance areas therein into compact units to achieve the system of determining admission to the public schools on a non-racial basis.","start":574.467,"stop":588.977,"duration":14.51},{"text":"It was obvious that such revision in large and complex school districts would require more time than would be required for a simple school district like New Kent County with two separate and equal schools.","start":588.977,"stop":600.034,"duration":11.06},{"text":"Hence the court charged the District Courts to allow time when necessary, but the lower courts would ere to be bear in mind that the burden rests upon the defendants to establish that such time is necessary in the public interest in consistent with good faith compliance at the earliest practical date.","start":600.034,"stop":614.913,"duration":14.88},{"text":"In New Kent County with two schools, it would be a simple matter to assign all children in the western part of the county to Watkins School, and all of the children in the eastern part of the county to New Kent School.","start":614.913,"stop":625.321,"duration":10.41},{"text":"Or one school could've been made the elementary school and one school could've been made the high school.","start":625.321,"stop":630.991,"duration":5.67},{"text":"Either these could've been done overnight and but for Virginia's infamous massive resistance, we say that the earliest practical date for compliance in New Kent County was the first day of school in the 1955.","start":630.991,"stop":646.764,"duration":15.77},{"text":"The respondents do not suggest in their brief or in any stage in these proceedings that there are or ever have been obstacles of administrative character to justify delay in making the transition.","start":646.764,"stop":657.578,"duration":10.81},{"text":"On the contrary, they have deliberately selected the only available alternative, composite though it may be, by which segregation might continue.","start":657.578,"stop":667.349,"duration":9.77},{"text":"This they admit where on pages 3 and 4 of their brief they say that their adoption of freedom of choice was designed to honor the educational imperative of the system.","start":667.349,"stop":677.28,"duration":9.93},{"text":"By that they meaning, that if they should desegregate both schools that white patrons would withdraw their children form the schools, from the public schools.","start":677.28,"stop":686.319,"duration":9.04},{"text":"I think this suggestion was answered by the Court in 1955 when it said that it should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles should not be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them.","start":686.319,"stop":699.108,"duration":12.79},{"text":"We think the answer was reaffirmed in 1958 when this Court considered the Liberrock case, Cooper versus Errand.","start":699.108,"stop":705.081,"duration":5.97},{"text":"We think the same answer was reaffirmed in 1964 in the Prince Ebert County, Virginia case and we submit that on January 15, 1968 when this Court affirmed the tuition grant case from Louisiana that that was another answer -- sufficient answer to that threat or the possible to white persons might withdraw their children from the public schools.","start":705.081,"stop":727.316,"duration":22.24},{"text":"We submit that in New Kent County, compliance with the Brown mandate is long overdue that the time for deliberate speed has

adopted.","start":736.681,"stop":741.236,"duration":4.55},{"text":"It's just another expedient to avoid compliance with Brown mandate.","start":741.236,"stop":745.968,"duration":4.73},{"text":"If a
