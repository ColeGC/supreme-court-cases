submission, the excise tax is invalid whatever maybe the disposition of Kahriger and Lewis in the occupational tax because of our reading in Kahriger and Lewis is turning on the fact that the

perspective nature of the occupational tax was the basis of Kahriger but I understand Mr. Beytagh arguing for the United States a few moments ago, to say that the United States does not rest on that as a justification of Kahriger-Lewis cases and he puts the argument now as -- as an understanding on the thought which is voiced primarily in Lewis case of the voluntary nature of the testimony which is required that since the person may get out of the gambling business.","start":129.782,"stop":169.52,"duration":39.74},{"text":"He is under no compulsion to gamble, therefore under no compulsion to pay tax on gambling.","start":169.52,"stop":174.963,"duration":5.44},{"text":"Now, this line of argument of course, would apply as much to the excise tax as it does to the occupational tax and I've -- we'll get back and -- and comment on that in a moment but at the outset, I would like to address myself to a question which the Chief Justice put yesterday afternoon to Mr. Zeldes in which he inquired about a hypothetical federal tax on bucket shops whether that would raise the same problems as are involved here.","start":174.963,"stop":205.666,"duration":30.7},{"text":"It seems to me that the Chief Justice's question was susceptible of two readings.","start":205.666,"stop":211.006,"duration":5.34},{"text":"If the tax, the Chief Justice had in mind was a tax specifically on the occupation of running a bucket shop then my answer would be the same as Mr. Zeldes gave.","start":211.006,"stop":222.041,"duration":11.03},{"text":"I would find it quiet indistinguishable from the taxes we have here.","start":222.041,"stop":225.366,"duration":3.33},{"text":"But I think that perhaps what the Chief Justice had in mind was a different kind of tax.","start":225.366,"stop":230.177,"duration":4.81},{"text":"A Federal Tax, let us say, when every person engaged in the securities business and someone so engaged refuses to pay up because he is in fact running a bucket shop and the form saying that he is in the securities business might be a link in the chain of evidence that would convict him.","start":230.177,"stop":250.07,"duration":19.89},{"text":"I think that the -- if -- if that is the question the Chief Justice intended, it raises extremely important and interesting problems as to the basic theory of the privilege against self-incrimination and specifically, what kinds of compelled testimony are incriminating.","start":250.07,"stop":271.046,"duration":20.98},{"text":"Now, the test announced by this Court in the Hoffman case and that quoted many times since has been linked in a chain.","start":271.046,"stop":278.84,"duration":7.79},{"text":"But I'm perfectly confident, but the courts never supposed that an important and settled constitutional principle can be expressed in a forcible phrase.","start":278.84,"stop":292.224,"duration":13.38},{"text":"If one goes back to Hoffman itself, though the link in the chain language is used.","start":292.224,"stop":297.606,"duration":5.38},{"text":"The Court also speaks of working to the implications of the question, the setting in which it is asked, the background and the peculiarities of the case.","start":297.606,"stop":307.441,"duration":9.83},{"text":"I cannot believe that the Fifth Amendment extends protection to any statement which might be admissible in evidence in a criminal prosecution.","start":307.441,"stop":322.225,"duration":14.78},{"text":"I think that, if link in the chain is given with that broad a reading that there is the same difficulty that Professor Henry had observed of the outcome determined of test to guarantee trust that there is no logical stopping place.","start":322.225,"stop":337.931,"duration":15.71},{"text":"There is virtually nothing that a person could not refuse to answer on the ground that it is incriminating.","start":337.931,"stop":345.376,"duration":7.44},{"text":"I'm personally aware of the case in the Utah state court, some five years ago in which a person claimed the privilege when he was asked whether he was plaintiff with Erwin N. Griswold.","start":345.376,"stop":355.516,"duration":10.14},{"text":"And my mind boggles that the notion could be possibly be incriminating to be acquainted with Griswold.","start":355.516,"stop":361.77,"duration":6.25},{"text":"And I think that here the key is, to look as Hoffman says and I think Albertson now develops the theory further to look at the point at which the inquiry is made, the circumstances in which it is made.","start":361.77,"stop":378.884,"duration":17.11},{"text":"I think that this is the reason why the government concedes that the Sullivan case does not control here.","start":378.884,"stop":386.66,"duration":7.78},{"text":"It is true that one reporting income tax conceivably could report something which would be admissible in evidence in a later case.","start":386.66,"stop":395.231,"duration":8.57},{"text":"Income tax returns have come in and in some kinds of litigation.","start":395.231,"stop":399.31,"duration":4.08},{"text":"But as we said in -- in Albertson, the questions are neutral in there face and they're directed to the public at large.","start":399.31,"stop":405.574,"duration":6.26},{"text":"The risk of incrimination is here a minimal risk.","start":405.574,"stop":409.506,"duration":3.93},{"text":"We go to the other extreme, you have a person who has been subpoenaed to appear before some investigative body and here a question which addressed to the world generally might be neutral and non-incriminating because of the setting takes on a much more sinister cast.","start":409.506,"stop":427.355,"duration":17.85},{"text":"And in my submission, what the Fifth Amendment really protects is against a person being compelled to give any testimony which will have a substantial effect of accusing himself of the crime.","start":427.355,"stop":442.167,"duration":14.81},{"text":"Now on that analysis, I return to the bucket shop case which provoked it.","start":442.167,"stop":448.851,"duration":6.68},{"text":"If the Federal Tax in question whereas I understood the Chief Justice to suggest a general tax then I would say that there would not be a constitutional privilege.","start":448.851,"stop":458.116,"duration":9.26},{"text":"That the likelihood of incrimination and asking people to say that I am engaged in the securities business is very small and that even for the bucket shop operator, this would be such a very small part of the case against him.","start":458.116,"stop":473.18,"duration":15.06},{"text":"The government's case would require much more than that and this I think would really be insignificant.","start":473.18,"stop":479.414,"duration":6.23},{"text":"I deal in the same way with the example that the United States puts in its brief, can a person refuse to pay real estate taxes because of the property which he owns is being used for purposes of prostitution.","start":479.414,"stop":496.997,"duration":17.58},{"text":"And as the government points out, if you have a person who is himself being charged with prostitution and he's asked, “Do you own this property?” Then you have I think a very substantial link in the chain.","start":496.997,"stop":509.426,"duration":12.43},{"text":"But if you simply ask the whole world to come forward and pay real estate taxes on the property they own, I think that you come again on the language of Albertson, the requirement is neutral on its face and directed at the public at large.","start":509.426,"stop":523.777,"duration":14.35}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Well Professor Wright, do you properly concede the purpose of my question and the reason I asked the question was because Mr. Zeldes had said this case is no different from a statute that would require burglars to register.","start":523.777,"stop":543.959,"duration":20.18},{"text":"And I wanted to differentiate between a burglary statute and one of this kind.","start":543.959,"stop":550.892,"duration":6.93},{"text":"Now it seems to me that the difference between the two is this, that -- and nobody recognizes burglary as being lawful under any circumstances.","start":550.892,"stop":566.43,"duration":15.54},{"text":"On the other hand, gambling can be legal or it can be illegal.","start":566.43,"stop":573.254,"duration":6.82},{"text":"In some states, gambling is legal and in some states -- one state at least, practically all gambling is legal but others permit the bingo game and other things that the -- that the start -- start in small campus but eventually developed into a very big gambling industries.","start":573.254,"stop":597.287,"duration":24.03},{"text":"Some gambling, the United States is interested in because it engages in commerce and as to that has a vital interest.","start":597.287,"stop":610.369,"duration":13.08},{"text":"So taking it by and large, it seems to me that gambling is one of those -- one of those industries that can be legal or can be illegal but its been recognized as a kind of business that where it is made legal even, it can be regulated to the extent of extinction.","start":610.369,"stop":635.625,"duration":25.26},{"text":"And I think that has been recognized in the law for a long time.","start":635.625,"stop":641.486,"duration":5.86},{"text":"Now, if that is true and if it can be recognized that the government has great difficulty in collecting taxes from ordinary taxes from the gambling interest because of the surreptitious ways and the way they do business.","start":641.486,"stop":662.869,"duration":21.38},{"text":"Is there any reason why the government cannot have special statutes directed to an industry of that kind?","start":662.869,"stop":674.404,"duration":11.53},{"text":"It seems to me that's a very much the same as the securities business.","start":674.404,"stop":680.382,"duration":5.98},{"text":"For instance, there are some people who don't deal in anything legal when they sell security.","start":680.382,"stop":687.545,"duration":7.16},{"text":"They just set up a bucket shop and a -- and a teleformic way of doing business and operate for a while and get out of it.","start":687.545,"stop":698.351,"duration":10.81},{"text":"There are others of course, that are fairly legal and some people who normally are legal cheat on it.","start":698.351,"stop":706.657,"duration":8.31},{"text":"And I think in those circumstances, perhaps the government could be entitled to have a registration statute for -- for all security dealers and so I just ask a question if there is a similarity between that kind of an industry and the gambling industry?","start":706.657,"stop":731.354,"duration":24.7}]},{"speakerName":"Charles Alan Wright","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, in my submission, the gambling business is much more like the
