And that makes them uniquely different than a common law beneficiary who actually has an equitable ownership interest in the trust property. Under common law traditions, the trustee holds the legal title to the asset but only for the benefit of those persons who are named as beneficiaries. And those beneficiaries have equitable rights in the property that's legally nominally in the name of the trustee. Here the shareholder members, as we describe them, only have an interest in the personal property of a certificate of ownership, very much like the limited partners in Carden.

And I'll tell you why that's important: Because that is consonant with the rule announced by this Court in Chapman, Great Southern, Bouligny, and Carden. Chapman v. Barney, the doctrinal wall case, those persons that were deemed to be members were the persons that were the stock owners of the joint stock company under New York law. In Great Southern, again a limited partnership case, were those persons that had an economic interest in the entity. And the same rule applied in Carden. If we are to adopt Americold's position in this case and now suggest that the board of trustees that do not have an economic ownership interest in the entity itself controls, we're going to open the floodgates of uncertainty for the under -- for the lower courts.
