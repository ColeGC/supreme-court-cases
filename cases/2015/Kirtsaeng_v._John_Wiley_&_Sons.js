Looking at hundreds and hundreds of cases in the Second Circuit, in the district courts, I think that there is a lot of discretion that one can exercise in deciding whether to include cases in your count or not include cases in your count, whether you include default judgments, whether you include declaratory judgment situations, whether you include situations where the Court says as a technical matter, you can't get fees because your motion was late.","start":2560.36,"stop":2596.035,"duration":35.67},{"text":"But in the alternative, if I were to consider it, I would go on to award or not award you fees, anyway.

But if you drop out those default judgments, which, as Mr. Smith indicated, are situations where the fee motion is effectively unopposed, where I think the defendant often looks very unreasonable by not having shown up to defend the case, and where the fee amount is quite small by necessity because not much has happened in the case, then the numbers start to look more similar, 59.7 percent for plaintiffs, 53 percent for defendants.
