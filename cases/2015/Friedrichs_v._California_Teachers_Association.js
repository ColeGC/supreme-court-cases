Verrilli, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin by summarizing the three fundamental reasons why Abood should be reaffirmed. First, in the four decades that Abood has been the law, this Court's jurisprudence in the area of -- of employment relations, First Amendment jurisprudence in the area of employment relations has converged with Abood in a way that fortifies its foundations and does not erode them, because what those cases have recognized is when the government is acting as employer managing the workforce, it should receive reasonableness review in order to give it the latitude comparable to that of a private employer to manage its workforce, and not exacting scrutiny that applies when government is a sovereign regulating the citizens. Second, in those four decades, more than 20 States have enacted and enforced laws that allow the public employers in those States to have the same latitude that Congress gave private employers to decide, based on workplace needs and local conditions, whether agency fee requirements will help them achieve the purposes for which they -- for which they adopt collective bargaining. And the reliance goes far deeper than those 20 State laws and the thousands of contracts affecting millions of people that are based on those laws.","start":4095.195,"stop":4171.44,"duration":76.24},{"text":"In those States, the agency fee requirement has worked its way, woven its way into the fabric of the relation between workers and management and the public's fear. In those States, the unions have taken on such obligations as training and the like, funded by agency fees that make the workplace more effective for management, as well as more effective for employees. And if you were to take those away, you're going to disrupt those long-term relationships that have developed over time, and the expectations that have developed over time, and you're going to replace them with a different kind of a situation in which the union is going to have a different set of incentives, trying to -- trying to ensure that the maximum number of people are willing to pay union fees. And the way that the unions are likely to try to do that is through trying to convince employees that you -- that they need the union because otherwise management is going to do them harm.","start":4171.44,"stop":4225.645,"duration":54.21},{"text":"And I do think that that's a significant problem here for public employer perspective now, in a time of budgetary constraints, when difficult decisions have to be made and cuts have to be made.
