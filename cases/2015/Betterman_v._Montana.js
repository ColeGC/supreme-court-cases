And this gets to another point that the United States made, and that is that -- that the conviction changes everything, because the concerns that the court articulated in Barker may be yet more significant at the sentencing stage, given that most convictions today result from guilty pleas. And so the fact that a defendant -- their defense may be impaired by a delay in criminal proceedings, may be more significant at the sentencing stage because it may be the only place where the defendant challenges an upward adjustment or contests facts. The fact that the defendant may need to access rehabilitation programs may be more pronounced at sentencing because the defendant's already been convicted, they're going to serve time, and they want to get access to the programs that they'll need to get parole as soon as -- as possible.
