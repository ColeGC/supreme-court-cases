And the effect of Petitioner's position, I think we all agree, is that it would not -- the modified categorical approach would not reach burglary in -- in most States; that the ACCA would have a very limited application at best under Petitioner's approach. And of course, you know the modified categorical approach is used in so many different areas, and so these problems with parsing State law, et cetera, would just be multiplied through all of the other different statutes in which the Court has used the modified categorical approach.
