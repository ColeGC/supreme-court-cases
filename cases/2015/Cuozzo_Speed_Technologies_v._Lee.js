Consistent with history, Congress left to the judiciary to determine construction standards, and therefore, in the American Invents Act, there is no explicit statutory language directing the Patent and Trademark Office to use any particular standard of claim construction. But this Court should reverse, as a matter of statutory construction, for four reasons.","start":8.09,"stop":54.755,"duration":46.67},{"text":"First, in summary, all agree that the broadest-reasonable-interpretation expedient demands a broad ability to amend claims, and that's so because the broadest reasonable interpretation brings into play a broader array of prior art that may be distinguishable if the claims were given their actual interpretation.

But that in no way suggests that the Congress, in enacting inter partes review, was suggesting that there be a different claim-construction standard that are used in the district courts when inter partes review was to be a substitute for district court litigation. If I may Your Honors, I'd like to delve into the question that Justice Sotomayor asked about the amendment process.

That is diametrically different to the system that Congress established in inter partes review, as the Patent and Trademark Office represented to the district court.
