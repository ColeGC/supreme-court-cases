The Federal Circuit has done that by moving away from historical practice in two key ways. First, it's made the test all about recklessness rather than also intent. Second, it judges recklessness based on legal defenses developed in litigation rather than the facts at the time of the infringement. The net result, now that this Court in Octane and Highmark set aside a similarly artificial test for fees is a one-of-its-kind, good for patent-damages-only framework that does not track the enhancement statute's text, history, or purposes. It was not always this way.","start":14.16,"stop":66.065,"duration":51.91},{"text":"For nearly 150 years, district courts conducted a totality inquiry subject to deferential review.","start":66.065,"stop":72.51,"duration":6.45},{"text":"And as part of that, they said the nature of the infringement has to be more than negligent if it's going to be an aggravating factor that counsels in favor of an enhancement.
