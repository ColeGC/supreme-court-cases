In the Irwin case, this Court specifically cross-referenced American Pipe as an example of a defective pleading that could satisfy equitable tolling. American Pipe obviously being a class-action tolling rule. We read that cross-reference as a suggestion that, under the right circumstances, if somebody reasonably relies on class-action tolling facts that ultimately prove to be ineffective, that that individual has the ability to ask the Court to find that equitable tolling should apply. If there is such a case, the facts of this case really should satisfy this test. The test is set forth in the Holland case. Due diligence and extraordinary circumstances are the two prongs that have to be satisfied.","start":23.83,"stop":89.985,"duration":66.16},{"text":"Both of them are well-satisfied in this case.
