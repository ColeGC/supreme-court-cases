This Court's precedents made clear that the practical effects on which Respondents rely are not a sufficient ground for treating an agency communication as final agency action. Now, the Respondents primarily emphasize the practical impact that the Corps' jurisdictional determination would have upon themselves, the recipients and the intended audience.","start":32.9,"stop":62.79,"duration":29.89},{"text":"And they say the jurisdictional determination indicating that the Corps believes there are waters of the United States on the Property will force them to choose among three unattractive options: One, would be seeking a permit which could be an expensive process and wouldn't be by any means certain to succeed; the second would be discharging pollutants, discharging fill onto the Property and taking their chances in a future enforcement action; and the third would be playing it safe, forgoing development entirely. And the problem with Respondents' argument is that that choice would have existed before the jurisdictional determination was issued.","start":62.79,"stop":102.325,"duration":39.54},{"text":"It would have existed if the Corps had never adopted its practice of issuing jurisdictional determinations upon request.
