Prelogar","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted Section 117 in response to the epidemic of domestic violence in Indian Country. The Ninth Circuit was wrong to strike down the statute as applied to offenders like Respondent who have abused and battered their intimate partners again and again, but whose tribal-court misdemeanor convictions were uncounseled and resulted in a sentence of imprisonment. The Ninth Circuit's constitutional analysis disconnects the validity of the underlying prior conviction from the permissibility of relying on those convictions to prove the defendant's recidivist status if he commits additional criminal conduct.","start":7.315,"stop":46.64,"duration":39.33},{"text":"And that runs counter to this Court's precedence. In Nichols v. United States, this Court held that a conviction that was uncounseled but was valid at the time it was obtained remains valid when it's used in a subsequent prosecution to classify the defendant as a recidivist.","start":46.64,"stop":63.1,"duration":16.46},{"text":"As I understand the Court's logic in that opinion, the rationale was that in the absence of an actual Sixth Amendment violation in the underlying proceeding, there's no proceeding in which the defendant had but was denied a right to counsel.

But I don't think that makes sense as a matter of the logic under this Court's decision in -- in Nichols, nor do I think it makes sense as a matter of practical reality. Here, for example, Respondent says that if only his Tribal Court had sentenced him to a fine rather than to imprisonment, there would be no constitutional infirmity with relying on those convictions in his Section 117 prosecution. But I can't fathom why it is that the Tribal Court's sentencing determination would make any difference with respect to the validity of those convictions or the permissibility of using them to identify the defendant as among those class of individuals who are properly --","start":120.625,"stop":166.89,"duration":46.26}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony M.

And I don't think that the placement, whether in a sentencing enhancement or -- or as an element of a crime, should make any difference with respect to the purpose to which that conviction is being put.
