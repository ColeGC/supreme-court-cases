In reviewing the Fifth Circuit's initial decision in what we call Fisher I, seven members of this Court reaffirmed that a clear precondition to the use of race as an admissions factor was the ability to satisfy what was called the \"demanding burden of strict scrutiny\" articulated in Grutter and Bakke. By establishing that she was considered for admission to UT under a system that discriminated against her on the basis of her race, Ms. Fisher placed upon UT the burden of -- of proving, by evidence of record, that its use of race was, first, in pursuit of a compelling, constitutionally legitimate interest expressed with sufficient clarity and concreteness to allow a reviewing court to determine, first, that the use of race was a necessary last resort in pursuing the interest defined, taking into account reasonably available nonracial alternatives.","start":26.595,"stop":100.12,"duration":73.53}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Rein, may I ask, if we didn't have the 10 percent plan, if that were out of this case, and all that were left were the Grutter-like plan, would you then recognize that you had no claim?
