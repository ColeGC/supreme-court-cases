That was mistaken for two basic reasons. First, special counsel are State officers under that Act.","start":40.76,"stop":67.76,"duration":27},{"text":"And so they fall within the government exemption designed to protect government operations. And, second, special counsel's use of attorney general letterhead accurately conveyed their relationship to the office and furthered the purposes of the Act by putting the credibility of the office on the line and giving it a powerful incentive to monitor special counsel when they collect these debts. So I would like to begin first with the first question presented, the officer question.","start":67.76,"stop":96.155,"duration":28.39},{"text":"And the briefs have gone back and forth on what officer can mean historically and on what it should mean for the Act.","start":96.155,"stop":103.54,"duration":7.39},{"text":"I think -- I think what it should mean for the Act is -- is that the broadest conceivable definition should apply, precisely because this provision is designed to protect government operations.","start":103.54,"stop":114.625,"duration":11.08}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"May I ask you about the -- the general structure of the Act seems to be in-house collectors are okay, but outside collectors, whether for private or for government, fall under the Act.
