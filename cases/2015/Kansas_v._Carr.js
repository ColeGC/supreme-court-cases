And to give an example of that -- I mean, I think the example the Court suggests in Zafiro of that is where there is aggravating evidence that pertains only to one defendant, but that that aggravating evidence is just so prejudicial and so overpowering that the jury couldn't really separate the two and would be inclined to sort of judge the second one by association.

This Court has fairly consistently suggested that the cure to a Lockett type of error, that there was something presented that might not have been able to be given effect, would be catch-all or mercy types of instructions. And I would refer you to pages 310 and 11 of Penry 1 where it wasn't the Court, but it was defense who requested a mercy instruction that was not granted. And as a result, the case wound up in front of this Court. But also suggest that you look at page 803 on Penry 2 where this Court suggested -- Justice O'Connor writing -- that a catch-all instruction well crafted would have been the cure for the error this Court found in Penry 2.

Now, a lay juror, being asked to do one task for one purpose and a different task for a different purpose, is not likely to conclude that the two tasks are in some way equivalent. Likewise, to the point that was suggested earlier, Mr. Katyal correctly points out that the mercy instruction is described as a mitigating circumstance.
