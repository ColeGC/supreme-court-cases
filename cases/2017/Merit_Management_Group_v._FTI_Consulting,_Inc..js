So as -- as the trustee's amicus brief said, to sort of carve out, you know, leveraged buyouts from the fraudulent avoidance laws, that's carving out a lot because these are transactions where there is a risk that's quite considerable to mulcting the interest of the unsecured creditors. The last thing I'll say before I sit down is just, in addition to all the other textual arguments we make in the brief, I do think it's worth emphasizing that, under their view of the statute, Congress's effort in 2005 to add financial participants as the sixth on the list of protected entities was completely superfluous and just a fool's errand, because I can't imagine that financial participants who are defined as entities with $100 million or a billion dollars in transactions were doing those transactions with cash.
