Garre","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits the discharge of debts procured by fraudulent statements, other than a statement respecting the debtor's financial condition. Everyone agrees that \"financial condition\" is a term of art used by Congress and in commercial practice to refer to one's overall financial status.","start":7.56,"stop":35.64,"duration":28.08},{"text":"Yet, Respondent and the government ask this Court to interpret Section 523 and, in particular, Congress's use of \"respecting\" to eliminate the meaning of \"financial condition,\" of a term of art, and essentially to substitute the word \"finances\" for it.","start":35.64,"stop":53.52,"duration":17.88}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Can you tell me, Mr. Garre, what is a statement respecting financial condition?

Garre","textObjs":[{"text":"Sure.","start":64.76,"stop":65.4,"duration":0.64},{"text":"Well, our view is that a statement respecting financial condition is a statement that purports to present a picture of one's overall financial situation. And there are several things that could qualify as -- as that. One would, of course, be a classic balance statement or sheet.","start":65.4,"stop":82.4,"duration":17},{"text":"Another would be an indication of net -- net wealth or overall income -- a net -- net worth.","start":82.4,"stop":91.72,"duration":9.32},{"text":"Another would be a credit score, such as those that were common in 1926, when Congress passed this statute. Another would be net cash flow. All of these things look to one's overall financial situation, not to just one side of the ledger, an asset or a liability, and present a picture of overall financial status. And, again, Respondent's interpretation of \"respecting\" essentially eliminates that term as a term of limitation and as a term of art and substitutes the word \"finances\" for it.","start":91.72,"stop":128.12,"duration":36.4},{"text":"So a statement about any individual input, any individual asset, any individual liability suddenly becomes a statement respecting financial condition. And I think there are three central problems with -- with -- with Respondent's interpretation of \"respecting.\" The first is, as I mentioned, that -- that their reading of \"respecting\" to mean \"related to\" eliminates Congress's decision to use the term of art \"financial condition.\" It would be an odd thing for Congress to say we're going to refer to \"financial condition\" but then essentially eliminate the meaning of that by saying \"respecting financial condition.\" And there's no reason why the Court has to interpret \"respecting\" to mean \"related to.\" It can mean \"related to.\" But it can also mean \"about.\" And here in context, reading \"respecting financial condition\" to mean a statement about financial condition makes perfect sense.","start":128.12,"stop":183.52,"duration":55.4},{"text":"To say something is \"about\" means it refers to the subject of the object. Here, the object is the statement and here the subject is financial condition, one's overall financial status. So the fact that their reading of \"respecting\" to mean \"related to\" would eliminate \"financial condition\" as a term of art and a term of limitation is the first reason why this Court --","start":183.52,"stop":204.4,"duration":20.88}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"Could you tell me, Mr. -- Mr. Garre, what you think the difference is between \"relating to\" and \"about\"?","start":204.4,"stop":210.44,"duration":6.04}]},{"speakerName":"Gregory G.

So, in that sense, that's different than just saying we're talking about an individual asset. And then I think the sort of -- the ambiguity in your question was, did you mean his batting average in the game or his season?

If you disagree with that, then I think one fallback position the Court could take would be something like what you said: A reasonable person would view that as a statement about one's overall financial situation.

That's not a statement about overall financial condition.","start":560.36,"stop":580.28,"duration":19.92},{"text":"It's a statement that I have an asset can be -- that can be used to pay a debt. And this case was litigated all the way up on the premise that the statement at issue here was a statement about his tax refund, an individual asset.","start":580.28,"stop":594.12,"duration":13.84},{"text":"They argued below that, in fact, what the law firm was relying upon was its knowledge of his precarious financial condition.","start":594.12,"stop":602.12,"duration":8},{"text":"And the bankruptcy court rejected that and found that, no, it was relying on his statement about the tax refund.

So I think that that's why this case is truly the case about a statement about a single asset, a -- a tax refund, that the debtor in this case lied about. And -- and this -- this paradigm here, the sort of classic collateral paradigm, we're talking about a single asset, couldn't be further removed from the situation that Congress was addressing. And I know not all members of the Court may want to look to that legislative history, but it's sort of the gorilla -- it's the elephant in the room here. And that's that when Congress was looking at this situation in 1978, what it was doing is looking at a particular abusive practice by some creditors, which were using written financial statements essentially to dupe applicants for credit into making false statements by simply omitting debts or assets on those statements, and then using that as coercion once they went into bankruptcy.

The rule advanced by Respondent and the government would essentially wipe out the application of 523's baseline rule in the consumer finance or simple collateral situation. The government says itself on page 18 of its brief that statements respecting debtors' finances are, of course, common in credit transactions.","start":3213.2,"stop":3233.96,"duration":20.76},{"text":"And under the rule that you've just heard today, any false statements about finances are going to result in a debt that's not dischargeable, if they're made orally, which, as the National Federation of Independent Businesses has told this Court, statements about finances are still made orally in common transactions throughout the United States by small businesses and regular folks. And there's just absolutely no indication that Congress intended to put creditors who are blameless in a situation where the debts created by deceitful debtors are going to be entirely discharged under this rule. The Fourth Circuit case law only proves that the Fourth Circuit has invented artificial limits on Respondent's \"related to\" principle.","start":3233.96,"stop":3275.88,"duration":41.92},{"text":"What -- what that case law doesn't show is all the debts about false statements, about individual assets that are being discharged in the Fourth Circuit and putting creditors in hardship situations that Congress did not intend to be discharged.","start":3275.88,"stop":3289.56,"duration":13.68},{"text":"So I don't think the Fourth Circuit case law really gets them anywhere.

In that situation, there's no evidence, either in the text or the history, that Congress intended to weigh the balance in favor of debtors there and excuse debtors by discharging debts procured by fraud.

And one thing, ironically, that I didn't hear from either Respondent or the government today is any real argument based on the text of the statute, either \"respecting,\" which they've relied upon up to this point, or \"financial condition.\" Nor did I hear them dispute that \"financial condition\" does refer to one's overall financial status. And I didn't hear any explanation as to how their \"related to\" interpretation of \"respecting\" doesn't negate that term as a term of art and term of limitation. The last thing I would say is, if this Court does adopt a new test in this area, and there have been, you know, competing versions of possibilities for this Court, we would urge this Court to vacate the decision below and to remand. For one thing, there's -- there's a dispute among the parties about exactly why Respondent made a false statement about the tax refund, whether Lamar was relying on its overall financial status.
