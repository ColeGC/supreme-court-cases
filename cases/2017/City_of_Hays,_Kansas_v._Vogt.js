And, second, because regardless of whether it is possible that some types of Fifth Amendment violations could ever occur before trial, the Court should reject any such notion with regard to the specific type of Fifth Amendment violation alleged here, which is the use of statements in violation of Garrity versus New Jersey.","start":15.32,"stop":49.96,"duration":34.64}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Heytens --","start":49.96,"stop":51.12,"duration":1.16}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony M.

Heytens","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't think that's -- that's right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the reason for that is that it's critical to distinguish between two issues.

But I think there's an even bigger problem, which is the anomaly is actually not a two-part anomaly; it's a three-part anomaly because, as I read this Court's decisions in Hurtado and Gerstein, the State of Kansas could choose option number 3, option number 3 being no grand jury, no probable cause hearing, the prosecution goes forward based on nothing but the prosecutor's determination that there is probable cause.","start":529.76,"stop":560.16,"duration":30.4},{"text":"And there is no suggestion that it would violate the Self-Incrimination Clause for the prosecutor sitting in her office to consider these statements.

But -- but even if the grand jury analogy isn't persuasive to all members of the Court, I think there's another analogy that is extremely damaging, which is the Gerstein analogy because, as I read this Court's decision in Gerstein, the legal question that is decided at a Gerstein hearing, whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused has committed the crime, is legally indistinguishable from the question at Kansas's probable cause hearing. So I'm not sure what the basis on that ground would be for saying that this right applies at the probable cause hearing but doesn't apply at the Gerstein hearing.","start":583.2,"stop":621.96,"duration":38.76},{"text":"And I don't think it's plausible to say that it applies at the Gerstein hearing for all the reasons that the Kansas amicus brief gives, because it's simply not going to be practically possible to have this right at a Gerstein hearing, which is a non-adversarial proceeding where there is no right to counsel and which has to be held within 48 hours of arrest and detention.","start":621.96,"stop":640.08,"duration":18.12}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen G.

Heytens","textObjs":[{"text":"I'd just like to make three quick points in rebuttal: One in response to Justice Kagan's point about the apparent oddity with regard to this particular proceeding, one about suppression hearings, and one about Garrity. So, in response to Justice Kagan's questions about the oddity of this particular type of hearing, I think beyond the fact that the Supreme Court of Kansas has held that the purpose of this hearing is not to adjudicate guilt or punishment, I think an even more important indication of that is that, under Kansas law, nothing that happened at this hearing could conclusively resolve Officer Vogt's guilt or innocence one way or the other. And the way -- the reason that we know that is because the Supreme Court has specifically held that the dismissal of charges after a probable cause hearing is not preclusive of, and without prejudice to, the state's ability to reinitiate the exact same criminal prosecution. Which is the same rule for grand injures, right? The Court has said that just because a grand jury refuses to return an indictment does not mean that the prosecution cannot ask another grand jury to return an indictment. And, in fact, the Supreme Court of Kansas has reversed trial courts who have dismissed the probable cause hearing on the theory that the government will not be able to carry its proof beyond a reasonable doubt burden at trial because, they've said, that's not the purpose of this hearing.","start":3307,"stop":3385.72,"duration":78.72},{"text":"This hearing does not adjudicate guilt or innocence. The point on suppression hearings, I think it's just worth emphasizing again in response to Justice Ginsburg's point, we are not talking about the possibility that someone will have to decide to plead guilty without being able to challenge evidence for one very simple reason: They can file a pretrial motion to suppress. Many -- it is true that a large majority of prosecutions are resolved via guilty plea.","start":3385.72,"stop":3411.48,"duration":25.76},{"text":"But it is also true that before pleading guilty, defendants often file pretrial motions to suppress and only plead guilty after the denial of their motion to suppress. In the federal system, they are even sometimes permitted to file a conditional guilty plea to preserve their ability to challenge the admissibility of the evidence on appeal.","start":3411.48,"stop":3430.56,"duration":19.08},{"text":"So we're not talking about taking people -- away people's ability to challenge. And then last but not least, we didn't discuss it in the initial argument, but this Court -- the second argument that we have raised, the second independent argument, relates that this Court could say, whatever the rule might be with regard to other types of Fifth Amendment claims, there can be no Garrity violation until trial. It would actually be very similar to what I understand a super-majority of this Court said in Chavez with regard to Miranda claims.","start":3430.56,"stop":3459.08,"duration":28.52},{"text":"I understand that, in Chavez, the Court was deeply divided about whether there were circumstances in which an involuntariness claim could occur before trial.","start":3459.08,"stop":3467.52,"duration":8.44},{"text":"But, as I understood, even some of the dissenting justices in Chavez said a Miranda claim is something that can only accrue until trial.
