Congress provided a cause of action for the domestic infringement and provided a damages remedy that guaranteed the victim of the infringement damages adequate to compensate for the infringement. The plain text of the Patent Act, therefore, gives the victim of Section 271(f) infringement an entitlement to adequate damages, including lost profits.","start":23.56,"stop":62.48,"duration":38.92},{"text":"And the presumption against extraterritoriality raises no obstacle to that commonsense result.

So I think it's helpful actually to think about if this whole case happened on Lake Michigan instead of on the high seas, we could sue ION and only ION, not its customers who practice the patent on Lake Michigan, and we could recover our lost profits damages.

Now I do think it's important to recognize, though, that what is the infringing conduct is what ION does in the United States. What the foreign combiners of the components do on the high seas is not infringement of a U.S. patent at all, which is why I think the presumption against extraterritoriality is really a misfit here. And you have to resort to the general principle, which is, in U.S. law, if somebody's injured domestically by domestic conduct, there's no rule that says that, in order to calculate the compensatory damages to make them whole, if you have to include in your calculation some foreign thing, there's no rule against that.

To the extent that Petitioner is relying on Section 271(f), that's really window dressing on its argument because, at bottom, the rule would be the same under Petitioner's interpretation in the 271(f) or the 271(a) context.
