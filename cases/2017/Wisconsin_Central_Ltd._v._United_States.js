The first is that the government argues that that exemption is relevant to this case because, in the government's view, it essentially renders our definition -- or it would render the provision surplusage under our definition of money remuneration.

What the -- the government has identified, and Your Honor alluded to this, is that Railroad Retirement Board regulation that actually first was issued by way of a decision in 1938, and we think that's very telling, because what the Railroad Retirement Board says is it says, under the statutory language, we will only treat stock as remuneration if the party, the employer and the employee agree to do so, and that they can value it in advance.

The second point is to the extent the government argues that anything that can be valued and sold for cash falls within this capacious definition of money is wrong because I can think of many things that can be sold faster for cash at a much lower transaction cost, for example, baseball tickets. If I have two tickets to the Nationals and Rockies game, I can sell those and change those into cash a lot faster than I could find a broker and sell my shares of stock on a market.
