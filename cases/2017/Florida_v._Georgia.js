Garre","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Special Master based his recommendation on two critical premises: First, that Florida has suffered real harm as a result of Georgia's ever-increasing consumption of upstream waters; and, second, that Georgia's consumption is unreasonable and largely unrestrained.","start":6.6,"stop":31.04,"duration":24.44},{"text":"In fact, the Special Master found that Georgia's position practically, politically, and legally is that it can consume as much water as it wishes without regard to any of the long-term consequences for the Apalachicola region. The Special Master nevertheless concluded that this case should be terminated at the outset and that Georgia's wasteful consumption be allowed to continue unabated because Florida had failed to show an adequate -- adequate certainty of complete relief. With respect to the Special Master, we believe he -- he made a legal error on this discrete issue, that the case should be returned to him for him to complete the work that he has begun.","start":31.04,"stop":75.6,"duration":44.56}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Garre, I thought that the Special Master -- this is at page 63 to 65 of his report -- said that Florida at the trial concentrated only on the harm from the low flows in drought years and it did not address the benefits of increased flow during normal non-drought periods. It didn't even address it, he said, no -- no less showed the benefits that it would gain.","start":75.6,"stop":110.88,"duration":35.28},{"text":"So he said if -- if Florida has not established its case, it's Florida's fault because all they did was concentrate on the drought years.","start":110.88,"stop":122.64,"duration":11.76}]},{"speakerName":"Gregory G. Garre","textObjs":[{"text":"Right.","start":122.64,"stop":122.92,"duration":0.28},{"text":"And I think, first of all, the Special Master's entire report has to be viewed in light of the legal standard of redressability that he applied.","start":122.92,"stop":130.72,"duration":7.8},{"text":"And we believe that he applied far too great of a standard. Second of all, I think it is fair to say that Florida's presentation was focused on the harm that we suffered during drought conditions in the extreme low-flow periods. But two things about that are important to understand. There's two ways to redress that harm. One is to provide more water during those periods, the extreme low-flow periods, the worst of the worst, and the other way is to reduce the frequency and severity of those drought operations. And the United States, even the United States in this case -- and it's at page 28 of its brief -- recognizes that a decree in this case limiting Georgia's consumption would benefit Florida by reducing the frequency, severity, and duration of drought conditions. Now, we think that that benefit --","start":130.72,"stop":182.6,"duration":51.88}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"Where does the record show that?","start":182.6,"stop":184.64,"duration":2.04}]},{"speakerName":"Gregory G.

Well, what I can point you to, for example, is the 2012 drought.","start":184.64,"stop":192.72,"duration":8.08},{"text":"And we've explained this in the evidence cites at pages 48 to 49 of our brief. And what that example shows is that if more water had come into the system during the 2012 drought, which one of -- is one of the worst that the region has experienced, it would have meant that the Corps would not have dipped into its drought operations during -- for -- for nine months during that period, which means that the Corps would not have fallen into the red zone, where all the sort of needles are at the far end of the spectrum, for nine months during that drought. And that has to have resulted in beneficial effects for Florida.","start":192.72,"stop":229.52,"duration":36.8}]},{"speakerName":"Elena Kagan","textObjs":[{"text":"So here -- here's my difficulty, Mr. Garre, with this argument.","start":229.52,"stop":232.2,"duration":2.68},{"text":"And it's especially with respect to this exception 2d, I think it is.","start":232.2,"stop":235.92,"duration":3.72}]},{"speakerName":"Gregory G.

Garre","textObjs":[{"text":"Well -- and I'm going to get back to the -- the evidentiary cites, but on that, Justice Ginsburg, and just to be clear, we think that one of the Special Master's central error was to deal with all of this on the basis of a central -- of a threshold redressability inquiry and that instead what this should have done is gone to the equitable balancing stage of the equitable apportionment proceeding, where the Special Master would have to make all the findings that he did not complete on the -- on the costs that Georgia would incur of a decree, the full range of harms that Florida has suffered.","start":336,"stop":369.24,"duration":33.24},{"text":"He didn't conclude those findings.","start":369.24,"stop":371.04,"duration":1.8}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony M.
