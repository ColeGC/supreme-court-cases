So, if we can permit the government as employer to have a compelling interest to do something as dramatic as firing someone, why can't that interest in having workplace peace, workplace routine in which issues are decided in a -- in a collective way, why isn't that a compelling interest comparable to the others?","start":120.72,"stop":179.04,"duration":58.32}]},{"speakerName":"William L.

And then, with respect to the third point, the test suggested in the dissent in Lehnert, the problem with that is that it allows for charging of collective bargaining and anything else that the government decided that the union had a duty to bargain over. So, in other words, that test, the statutory duties test, allows the government to decide what is constitutionally chargeable under the First Amendment.
