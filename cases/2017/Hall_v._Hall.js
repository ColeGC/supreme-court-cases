First, it comes from a final judgment entered in the case.","start":15.2,"stop":24.92,"duration":9.72},{"text":"It provides a bright-line rule that brooks no exception.","start":24.92,"stop":28.96,"duration":4.04},{"text":"When a final judgment is entered, you have a right of appeal. Second, Rule 42 does not merge cases. There's a careful architecture in the federal rules from Rules 13 through Rule 24 designed to bring cases that should be tried as one case together. Rule 42, on the other hand, is for the exceptional case that doesn't fall within the categories that fall under Rules 13 through 24.

What (a)(1) does is allow for, like -- as I say, an omnibus hearing that -- where the cases remain on separate tracks.","start":138.96,"stop":150.92,"duration":11.96},{"text":"And if I can give an example of how that would work, suppose there is a mass tort, a industrial explosion. You have a class of plaintiffs, separate actions, that are death cases.","start":150.92,"stop":162.24,"duration":11.32},{"text":"You have some who are terminally ill from this case, from this explosion.","start":162.24,"stop":166.4,"duration":4.16},{"text":"You have some that have property damage only.

Roberts, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Yeah, but, I mean, I -- yes, but I think most people would think that the district court has a greater familiarity with the litigation, particularly since the court of appeals may know nothing about it until you get a notification, and understands how related the two cases are or how not related they are.","start":429.84,"stop":448.32,"duration":18.48},{"text":"And maybe the ability to consolidate ought to continue to -- I mean, to keep the cases together, to the extent appropriate, ought to remain with the district court, rather than suddenly throwing the issue before a court of appeals that is new to the whole litigation.","start":448.32,"stop":464.84,"duration":16.52}]},{"speakerName":"Andrew C. Simpson","textObjs":[{"text":"It -- that -- that's certainly the argument that has been made by the amici, but I think if you look at the architecture of the rules, again, Rule 23(f) also deals with an appeal coming up, an interlocutory appeal under the class action statutes, and there the discretion is given completely to the appellate court.","start":464.84,"stop":484.68,"duration":19.84},{"text":"And --","start":484.68,"stop":485.64,"duration":0.96}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"But what about the district court in a case like this one?

Simpson","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, to address the first question, I -- I think the district court has great latitude to do this, but it's under the rubric of Rule 13, compulsory counterclaims, Rule 14, third-party practice, Rule 19, joinder of indispensable parties. That's where these -- the Footnote 7 cases in Gelboim, the cases that should have been filed as one, that's where that's supposed to happen.","start":557.4,"stop":584.92,"duration":27.52},{"text":"That's not where it comes up in Rule 42. In terms of a trap for the unwary, the double final judgment rule that my friend proposes actually creates the trap for the unwary because you can have situations where a final judgment is not entered after your case is dismissed and a final judgment is entered. You can have a situation where you don't know how the court is going to deem it consolidated because, if I understand their argument, if it's consolidated for trial, they agree that it can be appealed immediately, but if -- a final judgment is entered, but if it's consolidated for this nebulous all purposes, it cannot.","start":584.92,"stop":621.16,"duration":36.24}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony M.
