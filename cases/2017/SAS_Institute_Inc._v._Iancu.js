Those claims are what are known as means-plus-function claims, where under Section 1112(f) -- or 112(f) their meaning is determined by a particular structure set forth in the specification, not in the claim itself. Accordingly, the Board's regulations -- and this is 42.104 -- require a petition for inter partes review to identify what structure do you think determines the construction of this claim so that we, the Board, can determine if it's unpatentable?
