Hellman","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress made it a felony to obstruct the due administration of the tax code, it was not creating an all-purpose tax crime; it was borrowing from a statute that prohibited the obstruction of a pending proceeding. This Court normally presumes that borrowed language carries its meaning with it. And that has to be the case here, for without that limitation, obstruction would swallow up the other crimes that Congress simultaneously enacted and, in particular, it would obliterate the careful line that Congress drew between misdemeanors and felonies. Indeed, the government's interpretation is so broad that it would chill entirely legitimate conduct that Congress never intended to penalize.","start":7.64,"stop":48.4,"duration":40.76}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"What -- what -- what lawful conduct would the government's reading put at risk?","start":48.4,"stop":55.24,"duration":6.84}]},{"speakerName":"Matthew S.

And at that question -- at that point, the only question that remains is mens rea, why did you do it? Did you do it for the purpose of obtaining an unlawful benefit? And even -- that benefit need not even be your own under the government's reading; it could be the benefit of the gardener.

Let's say somebody is being audited and eventually the person comes up with the records that the auditor needs, but they're all scrambled up, and it looks like -- and -- and the person is -- is late in providing them and misses meetings and just is very difficult.

And the government could do nothing about it, unless the individual actually happened to be obstructing a pending audit or investigation. Audits and investigations are types of administration, but the Internal Revenue Code contains an entire subtitle called \"Procedure and Administration\" that lists in sequential chapters all of the different types of administration that occur. That includes the gathering of information that taxpayers must self-report. It includes the calculation and assessment of taxes, the collection of taxes.

In the context of willful tax violations, I think in the substantial majority of cases, if not all, you're going to have a prosecutor who can say this was done for a reason, some unlawful benefit, which need not even be financial. Second, as to the safeguards that the mens rea requirement offers, in a world in which not consulting fully with an accountant, paying in cash, not keeping all records, can become obstruction, if they're done for the wrong reason, then you really are leaving it up to the prosecutor, who is required under current charging rules to charge as aggressively as possible, to decide what was in the defendant's mind.
