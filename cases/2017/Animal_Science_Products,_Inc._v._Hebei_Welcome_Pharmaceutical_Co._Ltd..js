The answer to that question is no. District courts have the authority to resolve their concerns by considering any relevant materials, even if they go beyond the materials presented by the sovereign. On the motion to dismiss in this case, the district court found that the amicus brief that was submitted by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce failed to answer important questions about how its Vitamin C regulations applied to the specific agreements that were identified in the complaint.","start":7.805,"stop":54.615,"duration":46.81},{"text":"It also found that the Ministry's interpretation appeared to be at odds with the regulations that it cited and the documentary evidence before the court.

And what we understand the Second Circuit to have done -- and this is the clearest in Footnote 10 of its opinion on page 30a -- is to say that when a foreign government presents its views about the construction of its laws to a U.S. court, the U.S. court is bound to defer if that construction is facially reasonable and the U.S. court cannot look behind that construction to things like contradictory statements in other fora or to other relevant materials on foreign law that cast doubt on the foreign sovereign's representation.
