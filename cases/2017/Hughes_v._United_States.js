And the government could talk about that at sentencing on those charges.

But to answer the second part of the question, the district court judge, exercising her or his discretion, will apply the 3553(a) factors just like they do in any other case where there's a request for discretionary relief under 3582(c)(2).

In a circumstance, for instance, under which the district court says -- using the discretion that it has post-Booker under cases like Gall and Spears, the district court says I'm not applying the guidelines at all, I disagree with the guidelines as a policy matter; under those circumstances, it's very hard to see how in any ordinary meaning of the term a sentence is based on the guidelines.

First of all, Marks focuses on the holding or the judgment of the Court.","start":488.305,"stop":498.44,"duration":10.13},{"text":"And so, under Marks, what we're trying to figure out is whether there's precedent.","start":498.44,"stop":503.07,"duration":4.63},{"text":"Ordinarily, only a court's holding qualifies as precedent, and a holding is the reasoning that's necessary to support the judgment. The government's alternate approach, its run-the-facts-through-the-opinions approach, first of all, I'm not sure it even purports to be an application of Marks in that sense. Second of all, it is predicated upon counting dissenting votes.","start":503.07,"stop":529.345,"duration":26.28},{"text":"And Marks itself says quite specifically that that's not what Marks is about. Marks talks about the position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments.","start":529.345,"stop":540.37,"duration":11.02},{"text":"And O'Dell at page 160 speaks in similar terms, votes necessary to the judgment.","start":540.37,"stop":546.845,"duration":6.48}]},{"speakerName":"John G.

And, of course, it would be.","start":561.1,"stop":573.745,"duration":12.64},{"text":"The same way that lower courts are wise to look at this Court's dicta, to look at concurring opinions --","start":573.745,"stop":580.52,"duration":6.77}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Then why should they -- why should they pretend that this Court had an opinion that counts as precedent?

And, here, what the Eleventh Circuit concluded was simply that it had to follow the concurring opinion in Freeman, that it was the vote of one justice was the law of the land, notwithstanding the fact that eight justices had sharply disagreed with that reasoning. And so, Justice Ginsburg, we think that that's not right.","start":614.76,"stop":647.37,"duration":32.61},{"text":"Now, to be clear, a lower court could say: I am going to count votes.","start":647.37,"stop":653.04,"duration":5.67},{"text":"I am going to predict what the Supreme Court might do.

Alito, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, Marks has been the -- the law for 40 years, and for better or worse, it has had a big effect, I think, on what we have understood to be the jurisprudence of this Court and what the lower courts have understood to be our precedents and on the way in which justices of this Court go about doing their job.
