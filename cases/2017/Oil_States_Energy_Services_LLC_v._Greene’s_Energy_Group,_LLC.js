It has the component that is directed toward the individual rights guarantee, so the guarantee of litigants to impartial decision-makers and at the same time at the structural protections, the checks and balances protections that protect the -- the judicial integrity. So I think the difference here is that when Congress -- and certainly individual rights are at stake when the government takes property that belongs to one person for a public use and doesn't pay just compensation.

Even if that were narrow, I think this Court has said that it's no more permissible for Congress to -- to kind of nibble around the edges, as opposed to a wholesale transfer, but even so, here, setting aside that those two areas of novelty and obviousness make up about 60 percent of the patent validity challenges in the district courts, the estoppel provisions provide that, in the 80 percent of cases, in 80 percent of inter partes reviews, those proceedings are taking place with concurrent district court litigation.
