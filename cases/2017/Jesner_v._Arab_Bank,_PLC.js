So what do you say about that?

First of all, thank goodness we don't really have a lot of U.S. corporations that are violating international law right here in America, but if they did, there would be plenty of defendants under the ATS and under other provisions. So the real incidence of this, the real impact of corporate liability is the ability to get a company -- a corporation like Arab Bank that's a cornerstone of the Jordanian economy, and you get them in here, you cause all sorts of diplomatic friction and then, as a bonus, you don't have to worry about whether the -- the mens rea of somebody in Jordan and the mens rea of somebody who processed the transaction in the United States, whether any of those actually satisfied the requirements of the tort, because you can mush them all together and say it's corporate responsibility.

First of all, the Bormes case, which is cited in the Solicitor General's brief dealing with the Little Tucker Act a few years ago, free and clear of all of the extraterritoriality concerns and everything else, just this Court straightforwardly said -- citing the provision there that said who could be sued, that that was part of the remedial structure of the Little Tucker Act.

Israel, if the -- if suits like this were taken away, Israel and countries like it might well have a complaint to the United States. And finally, Justice Gorsuch, I wanted to turn back to your question about the history and make two additional points.
