In a subpoena context, the instrument operates on a person and it places an obligation on that person to make disclosure. Once it gets to the government, once the government has the account in hand, it executes the warrant aspect of the order, which is a probable-cause-based order, allowing the government to search the account. So it's essentially analogous to if the government knew that an individual had a laptop computer and it wanted to obtain that computer and search it, it could serve a subpoena on the individual requiring the production of the laptop. Once the government gets the laptop into its custody, it needs a search warrant to get in and look at the information.","start":112.96,"stop":166.44,"duration":53.48},{"text":"And here a single order achieves both functions under a statute whose structure and language makes clear that it places disclosure obligations on a provider and it then authorizes the government to conduct the search.","start":166.44,"stop":180.96,"duration":14.52}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Dreeben --","start":180.96,"stop":181.44,"duration":0.48}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Dreeben, may I ask you a broader question?
