We can dress it up using the language of jurisdiction, but it's still taking the case away from the courts and directing the outcome. Now, on the point, the distinction that counsel for the Respondents were trying to drive home, that somehow a direction to dismiss in 2(b) is different because it's not merits. I would refer to the Court to a unanimous decision from last year, CRST versus EEOC, where the Court found the -- the party that was not prevailing in -- that -- that did not win on the merits in the EEOC case was nevertheless the prevailing party. The Court, unanimous Court observed the defendant, however, has fulfilled its primary objective whenever plaintiff's challenge is rebuffed, irrespective of the precise reason. As anyone who has ever been a plaintiff or represented a plaintiff knows, when the plaintiff's case is dismissed, the plaintiff has lost and the defendant has won. It could have different collateral consequences, res judicata and so on, but fundamentally, when the plaintiff gets kicked out of court, they have lost. Mr. Patchak had that result as -- from 2(b).

Respondents -- Federal Respondents said they didn't know quite what some of the provisions in the Gun Lake Act means except they do know that it prevents Mr. Patchak's case from going forward. This seems to me that their uncertain about the meaning, except when it comes to its application to Mr. Patchak, only highlights the fact that Congress was trying to direct the outcome in Mr. Patchak's case.
