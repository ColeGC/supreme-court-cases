The first is that requiring the government to include a date ensures that when the time is stopped, when the immigrant is prevented from accruing additional time, the government is actually serious about proceeding with -- with a -- with a removal proceeding, of going forward with the proceeding. And if you look at a case like Camarillo, you can see why that's important, where the government served one of these notices that did not include the time and place, and then just sat on it for over two years without doing anything at all.

And, you know, there's nothing inherently wrong with doing that, with serving notice of charges and saying we're going to go forward with a proceeding at some undefinite time in the -- indefinite time in the future.

And that makes sense, especially looking at the legislative history of why Congress actually enacted this rule.","start":617.07,"stop":646.155,"duration":29.08},{"text":"And the reason that was, was that Congress wanted to make sure that immigrants were not able to -- to avoid or delay proceedings in order to manufacture additional time. So, prior to 1996, there was -- Congress thought that there was a problem because, because time continued to accrue until the person was actually removed from the country, that created an -- an incentives -- incentive for immigrants to file motions and to avoid proceedings, to draw out proceedings and gain additional time. So what the stop-time rule does is it says at the time there's an actual hearing, when the government is prepared to go forward with the hearing and schedules a hearing that could be avoided or delayed, then time stops.
