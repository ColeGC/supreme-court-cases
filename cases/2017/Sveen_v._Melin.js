So your first question is, what if this was the first statute on -- on this issue; in other words, the first ever revocation-on-divorce statute? Well, I'd point out that even when the first of these statutes were enacted around 30 years ago, there already were a number of statutes, almost universally, in fact, that revorced -- that revoked wills upon divorce. So, really, the -- the historic purpose of these statutes, according to the Uniform Probate Code, was to align the law of life insurance policies with the law of wills. So we would take the position that even the first of these statutes that was enacted could be applied to existing policies under the -- the Contracts Clause. To turn to your second question, which was what if, empirically speaking, someone didn't know? So, first of all, I do think that -- I don't mean to fight the hypothetical, but, in this case, I think the legislature made the empirical determination that the typical person designates a spouse as a beneficiary because it's the spouse, and when the divorce happens, the calculus changes.","start":87.49,"stop":141.41,"duration":53.92},{"text":"And --","start":141.41,"stop":141.63,"duration":0.22}]},{"speakerName":"Sonia Sotomayor","textObjs":[{"text":"On the basis of what?

So I think that when you talk about the broad police power over divorce and then the fact that it's only writing a letter, I think the statute is constitutional, especially -- and the third thing I'd like to talk about is the reliance issue because this is a case about retroactivity.
