And so that's simply inconsistent with the basic policies of the Sherman Act, which is that not just price but quality considerations and all other considerations are best satisfied through competition. And I still think that it's fundamentally inconsistent with this Court's rule of reason cases in the vertical context. In -- in the resale price maintenance context, the Court made quite clear that, even though resale price maintenance might lead to higher prices for the higher services being imposed, if consumers didn't like those higher services, they can always switch to cheaper goods, a cheaper manufacturer's good. That is the fundamental problem that we have with this restraint.","start":637.4,"stop":693.8,"duration":56.4},{"text":"Unlike resale price maintenance, it has restricted interbrand competition, and so it's affected all competitors, relieving them of the ability to provide the low cost -- low cost product that consumers might want.

And I'd like to echo one of the things that Mr. Murphy was saying, that from our point of view, it's entirely legitimate for Amex to pursue a strategy where it produces higher rewards for cardholders and charges a premium and it's fully free to attempt to persuade its cardholders that the extra value is worth the extra cost.
