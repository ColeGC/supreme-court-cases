And I think the most telling moment in Mr. Tripp's argument was when he was asked about our hypothetical of an order that authorized a 180-day wiretap, and in response to that, tellingly, he didn't attempt to make the argument that that would not fall within the scope of the phrase \"insufficient.\" He turned it to the government's severance argument instead.
