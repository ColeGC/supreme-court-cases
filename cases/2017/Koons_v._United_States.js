Fisher","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, Justice Sotomayor. But let me put this answer in context.","start":173.52,"stop":176.56,"duration":3.04},{"text":"So, first of all, remember, sometimes the guideline range is going to be above the minimum, and sometimes it's going to be below, and sometimes it's going to straddle the minimum.","start":176.56,"stop":183.64,"duration":7.08},{"text":"So what Section 3553(e) does is says when the judge grants a substantial assistance motion, the judge should then sentence that defendant like anyone else, which is go to the guideline range. Now, yes, that departure under 5K1 is going to be from the guideline range, regardless of whether it's above or below the minimum.","start":183.64,"stop":203.68,"duration":20.04},{"text":"But, yes, the court is directed to just sentence that defendant according to the guideline range, just as he would any other defendant. And that makes perfect sense, because, again, what Congress has done, remember, is set up a default regime of guided discretion under the guidelines as set by guideline ranges according to offense level and criminal history categories.","start":203.68,"stop":225.24,"duration":21.56},{"text":"And then it has stepped in and created a disruption in a limited context of mandatory minimums in particular drug cases, but then Congress says, if there's substantial assistance given, those two things cancel each other out and we just want you to go back to the default range. And if I could add one other thing to your question, Justice Sotomayor, that I think puts this all together, it's to refer to the Court's opinion in Melendez.","start":225.24,"stop":246.76,"duration":21.52},{"text":"Remember, in Melendez, the Court talks about two different types of substantial assistance departures. One is from the guideline range under 5K.","start":246.76,"stop":254.68,"duration":7.92},{"text":"The other, if the government wants to allow it, is to allow that departure to go beneath the mandatory minimum if the government puts that as part of the motion. So, when you go to 5K in the guidelines, which is where these departures get calculated, the beginning of 5K says that a court may depart from the guideline range if the substantial assistance warrants that departure. The guideline at 5K says nothing -- says nothing at all about departing from the mandatory minimum.","start":254.68,"stop":284.52,"duration":29.84},{"text":"There's no such thing in the guidelines.","start":284.52,"stop":286.4,"duration":1.88},{"text":"Only departures occur from the guideline range. And I think what cements this, if I could return the -- the Court to the text that I was referring to at page 3a of the government's brief, it's the sentence -- it's the reference to Section 994 as a whole. The way the government reads this sentence is that the government says, well, all that sentence does is direct the court to the 5K guidelines, which are the ones for measuring the substantial assistance departure. But if that were so, what that text would say is Section 994(n), because subsection 994(n) is the place in the Commission's authority where Congress directs it to deal with substantial assistance scenarios. But, instead, what Congress did in Section 3553(e) is refer to 994 as a whole, which includes the entire guidelines system. And if you compare that to the other statutory provisions on these two pages, 2a and 3a, you'll see that, on page 2a, Congress refers no fewer than four times to particular subsections of 994. So, when Congress wanted to limit a court's authority or to direct it to particular guidelines, provisions, or particular elements of the Commission's authority, Congress did so specifically.","start":286.4,"stop":361.32,"duration":74.92},{"text":"By contrast --","start":361.32,"stop":362.16,"duration":0.84}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Fisher, there's a -- there's an anomaly in the position you take.","start":362.16,"stop":367.08,"duration":4.92},{"text":"That is, if the defendants involved here, if they were to appear for initial sentencing today, they would get the very same sentence that they got -- that the -- the sentence that they are now serving.","start":367.08,"stop":387.6,"duration":20.52},{"text":"So that seems a little odd that -- that people who, if they were being sentenced today, would get the exact same sentence, should get the benefit of this scale-down.","start":387.6,"stop":400.96,"duration":13.36}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey L.

If a district judge in that case says to himself, well, look, the guidelines really didn't have any meaningful effect the first time around, that may well be a reason to deny sentence mod -- sentence modification in that context.

But we're not in that case.","start":805.12,"stop":810.6,"duration":5.48},{"text":"We're in the first type of case.","start":810.6,"stop":811.96,"duration":1.36}]},{"speakerName":"Jeffrey L. Fisher","textObjs":[{"text":"Right.","start":811.96,"stop":812.24,"duration":0.28},{"text":"So let me say two very important things to that question because I think it's probably the hardest part about this case. The first is that for the very reason you stated, Justice Sotomayor, that there's such wide variance, sometimes not just between districts but between courtrooms in the same courthouse, it would be -- it would be in -- in contravention of the very principles of the Sentencing Reform Act, which say avoid sentencing disparities, to deny relief to some of those defendants and to give other defendants relief, just based on the happenstance of what judge that defendant happened to adhere -- appear in front of. We think it's a better rule to ask what the law required the judge to do.","start":812.24,"stop":850.96,"duration":38.72},{"text":"And if the law required the judge to consult the guidelines, that should be enough to get into the eligibility of relief. But the second point I want to make, Justice Sotomayor, is even if you want to look at what the judge did on the record, warts and all, mistakes and all, we still win this case. And that's because the judge in our case adjusted up to the mandatory minimum because of 5G1.1.","start":850.96,"stop":873.8,"duration":22.84},{"text":"And, as I've described, we think that was incorrect. But even if you accept that as something that happened and something you need to take into account, the Sentencing Commission has addressed that exact scenario in the policy statement that -- that accompanied Amendment 782, which brings us here today. And this is in Section 1B1.10(c).","start":873.8,"stop":893.08,"duration":19.28},{"text":"The Sentencing Commission says when you calculate an amended range under the guidelines, pursuant to this amendment, you should disregard 5G1.1 and use the range itself and not adjust. So even if we were in a world where we had to argue that in our case, even if the judge made a mistake and relied on a guideline incorrectly, that has been taken care of by the Sentencing Commission amendments.","start":893.08,"stop":917.4,"duration":24.32},{"text":"And so we still have a lower guideline range after Amendment 782, which is all that's required to get relief under Section 3582. And I think that adds one other thing I want to say, and it brings me back to Justice Ginsburg's question about the concern about disparities and who gets relief and who doesn't. We think that our solution actually, for the reasons I just described, avoids sentencing disparities and also avoids sentencing disparities because we're asking for our sentences to be adjusted just as somebody would be sentenced today. As we point out in our briefing, though, the government is the one that creates the disparity problem because, under the government's view, people whose guideline ranges were above the minimum, and even if the judge sentenced below, those people are eligible for Section 3582 relief. And the only difference between those people and -- and our clients in this case is that the guidelines measured their crimes as being more serious than the ones our clients committed. And we think it would be highly irregular and, in fact, perverse for a court to say for the people who committed more serious offenses but are otherwise identically situated, we are going to grant them relief in sentences reductions, but not the people whose crimes weren't judged to be quite as serious. They are not even allowed to ask the judge to exercise discretion in their favor. So we think that would be a wild anomaly that this Court ought to construe Section 3582 to avoid. If there are no more questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.","start":917.4,"stop":1014.2,"duration":96.8}]},{"speakerName":"John G.

Amendment 782 says nothing about cooperation or differentiating between two defendants subject to statutory minimums because one cooperated and one didn't.

The reason it couldn't work that way is, although the guidelines are not mandatory now, and we understand that is a constitutional ruling, Congress implemented this against the backdrop of guidelines it believed were mandatory.

And I think \"based on the sentencing range\" means that the number that 3553(a)(4) gave back to the district judge, when he computed the guidelines, was actually the number -- it should actually be that number. And where there was an error there, I don't think 3582(c)(2) should be applied to give the defendant further relief. And the reason for that is the guidelines, the third place \"sentencing range\" is used, are required to return a sentencing range to the district judge that complies with all statutory law. And when the Commission changes a guidelines range, it only has permission to do so outside the context of statutory minimums. And so the whole function of 3582(c)(2) is to give defendants the benefit of judgments that the Commission has made that would change their sentences if they were sentenced properly for the first time today.","start":2413.68,"stop":2489.64,"duration":75.96},{"text":"And that puts them on par with sentence -- defendants who are getting sentenced properly for the first time today. It doesn't really make sense to give them relief where the Commission's changed a judgment that shouldn't have had any effect on their sentences to begin with. The second legal operative rule I would suggest here, and this is specific to the context of statutory minimums, is that nothing in Section 3582(c)(2) itself or any related statute allows the Commission to grant retroactive sentencing relief that would allow a defendant to receive a sentence that is below a statutory minimum. They don't claim that the Commission could write a rule that says everyone who is sentenced to a 20-year statutory minimum under 21 U.S.C. 841 now gets a 10-year sentence. Instead, to the extent they're relying on the ability of the Commission or the judge to recommend or impose a sentence that is below the statutory minimum, they're relying on Section 3553(e). And for the reasons I've given and am happy to get back to and -- and perhaps add a few more, Section 3553(e) does not remove the mandatory minimum for all purposes.

We can disagree -- we don't -- but one could disagree, as the district judge did, with the policy wisdom of some of these statutory minimum sentences, but the fact remains that in the eyes of Congress, a defendant who has committed an offense like these Petitioners did with the criminal history that these Petitioners have has committed an offense that warrants a particular statutory minimum.

And the third disparity is one I've mentioned a few times here today, which is that, again, I think there would be an anomaly in their view of how substantial assistance sentencing works. Even if we get rid of that very odd situation that I think would come up quite a bit when the guidelines were mandatory and shows Congress couldn't have intended it to work the way they're suggesting, I still think it is very odd for Congress to have enacted a statute that would allow a defendant who is sentenced to a statutory minimum and then cooperates to presumptively receive a sentence -- the same sentence if he had -- that he would have gotten if he hadn't cooperated and if he committed a different crime.

The last point, aside from all these legal points that Mr. Feigin made and the government makes, was a policy argument that it would be a double benefit of sorts for cooperators to have their sentences pegged under (e) to a guideline and then perhaps depart it down from that. We just disagree with that premise. Remember, it's not a -- the benefit of cooperation is to be treated just like anybody else.","start":3403.08,"stop":3430.32,"duration":27.24},{"text":"It's not a double benefit.","start":3430.32,"stop":3431.6,"duration":1.28},{"text":"It's just a benefit -- it's just telling the court, look, if you have a cooperator, take away the mandatory minimum and sentence him just as you would sentence anybody else. Now the judge would have discretion to give that defendant a within guideline range or the judge would have discretion, if there were exceptional cooperation, to go below the guideline range.","start":3431.6,"stop":3448.4,"duration":16.8},{"text":"But that's in the court's discretion, and Congress has just given the court the ordinary discretion that somebody else would have. Another way to think about what (e) does is it says we want all cooperators treated the same.","start":3448.4,"stop":3460.4,"duration":12},{"text":"Regardless of whether the cooperator is subject to a mandatory minimum or not, we want to lift the mandatory minimum for those who are and just have them sentenced according to the guidelines.","start":3460.4,"stop":3469.32,"duration":8.92},{"text":"So cooperators are very important to the justice system.","start":3469.32,"stop":3471.68,"duration":2.36},{"text":"The government relies on them heavily.","start":3471.68,"stop":3473.68,"duration":2},{"text":"And so, when a -- when a defendant makes the very difficult choice to cooperate, we want that defendant treated just like anybody else. And one last thing on the policy is that he said, well, our -- our result running the section -- through Section 3582 would be to give only cooperators the benefit of the Sentencing Commission's drug guideline reduction.","start":3473.68,"stop":3494.88,"duration":21.2},{"text":"That's just factually inaccurate. For all defendants who are subject to a mandatory minimum but whose guideline range were above the mandatory minimum, they too get the benefit of section -- of -- of Amendment 782 regardless of whether they cooperated.","start":3494.88,"stop":3508.4,"duration":13.52},{"text":"And I think the government admitted that in its brief, so that's just a small inaccuracy I wanted to correct.

And the better way to read the text is to ask what the law required in that situation, for the reasons I've said and for some of the reasons Mr. Feigin have said.","start":3521.72,"stop":3538,"duration":16.28},{"text":"But if you're unpersuaded by that, I want to reiterate what we say in our opening brief and then -- and then say it again at page 15 and 16 of our reply brief, which is: If you want to do this, as a historical question, exactly what the judge did, warts and all, we win. And the reason why is because the judge adjusted the guideline sentences in our cases according to Subsection 5G1.1 and the Commission, as part of its amendments to 782 and the policy statements accompanying it, said when you calculate an amendment -- an amended guideline range, you do not include Section 5G1.1 as part of that calculation. So we have explained to the Court, and I don't think it's rebuttable, that even if you take the mistake the judge made in the first instance as a historical fact that the Court has to deal with, they still have lower guideline ranges under Section 3582. And that's all that's required for eligibility.","start":3538,"stop":3591.84,"duration":53.84},{"text":"And so, for all the reasons that several justices of the Court have said, whether you -- no matter what you do, I think the safest way to resolve these cases, this narrow band of cases you're dealing with here with cooperators whose -- whose guideline ranges were below the mandatory minimum is to send them back to the district judge and allow the judge to exercise the informed expertise that the Congress imagined and that Section 3582 in particular envisions to decide whether these defendants should get a new sentence or not, and how much that sentence -- new sentence should be reduced.
