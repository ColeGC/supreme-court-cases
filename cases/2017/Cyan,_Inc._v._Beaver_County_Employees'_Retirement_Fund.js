And, in addition, as this Court in Kircher said, when you don't have a long history of state court adjudication in the area, presumptions about preemption don't apply -- indeed, presumptions about preemptions, Justice Breyer, your opinion in Geier says they don't apply when you have an express statute that deals with preemption.

And Justice Ginsburg asked why would Congress, when they're so concerned about procedure and things like abusive litigation and serial plaintiffs and massive attorneys' fees, and took all these steps to regulate that in the federal court context, why would they just leave the back door gaping and wide open?
