The question remains: How should a court of appeals exercise its discretion when confronted with an obvious guidelines error that probably results in a defendant serving a longer prison sentence? We ask the Court to recognize what every circuit but the Fifth already has; that is, in the ordinary case, such an error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the judicial proceedings and warrants correction.","start":8.7,"stop":51.125,"duration":42.43}]},{"speakerName":"John G.

Certainly, a sentence of an extra 20 years, versus a day, 20 years is worse, but, under the analysis of the fourth prong, the question really is, does the nature of the error frustrate the purposes served by the rule at issue? And in the context of the guidelines, a guidelines error directly frustrates the very purposes served by the sentencing guidelines scheme: the congressional goals to promote uniformity and proportionality and to avoid unwarranted disparity; to achieve parsimony, meaning that a defendant is sentenced to the least amount of time necessary to effectuate the statutory goals; and to have respect for the district court --","start":63.94,"stop":117.835,"duration":53.9}]},{"speakerName":"John G.
