We're asking for the common law rule here. And if you look at Prosser on Torts, he says, people keep getting mistaken between malicious prosecution, which has always had a no probable cause requirement, and false imprisonment, of which false arrest is a subset, which has never had that requirement at common law as part of the Plaintiff's case-in-chief. The second point I'd like to make is a point that goes back to the Devenpeck issue, which, as Justice Gorsuch pointed out, might be perfectly sensible in the Fourth Amendment context but not when you're talking about First Amendment values, because First Amendment values are -- the core of the First Amendment is an anti-retaliation principle, and do not be -- do not be fooled.
