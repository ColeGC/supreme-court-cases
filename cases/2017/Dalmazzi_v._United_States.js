Vladeck","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At the heart of these complicated cases is the simple and well-settled distinction between federal officers who are appointed to a second office and those who have been assigned to exercise additional duties germane to their original appointment who hold one office, not two. The dual office-holding ban incorporates this distinction, prohibiting active-duty military officers from holding a second office that requires nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate absent express congressional authorization, while generally allowing military officers to be assigned to exercise the duties of such positions. That's why when the four judges at issue here began to serve as appointed judges on the CMCR, the Court of Military Commission Review, it violated the dual office-holding ban and disqualified them from hearing the Petitioners' appeals. Congress created the Court of Military Commission Review in 2006 as part of the Military Commissions Act, and the initial plan for the CMCR was modeled very much on the then-existing courts of criminal appeals in the court-martial system, right down to how the judges were to be selected.","start":11.8,"stop":84.56,"duration":72.76},{"text":"So, in the original language of the 2006 Act, judges could be assigned by the Secretary of Defense to the CMCR, and those judges could either be civilians or military officers. In 2009, when Congress turned around the CMCR, when Congress decided to make it more independent of the executive branch, one of the measures it pursued was to bifurcate that provision and to break out the assignment of military officers and the appointment of \"additional judges\" by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. And it's our submission that when Congress did so, it created a civil office and it did not expressly authorize military officers to hold that civil office.","start":84.56,"stop":130.8,"duration":46.24},{"text":"That's why when the D.C. Circuit suggested in the Nashiri case that there is a constitutional problem with the assignment of military officers to the CMCR and the President responded by appointing five of those officers, four of whom are relevant here, to that court, it triggered the dual office-holding ban and, in our view, disqualified those officers from continuing to serve --","start":130.8,"stop":153.43,"duration":22.63}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"So are you --","start":153.43,"stop":153.7,"duration":0.27}]},{"speakerName":"Stephen I.

Section 528, Justice Sotomayor, where Congress has said that the CIA director may be a military officer, without any consequence inuring to his military service, without losing his commission, without losing benefits, without losing rank or pay or anything else. The government argues here that the Military Commissions Act itself provides comparable authorization, that Congress when it allowed military officers to be assigned to the CMCR was showing similar approval. And, frankly, again, I think that misstates the distinction between being assigned to exercise additional duties, Congress clearly did authorize military officers to be assigned additional duties as CMCR judges, and being appointed to a second office. There's no language in the Military Commissions Act, especially the provision that refers to the appointment of additional judges, that's Section 950f(b)(3) -- and I apologize for the number of section numbers and acronyms -- there's no language in that provision, Justice Sotomayor, that comes anywhere near suggesting that in 2009 Congress was thinking about military officers when it created this separate appointed office that it was allowing additional judges to hold.","start":510.1,"stop":589.36,"duration":79.26}]},{"speakerName":"Samuel A.

And, Justice Alito, I think it's telling that the Secretary's response, and this is page 18a of the blue brief -- was to delineate eight specific categories of cases where termination of the officer's military status was not to be the consequence, basically reflecting the Vietnam era concerns that the government raised in its brief, identifying circumstances where the -- the remedy for a violation of the statute was not going to be forfeiture of military office.

If I might turn to Justice Breyer's question, with regard to civil office, for us, of course, the key to concluding that an appointed judge on the Court of Military Commission Review holds a civil office is the fact that Congress has created the office by statute, that it exercises the sovereign authority of the United States, and that it can be held and, indeed, is held by civilians.

But to the point that I -- I took your question to be asking about the function, the government makes much of the claim that the Court of Military Commission Review is exercising a classic military function, and I think it's worth stressing it's actually neither classic nor military.

And the purpose of that was not because it was viewed as classically a military function but because Congress was of the view that we needed civilian judges exercising oversight. But one last point, just back to the beginning of the statute, in 1873, three years after the statute was written, the Attorney General concluded that the Secretary of War, who holds about as military an office as I can think of, nevertheless held a civil office for purposes of this very statute.

The Court in Weiss went through the history of the military justice system in the court-martial side of the house and explained the role that military officers had long played in that system, and it concluded that, as a result of that role, serving as a judge on the court of criminal appeals is germane to holding military office. Obviously, the Court in Weiss did not have in front of it Section 973, but we think its conclusion on germaneness is very instructive on this question because the Court of Military Commission Review performs a function that is very similar to the function performed by the courts of criminal appeals. It was expressly patterned on the courts of criminal appeals and the statute defining the circumstances under which it can review a case, 950f.","start":3283.695,"stop":3351.81,"duration":68.11},{"text":"It is drawn almost verbatim from the statute for the courts of criminal appeals, 866. And just as military officers serving on the court of criminal appeals are performing a military function and are doing something that is germane to their military duties, that's also true when those same officers perform essentially the same function in another military court system. And I think what that illustrates, and, by the way, I don't understand my friend to dispute that a judgeship on the court of criminal appeals is a military office, not a civil office of the sort that would be contemplated in Section 973. And what that shows is that even if an office can be held by civilians, as the court of criminal appeals judgeship can be, it is still a military office if it's performing a military function. So judged by that standard, we think Petitioners' claim fails on that first instance because the Court of Military Commission Review is not a civil office. But even if you disagree with us on that question, we also think that Congress has authorized by law military officers to hold a position on the Court of Military Commission Review. And the way that my friend approaches Section 973 is through the lens of assigning and appointing, and he wants to draw a sharp distinction between assigning and appointment and read that distinction into the prohibition in Section 973. But that's not a prohibition that's found in the language or the history of Section 973.","start":3351.81,"stop":3428.4,"duration":76.59},{"text":"Instead, what the statute says is that, \"except as otherwise authorized by law,\" an officer \"may not hold or exercise\" the functions of a civil office.

And Congress then authorized military officers to serve on that court, to hold that office in unambiguous terms, in Section 950f(b)(2), where it said that the Secretary of Defense may assign persons who upheld military judges to be judges on the Court of Military Commission Review. That's how all four of the judges who are at issue here were first placed on the Court of Military Commission Review. Now, it's true the D.C.

We believe that judges can validly serve on the military -- excuse me, military officers can validly serve on the Court of Military Commission Review, but if this Court disagrees, obviously, the government is going to have to fix that problem. So we hope that the Court answers the question presented on the merits and holds that 973(b) does not prevent military officers from serving on the CMCR, but in the event that you disagree with us on that or you don't reach that question, we think also that, as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces held, any violation of Section 973(b) that occurred would not be a basis for invalidating the judges' decisions on the court of criminal appeals. And that's true for at least two reasons. The first is that the Petitioners' argument that it does invalidate their decisions hinges on the premise that automatically upon the acceptance of a prohibited civil office, the relevant officers are ejected from the military. That used to be the way the statute worked, but for good reason Congress changed that.","start":3541.065,"stop":3596.24,"duration":55.17},{"text":"It deleted that automatic termination consequence. Now, when a violation of Section 973 occurs, the government and the officer have to fix it by either giving up the military office or giving up the civil office, but those things happen as a result of administrative action once the violation comes to light, not retroactively and automatically by virtue of the acceptance of the civil office.

Just to briefly address one point on jurisdiction before turning back to the merits, the amicus relies on this Court's decision in Vallandigham.","start":3745.07999995,"stop":3754.22,"duration":9.14},{"text":"I actually think Vallandigham proves the point that both I and Mr. Fletcher were trying to make. The Court in Vallandigham went out of its way to explain why the military commission itself was not \"judicial\" in the sense of Article III. The analogy, of course, to this case would be to the underlying court-martial proceeding and not to the decisions by the courts of criminal appeals or by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Turning to the merits, I think it's important to stress the emptiness of the government's suggestion that it has been engaged in rigorous administrative enforcement of the statute. On its read-in of both Section 973(b)(5) and of the deletion of the automatic termination provision, there is, in fact, no consequence for violating a statute Congress enacted to ensure civilian control of the military, for protecting the civilians' fear of government from having military officers serving in all kinds of positions, and there would be no remedy, especially in a case like this one, where the problem at issue is not a general objection to military officers serving in administrative positions, but a very specific objection to military officers serving as judges. This Court has, for decades, suggested that there are unique separation of powers considerations and there are unique doctrinal and common law reasons to take especially seriously concerns that judges are acting without authority. It's why this Court in both the Ryder case and Nguyen held that the de facto officer doctrine does not apply to immunize at least non-technical violations of judicial assignment rules, and it's why the separation of powers problem we have identified is especially serious in this context. One last point, though, the -- neither -- the government doesn't talk about the -- did not talk about the Commander-in-Chief clause in its merits argument, but I think it's worth stressing just how serious a Commander-in-Chief clause problem a ruling in its favor could create. Under judges who are appointed to the Court of Military Commission Review, under Section 950f(b)(3), serve with good cause removal protection.","start":3754.22,"stop":3869.855,"duration":115.64},{"text":"What that means is if they're military officers, they are insulated from removal by good cause, which, of course, takes them out of the chain of command. Now, rather than suggest that that is a constitutional constraint on the President as Commander-in-Chief, the government argues that, in fact, a judge who is appointed to the CMCR by the President and confirmed by the Senate can be reassigned by the General Counsel of the Department of Defense. There is no suggestion in the Military Commissions Act that Congress intended such a, frankly bizarre, reassignment scheme, and there's no explanation for how that would solve the Commander-in-Chief clause problem. We agree that that question is not squarely presented here because it would only invalidate the ability of these judges to serve on the Court of Military Commission Review. But given that there is a petition for writ of mandamus pending in the D.C. Circuit by two of the defendants in the 9/11 trial, we think it incumbent upon on this Court to reach the merits question and not just rely on the remedies consideration, even if it is inclined to affirm the decisions below.
