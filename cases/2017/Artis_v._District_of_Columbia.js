The question before the Court this morning is, what does it mean for a period of limitations to be tolled? The Court should hold that \"tolled\" means suspended, an interpretation that accords with the plain meaning of the word \"tolled.\" That is the definition given in Black's Law Dictionary, and that is the way \"tolled\" is used in every other statute that uses the word \"tolled,\" none of which would make any sense under Respondent's interpretation.","start":6.52,"stop":46.96,"duration":40.44}]},{"speakerName":"Anthony M.

The Court in that opinion was discussing this old Civil War era statute which stopped the clock, and in the Court's opinion the Court talked about that statute as tolling limitations periods. So, again, that's a pretty weak inference, too, but I just don't see anything in this opinion supporting the view that the Court's decision was dependent on the fact that the statute can only carry the grace period interpretation. I think that -- I have been talking about these, the Jinks case and the statutory history.","start":462.48,"stop":499.24,"duration":36.76},{"text":"I'd like to focus a little bit on the text because I actually think that the text is extremely clear that tolling means suspending. So if I could just make two points about the text.","start":499.24,"stop":508,"duration":8.76},{"text":"The first is that the statute says that the period of limitations shall be tolled.","start":508,"stop":512.36,"duration":4.36},{"text":"Not the statute of limitations, not the limitations bar, the period of limitations. So Respondent's interpretation is that the word tolled means removed.","start":512.36,"stop":521.48,"duration":9.12},{"text":"So that would produce the phrasing, a period of limitations is removed. And that's just improper English.","start":521.48,"stop":527.04,"duration":5.56},{"text":"So just to give an example, suppose Congress were enacting a statute in which it said that the bar associated with filing suit in a particular place was lifted, so, you know, the Court of Federal Claims or something. The statute would never say that the Court of Federal Claims is removed.","start":527.04,"stop":541.72,"duration":14.68},{"text":"It would say that the bar associated with filing suit in the Court of Federal Claims is removed. And likewise here, the statute does not say that the bar is removed.","start":541.72,"stop":550.12,"duration":8.4},{"text":"It says that -- excuse me, is tolled.","start":550.12,"stop":551.6,"duration":1.48},{"text":"It says that the period of limitations is tolled and, therefore, we think that is only consistent with an interpretation that means suspended. So even in the abstract the word toll can carry different meanings.","start":551.6,"stop":560.92,"duration":9.32},{"text":"We don't think that's consistent with tolling the period of limitations. And I think that the other textual point I'd like to make is that the period of limitations is tolled for two distinct periods: while the claim is pending in federal court and for a period of 30 days after it's dismissed. And we don't think that that interpretation is in any way consistent with construing tolled to mean removed because you don't need the tolling while the claim is pending in federal court if tolled, in fact, means removed.","start":560.92,"stop":588.76,"duration":27.84},{"text":"You only need the 30 days. And, in fact, the concept of removing a statute of limitations while a claim is pending in federal court is -- is incoherent. The statute of limitations is completely irrelevant when you have a presumably timely claim that's already been filed. And so, therefore, we think that the -- the correct interpretation is to say that the clock stops, which is perfectly consistent with the fact that the statute defines the tolling period as both the pendency of the federal claim and 30 days thereafter. And just one other comment about the fact that the period of limitations is tolled while the claim is pending in federal court. So, if the statute just said that, if the statute just said the period of limitations is pending -- is tolled while the claim is pending in federal court, period, full stop, then I think there would be no debate as to what it means.","start":588.76,"stop":634.68,"duration":45.92},{"text":"I think we'd all agree that it means that the clock is suspended. So Respondent's position is essentially that by increasing the length of the tolling period, by adding 30 days, that radically changes what tolling means.","start":634.68,"stop":646.16,"duration":11.48},{"text":"It changes the meaning of tolling from stops the clock to continues the clock.","start":646.16,"stop":649.92,"duration":3.76},{"text":"And that's just not the way the Court reads statutes. Tolled means what it means.","start":649.92,"stop":653.64,"duration":3.72},{"text":"If toll -- the tolling length -- excuse me, if the period of tolling is shorter, then -- then you have a shorter period, and if it's longer, then you have a longer period of tolling, but increasing the tolling period doesn't alter what it means to toll a period of limitations.

Unikowsky","textObjs":[{"text":"So I don't actually think that there is.","start":684,"stop":685.92,"duration":1.92},{"text":"So Respondent cites some dictionaries that talk about the word \"tolled\" meaning \"remove.\" But I don't think that really advances the ball very much because it seems to me that on both sides, in some sense the statute of limitations or the limitations bar is being removed. The question is, what's the precise mechanism behind which the limitations bar is removed? And so Respondent's position is that the clock keeps running while the period of limitations is tolled, and I have been unable to find any dictionary or any case that understands the word tolling that way. And so, therefore, I understand that in the abstract, toll, especially in the context of, for instance, rights of entry, which is a definition offered by Respondent, might mean remove.","start":685.92,"stop":724.48,"duration":38.56},{"text":"But in the context of statutes of limitations, the concept of the clock continuing to run while the period of limitations is tolled seems to me completely alien to the law.","start":724.48,"stop":733.2,"duration":8.72},{"text":"I haven't seen any statute or any case understanding the word tolling that way.","start":733.2,"stop":736.4,"duration":3.2}]},{"speakerName":"Samuel A.

And so I think the question is, is this tolling -- can Congress elect to use a suspension approach rather than a grace period approach? I think the answer is yes, because all members of the Court have agreed that Congress gets some degree of latitude on how to implement its enumerated powers. There is some debate among the members of the Court in the Comstock case about how much latitude, but everyone agrees that there is some latitude.","start":779.28,"stop":807.12,"duration":27.84},{"text":"So I think we have a very modest position here under the necessary and proper clause.
