Fitzgerald","textObjs":[{"text":"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The warrant requirement for the home and curtilage cannot be overthrown by the automobile exception. Under the Commonwealth's argument, on probable cause alone, an officer may search a vehicle anywhere that he finds it and may go anywhere that he needs to in order to access that vehicle. That rule cannot survive foundational Fourth Amendment principles.","start":7.12,"stop":37.24,"duration":30.12},{"text":"Searches of the home and curtilage without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable, as this Court has often recognized. So the rule we ask this Court to adopt is that the automobile exception does not apply to a vehicle found in the curtilage of the home.","start":37.24,"stop":54.72,"duration":17.48}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Suppose the -- the police have probable cause to believe that the vehicle is stolen and they even get a warrant to inspect the vehicle.","start":54.72,"stop":73.04,"duration":18.32},{"text":"But the vehicle is parked in this port.

Fitzgerald","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, Your Honor, the -- the warrant would specify the place to be searched for the car.","start":90.92,"stop":95.84,"duration":4.92},{"text":"And so, commonly, a warrant would say, for instance, the dwelling and curtilage to look for this motorcycle.","start":95.84,"stop":102.64,"duration":6.8},{"text":"So the warrant that authorizes the search of the motorcycle would, by its terms, authorize the intrusion into the curtilage to look for --","start":102.64,"stop":109.16,"duration":6.52}]},{"speakerName":"Samuel A.

Fitzgerald","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, Your Honor, the Fourth Amendment, by its terms, requires a warrant to specify the place to be searched.

But that's not really the question here because there is probable cause, and there is the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement.","start":165.32,"stop":183.4,"duration":18.08},{"text":"So the issue is not whether there was a search.","start":183.4,"stop":186.04,"duration":2.64},{"text":"Yes, there was a search.","start":186.04,"stop":187.68,"duration":1.64},{"text":"And, yes, you know, if it -- if it was the curtilage, then there was -- there -- there was an intrusion on the protected area.

It's a balancing.","start":205.68,"stop":230.92,"duration":25.24},{"text":"It's not a consideration of whether it's on the curtilage or not.","start":230.92,"stop":234.64,"duration":3.72},{"text":"And it's hard to see why the balance is any different here than it would be if this motorcycle had been parked on the street.","start":234.64,"stop":243.64,"duration":9},{"text":"The -- the risk that it will be moved seems to be almost exactly the same.","start":243.64,"stop":248.44,"duration":4.8},{"text":"And what -- what is the additional invasion of privacy? The invasion of privacy that's involved in walking a few feet up a driveway, and the home is not even Mr. Byrd's home.","start":248.44,"stop":261.96,"duration":13.52},{"text":"Why does the balance come out different here?","start":261.96,"stop":264.72,"duration":2.76}]},{"speakerName":"Matthew A. Fitzgerald","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, Your Honor, so here's -- here's the way that I think about that: If you're looking at the terms that support the automobile exception, you have ready mobility and you have the lessened expectation of privacy.

So the motorcycle here is five feet from the side of the house.","start":332.64,"stop":345.48,"duration":12.84},{"text":"And -- and to the extent that curtilage is at issue, curtilage has been waived by the Commonwealth by not arguing it below.","start":345.48,"stop":354,"duration":8.52},{"text":"And this is a clear case for curtilage, given the distance from the house.

The first is the intrusion into the curtilage under Jardines, which is clearly a search outside of any implied license, and the second is the removal of the cover from the motorcycle, which is similar to opening a container to find a vehicle inside or perhaps opening the door to a car or removing a cover from a car.","start":383.08,"stop":403.48,"duration":20.4}]},{"speakerName":"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","textObjs":[{"text":"So if this motorcycle were parked on the street and it was covered by a tarp, you would say that the motor vehicle exception doesn't apply because it's covered by a tarp?","start":403.48,"stop":412.4,"duration":8.92}]},{"speakerName":"Matthew A.
