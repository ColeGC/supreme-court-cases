arrangement within the context of a franchise system.","start":39.903,"stop":47.452,"duration":7.55},{"text":"Carvel, the respondents are the franchise source of a chain of soft ice cream stores, roadside stores, stores which serve the general public.","start":47.452,"stop":61.237,"duration":13.79},{"text":"They have licensed approximately 400 such stores, approximately 250 of which are located in the area about which we're primarily concerned.","start":61.237,"stop":74.297,"duration":13.06},{"text":"These stores are of interest to the independent businessman, the independent businessman who wants to be his own boss, who wants to be on his own.","start":74.297,"stop":87.29,"duration":12.99},{"text":"When Carvel went into the franchising business, is -- it undertook a very strong campaign to publicize the values and qualities of its franchise.","start":87.29,"stop":100.496,"duration":13.21},{"text":"These values were constantly repeated in daily newspapers.","start":100.496,"stop":105.962,"duration":5.47},{"text":"They appeared in television and we have a very brief outline of them on page 7 of our reply brief -- oh, page 6 on the reply brief.","start":105.962,"stop":117.97,"duration":12.01},{"text":"These items are the ones which we consider to be the essential ones to the value of the franchise.","start":117.97,"stop":128.045,"duration":10.07},{"text":"They are -- and this is what the independent businessman who wants to become a Carvel franchisee since they are the expert guidance which the franchisor can furnish.","start":128.045,"stop":143.137,"duration":15.09},{"text":"They are the good location and they are the recipes and the techniques that make for success.","start":143.137,"stop":150.945,"duration":7.81},{"text":"As a matter of fact, Carvel has very well publicized that and -- one of the exhibits introduced in this case by Carvel specifically refers to it.","start":150.945,"stop":163.038,"duration":12.09},{"text":"It is on page 427 in the lower left-hand corner, where Carvel describes the merits of its soft ice cream chain.","start":163.038,"stop":173.964,"duration":10.93},{"text":"It's a very small print.","start":173.964,"stop":175.847,"duration":1.88},{"text":"Now, this is the value of this chain, the businessman has the amicus curiae put it -- get a running start if he becomes a part of a franchise organization.","start":175.847,"stop":193.121,"duration":17.27},{"text":"This is what these individuals who were looking forward to becoming successful businessmen sought when they became franchise operators.","start":193.121,"stop":204.726,"duration":11.6},{"text":"Now, unlike some of the franchises which are occurring in this country, Carvel has envisioned the right to operate the soft ice cream stores which it wants to franchise to the individual operators.","start":204.726,"stop":225.264,"duration":20.54},{"text":"And the expert guidance which the applicant for a franchise seeks, not only on the payment of a royalty which is the usual and customary way but also on an agreement to purchase almost all of its commissary goods and supplies and equipment which the dealer needs in this everyday operation of his business.","start":225.264,"stop":251.815,"duration":26.55},{"text":"Thus, the applicant has no choice if he wants a Carvel franchise.","start":251.815,"stop":256.956,"duration":5.14},{"text":"He must buy frantically all of his commissary goods from Carvel.","start":256.956,"stop":264.696,"duration":7.74},{"text":"Now, if we look at this problem in a broad sense, we see that there is a tying arrangement between the item which is desirable, unique and attractive to the applicant, the things that make for business success.","start":264.696,"stop":287.556,"duration":22.86},{"text":"And which are perhaps accompanied by certain things like the Carvel name and reputation, by Carvel's way of doing business and even perhaps by the appearance of the Carvel stores in the way they have uniqueness in their qualities.","start":287.556,"stop":305.361,"duration":17.81},{"text":"Now, these are the items which draw the franchiser -- franchisee to Carvel.","start":305.361,"stop":313.177,"duration":7.82},{"text":"And this is the element.","start":313.177,"stop":316.026,"duration":2.85},{"text":"This is the focus of the tying arrangement.","start":316.026,"stop":319.567,"duration":3.54},{"text":"This interpretation of the tying arrangement does not differ very substantially from the position taken by Chief Justice Lumbard in the Second Circuit.","start":319.567,"stop":332.444,"duration":12.88},{"text":"It is almost the same.","start":332.444,"stop":334.433,"duration":1.99},{"text":"But, I think the emphasis is placed somewhat differently.","start":334.433,"stop":338.698,"duration":4.26},{"text":"It is also essentially the same view which was taken in a similar case, not part of this proceeding by the Federal Trade Commission examiner who heard evidence.","start":338.698,"stop":350.724,"duration":12.03},{"text":"In both cases and the Court and the Federal Trade Commission found a tying arrangement.","start":350.724,"stop":358.746,"duration":8.02},{"text":"And Judge Lumbard in his opinion found an illegal tying arrangement.","start":358.746,"stop":364.146,"duration":5.4},{"text":"The concurrent -- the majority opinion of Judges Friendly and Medina is actually in agreement on this point.","start":364.146,"stop":375.727,"duration":11.58},{"text":"I think the Court as an entirety finds a tying arrangement.","start":375.727,"stop":379.326,"duration":3.6},{"text":"The only difference on which the result comes out, the only way the result differs is that the majority refers to the fact that Carvel plaintiffs, the plaintiffs in the case below, the petitioners here, entered into a stipulation by which they agreed to limit themselves to the per se violations of the antitrust laws as far as proof was concerned.","start":379.326,"stop":411.956,"duration":32.63},{"text":"As a matter of fact, it actually wasn't as far as proof was concerned they said that they were going to rely on the per se violations.","start":411.956,"stop":419.34,"duration":7.38},{"text":"It was evidently their position that this Court's opinions and laws and also in Northern Pacific made it very clear that this was one of the most pernicious forms of tying arrangements.","start":419.34,"stop":435.22,"duration":15.88},{"text":"This kind of tying arrangement that -- which we speak here, Your Honor, is not the kind of tying arrangement which means a purchase of an initial inventory tied to a certain values in the purchase of franchise.","start":435.22,"stop":454.299,"duration":19.08},{"text":"This is not what we're referring to.","start":454.299,"stop":456.191,"duration":1.89},{"text":"This is a tying arrangement for the commissary goods for the life of the franchise.","start":456.191,"stop":463.518,"duration":7.33},{"text":"In doing this, in tying this, the commissary goods to the franchise, for the entire life of the franchise, not only is the competitive supplier excluded from the market of 400 Carvel dealers, who according to stipulated figures, buy approximately four and half million dollars worth of goods substantially more than were involved in the International Salt case.","start":463.518,"stop":499.967,"duration":36.45},{"text":"And we feel that a substantial market is as to the result tied and controlled.","start":499.967,"stop":510.014,"duration":10.05},{"text":"From this, I think it can be concluded that there is tremendous value in the tying item.","start":510.014,"stop":520.453,"duration":10.44},{"text":"And the tying item as Judge Lumbard put it, consists not only of the items which I feel attract the ordinary businessman who knows nothing about patents and copyrights and trademarks and machines.","start":520.453,"stop":536.404,"duration":15.95},{"text":"He only knows about this is an advertised -- this makes for success 21 years without a business failure.","start":536.404,"stop":545.896,"duration":9.49},{"text":"We have served the soft ice cream industry since 1934 succeed with Carvel.","start":545.896,"stop":557.531,"duration":11.63},{"text":"And it's almost an underwritten promise that this franchise will give success.","start":557.531,"stop":564.79,"duration":7.26},{"text":"This is an attitude which I think overwhelms an applicant and makes it easy for him to acquiesce in this type of arrangement.","start":564.79,"stop":576.777,"duration":11.99},{"text":"And in an acquiescing in this kind of arrangement, he not only puts himself in the position of agreeing to purchase these commissary goods for the period of his business experience with Carvel.","start":576.777,"stop":592.09,"duration":15.31},{"text":"But, he also puts himself in the position where he must, if he ever violates the law -- the rules set forth in the franchise agreement.","start":592.09,"stop":603.622,"duration":11.53},{"text":"If he ever violates by buying from a competitor, a national biscuit company and other large companies have very anxiously solicited the business of this Carvel dealers.","start":603.622,"stop":616.786,"duration":13.16},{"text":"If he ever violates this rule, he is in a position where he may be forced to give up his business with a loss of a substantial part of his investment.","start":616.786,"stop":629.276,"duration":12.49},{"text":"In fact, most of his investment, depending on what the year is in which this franchise is terminated.","start":629.276,"stop":638.261,"duration":8.99},{"text":"And as a result of that, he is not only restricted in his freedom to compete in the marketplace for -- with -- he is not only restricted in obtaining price concessions from suppliers, he is completely eliminated.","start":638.261,"stop":660.125,"duration":21.86},{"text":"He is completely made a part of the Carvel organization.","start":660.125,"stop":665.755,"duration":5.63},{"text":"True and this is Judge -- what Judge Lumbard recognizes.","start":665.755,"stop":669.224,"duration":3.47},{"text":"There is price competition on the sup -- on the Carvel level.","start":669.224,"stop":673.7,"duration":4.48},{"text":"Carvel gets the price concessions but if the Carvel dealer had available to him the opportunity of dealing with more than one supplier, there would be no problem because he too would get price concessions.","start":673.7,"stop":690.352,"duration":16.65},{"text":"Now, if he violates this part of the franchise agreement and his agreement is terminated, or if his franchise is not renewed, he'd not only exclude it from the business area for a short period of time, he's excluded from an area of 25 miles for a period of five years.","start":690.352,"stop":712.53,"duration":22.18},{"text":"This is a very, very severe restriction and one which I think will cause an owner of a franchise to think twice before he will violate the franchise terms.","start":712.53,"stop":727.57,"duration":15.04},{"text":"Now in discussing the aspects of what happens to the suppliers, we have not only to take into consideration the suppliers which supply Carvel.","start":727.57,"stop":745.359,"duration":17.79},{"text":"But, other suppliers would do equally well and will do equally well in supplying the needs of Carvel dealers.","start":745.359,"stop":754.243,"duration":8.88},{"text":"It should be noted that Eagle Cone Corporation which does business in the State of Pennsylvania is not permitted to sell to Carvel dealers the very same cones which it can sell to Connecticut dealers, which it can sell to Massachusetts dealers, because in Pennsylvania this is the area of the Illinois Baking Company.","start":754.243,"stop":781.091,"duration":26.85},{"text":"Now, for a practical -- in a practical sense, I -- the supplier actually deals with the dealer.","start":781.091,"stop":792.808,"duration":11.72},{"text":"It's only in the form in which the agreement is cast that Carvel is the supplier at all, that dealer gives his order to the supplier and I note that there are different suppliers with different things, different suppliers with dairy product, different suppliers for ice cream cones.","start":792.808,"stop":813.878,"duration":21.07},{"text":"He gets his order to these suppliers.","start":813.878,"stop":816.67,"duration":2.79},{"text":"The suppliers deliver them to him.","start":816.67,"stop":819.753,"duration":3.08},{"text":"They invoice him on a bill which was prepared and printed at the request of Carvel on a Carvel letterhead.","start":819.753,"stop":828.282,"duration":8.53},{"text":"And that even in most instances collect payments from the dealer.","start":828.282,"stop":834.1,"duration":5.82},{"text":"In other words, the dealers are in effect dealing with the supplier without having the benefits which come with price competition.","start":834.1,"stop":848.116,"duration":14.02},{"text":"They were permitted to deal with the other suppliers who could very easily and are capable of furnishing these very same supplies as indicated by the fact that Carvel doesn't just deal with Rakestraw and Hood, it deals with a number of other dairies in the large area.","start":848.116,"stop":870.585,"duration":22.47},{"text":"It doesn't just deal with Eagle Cone.","start":870.585,"stop":872.356,"duration":1.77},{"text":"It deals with other suppliers of cones in other
