case.","start":12.998,"stop":18.15,"duration":5.15},{"text":"The respondent here is an Industrial Corporation which in 1952, 1953, and 1954 advanced large sums of money to financial institutions such as the Commercial Credit Company and CIT in exchange for notes of those Institutions.","start":18.15,"stop":37.309,"duration":19.16},{"text":"The notes, 13 in number were all payable in less than a year.","start":37.309,"stop":43.058,"duration":5.75},{"text":"While they did not in terms provide for the payment of interest, all were issued at a discount, usually, between 2.0% and 2.5%, on an annual basis, the notes were typically in face amounts of $1 million or $2 million.","start":43.058,"stop":60.037,"duration":16.98},{"text":"In each instance, the respondents sold the note to a bank a few days prior to its maturity, realizing a total gain of about $280,000, all of which was attributable to the discount at which they were originally issued.","start":60.037,"stop":76.361,"duration":16.32},{"text":"Taxpayer reported this gain on its tax returns as capital gain.","start":76.361,"stop":83.909,"duration":7.55},{"text":"Commission had determined however, that the excess of the face amount of the notes over the amount at which they were issued represented interest, and since the notes were also within the taxable year, he treated the entire gain realized on the sale of the notes as ordinary income.","start":83.909,"stop":101.889,"duration":17.98},{"text":"Now, I should note parenthetically here that Midland-Ross, like Dixon and the lot like the Dixon, petitioners in the last case, were on the accrual basis and therefore, logically, they should have been required to accrue the interest as it was earned prior to the sales, but since -- and irrespective of whether the notes were sold or not.","start":101.889,"stop":124.001,"duration":22.11},{"text":"But since in this case, the notes were all in fact sold within the tax year, the result is exactly the same whether you treat them as having accrued the interest as it was earned or simply as having realized the interest upon the sale of the notes.","start":124.001,"stop":142.909,"duration":18.91},{"text":"The respondent paid the resulting deficiencies and brought suit for refund.","start":142.909,"stop":147.296,"duration":4.39},{"text":"The District Court held that the gain was all capital gain and the Sixth Circuit affirmed per curiam, citing its earlier decision on the Caulkins case.","start":147.296,"stop":160.543,"duration":13.25},{"text":"Here as in Dixon, the taxpayer does not seriously dispute the fact that discount and stated interested are in substance identical.","start":160.543,"stop":170.248,"duration":9.7},{"text":"The taxpayer argues though that Congress intended that it nonetheless to be treated differently.","start":170.248,"stop":176.082,"duration":5.83},{"text":"The argument I think goes something like this.","start":176.082,"stop":179.194,"duration":3.11},{"text":"Prior to 1954, it was the practice of the Internal Revenue Service to treat original issued discount differently from interest and to treat it as a capital item upon the sale of the notes.","start":179.194,"stop":194.003,"duration":14.81},{"text":"That this practice was confirmed by a 1927 decision of the Board of Tax Appeal, and was impliedly ratified by Congress through its failure to enact a general statute authorizing equality of treatment or the same treatment for interest and discount and we think that this presents a holy misleading picture of the pre-1954 law.","start":194.003,"stop":217.881,"duration":23.88},{"text":"But before getting to that, I’d like to point out preliminarily, within view of the admittedly irrational results for which the respondent contends, it would require nothing less than the clearest statutory or judicial authority to justify that result.","start":217.881,"stop":237.799,"duration":19.92},{"text":"Prior to 1954, apart from the Caulkins case which I’ve already discussed, there was no decision by this Court, by any Court of Appeals or even by any Federal District Court which even dealt with the treatment of original issue discount on the lender’s side and as I’ve suggested, all of the cases on the borrower’s side treated it as interest, most of them.","start":237.799,"stop":261.826,"duration":24.03},{"text":"There are to be sure a number of administrative rulings and decisions for the Board of Tax Appeal on the treatment of discount on the lender’s side, but these are aligned on both sides of the question, some of them treating discount as interest, others treating it differently.","start":261.826,"stop":278.679,"duration":16.85},{"text":"The fact to the matter is, that prior to 1954 when Congress provided a solution for the matter, there simply was no general rule, no general administrative practice as to the treatment of original issue discount.","start":278.679,"stop":293.537,"duration":14.86},{"text":"At most, there were a number of special rules and special practices dealing with particular types of taxpayers, particular types of securities and particular aspects of the tax treatment.","start":293.537,"stop":307.096,"duration":13.56},{"text":"One commentator writing in 1940 in the North Carolina Law Review, summarized the situation as it existed then in the following terms.","start":307.096,"stop":317.767,"duration":10.67},{"text":"“Present federal practices involve on the surface at least a welter of theoretical inconsistencies.","start":317.767,"stop":324.148,"duration":6.38},{"text":"Both administrators and judges have contributed to the State of Affairs and neither the Administrators nor the Board of Tax Appeals, nor the Federal Courts have ever undertaken a complete analysis of all these inconsistent practices in an attempt to show if or how they can be justified in relation to each other.”","start":324.148,"stop":342.498,"duration":18.35},{"text":"So I don’t think it accurate to say that it was the Commissioner’s position prior to 1954 that original issue discount was a capital item to be differentiated from interest.","start":342.498,"stop":354.192,"duration":11.69},{"text":"Now, a detailed analysis of this rather complicated history doesn’t lend itself very well to oral argument and we discuss it I think fully in our brief.","start":354.192,"stop":364.549,"duration":10.36},{"text":"I would like to summarize those, some of the principle strands on the tapestry.","start":364.549,"stop":369.716,"duration":5.17},{"text":"First of all as I’ve indicated, the cases almost from the beginning held that original issue discount was deductible as interest by the borrower, the issuer.","start":369.716,"stop":381.364,"duration":11.65},{"text":"Secondly, in the case of tax exempt state and municipal securities, it was recognized again almost from the very beginning that discount at which these exempt securities were issued would tantamount to interest and therefore, it too was made tax exempt.","start":381.364,"stop":401.56,"duration":20.2},{"text":"This was not the result of statute I might underscore as it sometimes suggested, there was no federal statute dealing with the treatment of original issue discount on state and municipal securities.","start":401.56,"stop":413.125,"duration":11.56},{"text":"The same solution was adopted by statute, however, with respect to Federal Treasury notes as early as 1929, the statute providing that the discount at which these non-interest bearing notes were issued should be considered as interest.","start":413.125,"stop":429.147,"duration":16.02},{"text":"Even after that statutory exemption was removed, moreover, the Administrator continued to apply the principle that discounts was the same as interest with respect to these securities, because they issued a ruling requiring that this discount now be treated as taxable interest and amortized as such by the lending.","start":429.147,"stop":453.449,"duration":24.3},{"text":"Thirdly, the rule with respect to bond discount was that discount was equivalent to interest and was to be treated as such.","start":453.449,"stop":463.576,"duration":10.13},{"text":"That is, when a bond -- when a bank – excuse me, I said bond discount, I meant bank discount.","start":463.576,"stop":469.098,"duration":5.52},{"text":"When a bank lends money by purchasing the short-term of non-interest bearing note of a borrower, say he purchases for a $100, a $106 note from the borrower, that $6 increment has always been treated by the Commissioner as equivalent of interest and the bank has been required to accrue it as an interest if it was on the accrual basis.","start":469.098,"stop":497.766,"duration":28.67},{"text":"Now I think this is significant because the kind of short-term non-interest bearing notes which was the subject of the rulings on bank discount are very, very similar in character to the short-term non-interest bearing notes involved in this case.","start":497.766,"stop":511.79,"duration":14.02}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Now in the example you just gave, the bank, what -- what’s the rule if the bank is not on the accrual basis?","start":511.79,"stop":517.922,"duration":6.13}]},{"speakerName":"Frank I. Goodman","textObjs":[{"text":"If the bank is not on the accrual basis then, as any other cash basis taxpayers, it’s not required to account for the interest as it is earned over the life of the security, but (Voice Overlap) --","start":517.922,"stop":530.992,"duration":13.07}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"In the -- any year of the material note --","start":530.992,"stop":531.706,"duration":0.71}]},{"speakerName":"Frank I.

Goodman","textObjs":[{"text":"There would be no question about that in any event, but that wasn’t the reason for the rulings.","start":542.054,"stop":546.907,"duration":4.85},{"text":"It’s quite clear if you read it, the 1925 ruling which is referred to and I think quoted in our brief, is simply that is an economic matter, interest and discount would be the same (Voice Overlap) -- nothing is said about the bank’s paying in business.","start":546.907,"stop":558.952,"duration":12.04}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"That reason is clear I suppose but nonetheless as you say it, it’s like a person -- the real estate dealer, he doesn’t get the ordinary event because it’s a capital gains available of a case and also as a real estate.","start":558.952,"stop":568.919,"duration":9.97}]},{"speakerName":"Frank I. Goodman","textObjs":[{"text":"That’s right, but the ruling didn’t pertain to the treatment of the sale of a notes, whether it would be capital gain or ordinary income.","start":568.919,"stop":575.425,"duration":6.51},{"text":"It pertains to whether or not it has to be amortized.","start":575.425,"stop":578.264,"duration":2.84},{"text":"And on that question the Court said, this is the interest and like interest, it should be accrued.","start":578.264,"stop":586.512,"duration":8.25},{"text":"Now there is authority that the Commissioner took a different view, there is some evidence that the Commissioner took a different view as to bond discount.","start":586.512,"stop":595.54,"duration":9.03},{"text":"A 1920 ruling cited by Midland-Ross and also a 1927 decision of the Board of Tax Appeal held that bond discount was not required to be accrued by the lender even though it was accruable by the issuer.","start":595.54,"stop":615.927,"duration":20.39},{"text":"It’s not entirely clear from those holdings whether the Commissioner or whether the Board of Tax Appeals had in mind original issue discount or only market discount, which of course would be the most prevalent form of discount on corporate bonds.","start":615.927,"stop":633.645,"duration":17.72},{"text":"It’s also I would note, neither of these authorities says anything about question of capital gain or ordinary income upon the sale or redemption of the bond.","start":633.645,"stop":646.709,"duration":13.06},{"text":"So, that there was a differentiation in treatment apparently between the discount on corporate bonds and the discount on short-term non-interest-bearing notes.","start":646.709,"stop":657.933,"duration":11.22},{"text":"I don’t think it’s fair to say that the rule with respect to corporate bonds was the general rule, while all of the other strands of treatment that I’ve discussed represented some sort of out of the way exceptions.","start":657.933,"stop":669.935,"duration":12},{"text":"There simply was no general rule and if anything, the type of securities involved in the present case are much closer to the short-term notes involving the bank holding and the bank rulings than they are to corporate bonds.","start":669.935,"stop":685.354,"duration":15.42},{"text":"There is I think an explanation for the differentiation of treatment between bonds and other forms of securities, or at least between interest-bearing and short -- and the non-interest-bearing securities.","start":685.354,"stop":699.562,"duration":14.21},{"text":"Corporate bonds are typically interest-bearing in character, the discount or premium element usually is very, very small.","start":699.562,"stop":708.238,"duration":8.68},{"text":"It’s not intended as a substitute for the whole of the interest as it was in this case.","start":708.238,"stop":713.085,"duration":4.85},{"text":"Usually, it represents a last-minute adjustment to conditions on the market place on the date of issue.","start":713.085,"stop":719.188,"duration":6.1},{"text":"A second feature of bonds is the fact that they are relevantly long-term in character or long-term and therefore, change hands frequently on the marketplace before their redemption.","start":719.188,"stop":730.59,"duration":11.4},{"text":"Now, a number of implications flow from these distinctions between bonds and short-term non-interest-bearing securities such as, have been held to give rise to interest, the discount element has been held equal to interest.","start":730.59,"stop":746.718,"duration":16.13},{"text":"In the first place, since the discount is very small usually in the case of corporate bond, it may have been thought that it just wasn’t worth bothering about, it wasn’t worth requiring the burdens and computations in order to account for it as interest.","start":746.718,"stop":761.19,"duration":14.47},{"text":"It may also have been thought, that because the banks -- because the bonds change hands frequently during their life, it was unduly burdensome to require each successive holder to ascertain what the original discounts have been and to account for it.","start":761.19,"stop":776.659,"duration":15.47},{"text":"These problems didn’t arise in the case of short-term notes which bore no interest.","start":776.659,"stop":781.938,"duration":5.28},{"text":"Also, I think it quite probable that the equivalence, the economic equivalence of interest and discount was much more obvious in the case of non-interest-bearing notes than it was in the case of interest-bearing bonds which did carry a stated rate of interest and where you had to say that wasn’t the real interest.","start":781.938,"stop":799.634,"duration":17.7},{"text":"What they said was the interest, wasn’t the real interest because of the discounted premium element.","start":799.634,"stop":805.102,"duration":5.47},{"text":"I think that this goes far towards explaining also the differentiation of treatment between premium and discount.","start":805.102,"stop":811.365,"duration":6.26},{"text":"Premium is invariably associated with interest-bearing securities and the fact that the Court has been reluctant to say that the nominal interest rate wasn’t the real interest rate, doesn’t necessarily mean that it would have been -- but it would have said where you had a completely non-interest-bearing security, this security has no interest at all.","start":811.365,"stop":829.46,"duration":18.1}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you really think that these differentiations are explainable just in terms of the inability to get beyond the forced rate of interest because this is certainly, it doesn’t take much sophistication?","start":829.46,"stop":842.385,"duration":12.92},{"text":"I don’t know

1232.","start":1832.57,"stop":1861.191,"duration":28.62},{"text":"Just last year, Congress indicated again the same understanding of these principles when it decided that as to certain of the

followed the pattern of that -- of the type of obligations that were originally subject to that tax and they broadened it somewhat, but have not extended it to individuals and I suppose where the

ordinary income of $2.97 and a capital loss.","start":2186.679,"stop":2221.276,"duration":34.6},{"text":"Now, Section 1232 doesn’t say that, it says very clearly that to the extent there was a gains
