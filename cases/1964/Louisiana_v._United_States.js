us.","start":60.698,"stop":84.162,"duration":23.46},{"text":"Louisiana has voluntarily abandoned that old discriminatory device and has now enacted a brand new, uniform, written, objective test which is unexceptional.","start":84.162,"stop":97.764,"duration":13.6},{"text":"As to the past, they say, let us forgive and forget now that the State has began a fresh apparently in good faith using a

old.","start":260.86,"stop":269.587,"duration":8.73},{"text":"Even the Board of Registration whose discretion in this matter may be questioned has not explicitly directed registrars to stop using the

with respect to this test.","start":337.312,"stop":342.644,"duration":5.33},{"text":"For a long time it was apparently viewed as purely optional up to any registrar to use it as it saw fit.","start":342.644,"stop":348.896,"duration":6.25},{"text":"In 1956 through 1961, Louisiana officials or some of them at the highest state level took the position that the test was mandatory and that any registrar who declined to use it was subject to removal and even to criminal prosecution.","start":348.896,"stop":367.137,"duration":18.24},{"text":"So, Louisiana has blown hot and cold on this issue of whether the test is in fact subject to being shelved.","start":367.137,"stop":379.162,"duration":12.02},{"text":"Even now, it is possible to purge a voter who prior to 1962 was allegedly registered without taking the test on the ground that the test was then enforced and that he was therefore illegally registered.","start":379.162,"stop":400.157,"duration":21},{"text":"Indeed that is the suggestion made for Negroes as to whites who were registered without taking the test.","start":400.157,"stop":408.051,"duration":7.89},{"text":"In short, the test if it was valid has the continuing effect in that respect.","start":408.051,"stop":414.919,"duration":6.87},{"text":"Now, under existing circumstances, as I say, there can be no assurance with the test will not be revived at some later time or some other administration in some parishes if not at all.","start":414.919,"stop":429.367,"duration":14.45},{"text":"Negroes not without reason will continue to be deterred by the

future.","start":429.367,"stop":444.362,"duration":15},{"text":"They are entitled to have the registrars stripped of this weapon altogether.","start":444.362,"stop":457.054,"duration":12.69},{"text":"Therefore, the general injunction issued by the court below against the interpretation test, against the use of the

reason why we cannot erase the interpretation test from the case and that is because the discrimination it accomplished has not been erased in fact and cannot be erased without further relief, which
