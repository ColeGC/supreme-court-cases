Amendment.","start":562.92,"stop":571.273,"duration":8.35},{"text":"The other two seemed to me really to be quite simple.","start":571.273,"stop":576.063,"duration":4.79},{"text":"Indeed the argument that this bill of attainder or ex post facto law I think is frivolous.","start":576.063,"stop":582.78,"duration":6.72},{"text":"At the outset therefore, I shall direct myself to the issue of pre -- freedom of speech and freedom of association and deal with the latter points on the labor.","start":582.78,"stop":596.243,"duration":13.46},{"text":"In dealing with the issue whether the statute violates the First Amendment, I want to emphasize at the outset two propositions which I think are incontrovertible.","start":596.243,"stop":610.545,"duration":14.3},{"text":"The first is that absent the limitations imposed by the Bill of Rights, Section 504 would plainly be a valid exercise of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.","start":610.545,"stop":623.823,"duration":13.28},{"text":"Having chosen to support and promote collective bargaining as a means of encouraging the free flow of commerce and protecting the rights of employees, Congress was certainly entitled to take steps to prevent abuse of the power thus conferred on the union by limiting the likelihood that their energies would be diverted away from any normal trade union purposes to the disadvantage of the public and to the disadvantage of union members.","start":623.823,"stop":659.58,"duration":35.76},{"text":"To give one specific illustration that it's only one, the exclusion of members of the Communist Party from office in labor unions is a way of reducing the likelihood of political strikes which would not only disrupt commerce, interfere with the public welfare, but also cause losses to union members without any commensurate hope of economic benefits and might well weaken and destroy the unions and impair their ability to perform the functions that the National Labor Policy gives.","start":659.58,"stop":696.782,"duration":37.2},{"text":"The interest in that diversion of union energy, as we say, and the resulting injuries to the public and to the union members certainly matters within the legitimate scope of governmental concern, the legitimate scope of legislative concern.","start":696.782,"stop":716.507,"duration":19.72},{"text":"I should also emphasize in this connection that there's nothing noble about the approach of Section 504 although of course as we shall see in a moment it comes closer to affecting freedom of speech and freedom of association than it's analyzed.","start":716.507,"stop":733.275,"duration":16.77},{"text":"But the principle that a man shall not serve two masters or attempt to serve two masters, is a very old one.","start":733.275,"stop":741.637,"duration":8.36},{"text":"The common law recognized the evil in man's occupying dual positions in which they would be subject to conflicting loyalties.","start":741.637,"stop":749.723,"duration":8.09},{"text":"The United States Code is for all instances in which government officials are forbidden to hold interest in private enterprises with which they may have to deal, the provision outlying interlocking directorates is a familiar one and the Board of Governors against Agnew this Court had before it a provision forbidding a partner or employee of an investment banking house from serving as an officer or director of a federal reserve bank.","start":749.723,"stop":782.974,"duration":33.25},{"text":"This is in other words a rather familiar technique and here in effect what Congress has done is the same thing.","start":782.974,"stop":793.765,"duration":10.79},{"text":"It is said that a man shall not or while he's a member of the Communist Party and therefore presumably subject to loyalty to it and

public faithfully and wholeheartedly.","start":793.765,"stop":820.694,"duration":26.93}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"(Inaudible) suppose the Communists held hearings and made a

parallel in the evidence that was available, then I would think that there would be one and only one important difference and that is that this Court has repeatedly recognized that the Communist Party

presents.","start":855.078,"stop":890.344,"duration":35.27},{"text":"Whether that would be a decisive difference I don't mean to say but I think it's a difference in our favor in this case.","start":890.344,"stop":898.322,"duration":7.98},{"text":"I would also doubt, Mr. Chief Justice, so I confess I don't know the evidence whether the record of history would be as persuasive on

activities through labor unions.","start":898.322,"stop":923.901,"duration":25.58},{"text":"And I would think therefore that a law forbidding members of the Klan from being officers of labor unions
