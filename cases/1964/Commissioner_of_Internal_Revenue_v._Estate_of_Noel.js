reasons for taxing it but not under the Third Circuit rationale.","start":677.237,"stop":685.83,"duration":8.59},{"text":"Now, the second reason or the third reason for -- in our view reversing the

treatises perhaps that's true, but I think treatise writers are exact to take issue with unsound decisions as anybody and I think in these same treatises if there are well established decisions with which they are in disagreement, you will find that they do not hesitate to express it.","start":723.741,"stop":749.252,"duration":25.51},{"text":"And I will think that the fact that this is reported is entitled to some weight, not in any sense conclusive but it adds to the picture which we see here.","start":749.252,"stop":759.126,"duration":9.87},{"text":"And the same thing maybe said for the Ackerman decision being known to Congress over the years.","start":759.126,"stop":766.545,"duration":7.42},{"text":"Again respondent here states, well there's no showing that this was ever called to Congress' attention, which we say granted and if this isn't the strongest case for congressional reenactment, but at the same time if there was discontent with the decision I think one could expect that over the course of 30 years, it would have been called to the attention of Congress and fitted into the picture as a whole.","start":766.545,"stop":785.946,"duration":19.4},{"text":"I think it is fair to say that Congress -- the inaction of Congress supports the view which we're now espousing.","start":785.946,"stop":794.459,"duration":8.51},{"text":"And the last reason which we would advance for the error in the decision of Third Circuit comes about from the interrelationship between the income tax and the estate tax.","start":794.459,"stop":807.57,"duration":13.11},{"text":"There is in Section 101 of the income tax which is printed at page 17 of our brief, just facing the 2042, a provision which excludes from income amounts paid under a life insurance contract.","start":807.57,"stop":825.777,"duration":18.21},{"text":"And the regulations under that section have always felt that, that language was strong enough to support exclusion of death benefits under accident insurance policy.","start":825.777,"stop":836.046,"duration":10.27},{"text":"It's the phrase under a life insurance contract, is I would think a narrower phrase in the statute to be construed than that phrase policies on the life of the decedent which we have in Section 2042 in front us now.","start":836.046,"stop":849.915,"duration":13.87},{"text":"And the reason -- the point to be made here is that if the Third Circuit rationale is accepted then the regulations under 101 are wrong and payments under an accident, so called accident insurance, accident life insurance policy should not be excluded from income under 101 and the price of obtaining the exposition from the estate would be to have it included in the income, which in virtually every case would be a much more expensive proposition tax wise.","start":849.915,"stop":880.865,"duration":30.95},{"text":"We don't urge that and I don't suppose if we lost this case we would even urge it, but it does seem to us to show that Congress had a very clear concept in mind of what life insurance was and that all the pieces in the puzzle fit together until this case came along and it does knock it considerably out of kilter and that the uncertainty should be removed and that the pattern of taxation of insurance on flight accidents should follow the pattern of all other life insurance.","start":880.865,"stop":920.172,"duration":39.31},{"text":"Now upon brief here the tax payer makes some point about the incidence of ownership and let me say that this is in our view a more troubling and a closer question under the -- on the facts of this case.","start":920.172,"stop":937.511,"duration":17.34},{"text":"That point however, was dealt with unanimously by -- neither the Court below disagreed on this.","start":937.511,"stop":944.14,"duration":6.63},{"text":"It seemed to us that Judge Brown was aware of all the arguments, treated them very carefully and was so satisfying to the Third Circuit that they passed over in a sentence with a statement that decedent here clearly did have the incidence of ownership.","start":944.14,"stop":959.328,"duration":15.19},{"text":"If I just outline the objections and our answers to them I might suggest one of the most important is a suggestion that somehow with the policies in the wife's hands and the insured on the airplane, there wasn't any practical way to exercise the power to change the beneficiary and I would just point out that on that Section 2042 very clearly speaks of power alone or in conjunction with any other person.","start":959.328,"stop":992.734,"duration":33.41},{"text":"And since the most that could be set for facts is that it puts it in the joint control of the decedent and his wife, that there would be no reason for allowing a person by their own act to just argue the impossibility of exercise when Congress has gone so far in advance to cover the possibility of being exercisable with some other person.","start":992.734,"stop":1017.06,"duration":24.33},{"text":"And another very practical possibility and one that has to be contemplated is that man who buys the flight insurance contract at the counter is not in a very effective position to change the beneficiary, he goes from the counter, he gets on the airplane and he's not going to be allowed to use the pilot's radio.","start":1017.06,"stop":1034.4,"duration":17.34},{"text":"There's not, as a practical matter, a great chance of exercising at that
