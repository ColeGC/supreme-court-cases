an order of the Federal Power Commission made under the Natural Gas Act.","start":72.938,"stop":86.622,"duration":13.68},{"text":"The case is one of great importance because if that decision stands, it opens what we conceive to be a very serious gap in the power of the Commission to regulate prices at which produces sell gas to pipelines under the Phillips Petroleum case.","start":86.622,"stop":106.504,"duration":19.88},{"text":"The essential facts are these, Texas Eastern is an interstate pipeline company with a system running from South Texas up to Northeast through Philadelphia and on to the New York area.","start":106.504,"stop":121.035,"duration":14.53},{"text":"The other respondents in this case are oil and gas producers who held leases in the Rayne Field in Louisiana.","start":121.035,"stop":130.787,"duration":9.75},{"text":"Early in 1957, the respondent producers, agreed to deliver gas in the Rayne Field, Texas Eastern at the initial price of $23.59 per thousand cubic feet over a period of what would probably be about 20 years.","start":130.787,"stop":148.403,"duration":17.62},{"text":"Texas Eastern then applied for certificates to construct the necessary facility.","start":148.403,"stop":154.321,"duration":5.92},{"text":"Under the Phillips Petroleum case, the Federal Power Commission clearly had jurisdiction not only over the construction of the facilities, but also over the agreement to sell the gas in the price at which it was sold.","start":154.321,"stop":169.439,"duration":15.12},{"text":"At this point, the Third Circuit rendered a decision in the Catco case which later came before this Court which made it apparent that the Commission could not approve the sale by these respondent producers to this pipeline company because this sale was at a price a cent-and-a-half higher than the sale which had been sale price that have been disapproved by the Third Circuit in Catco.","start":169.439,"stop":197.853,"duration":28.41},{"text":"The respondents then cancelled their agreement to sell the gas and recast the deal in the form that it is now before the Court.","start":197.853,"stop":209.228,"duration":11.38},{"text":"As in the form that it is now before the Court, the respondent producers conveyed to a newly created subsidiary of Texas Eastern.","start":209.228,"stop":219.859,"duration":10.63},{"text":"Their leasehold rights to gas in the Rayne Field down to a specified depth together with wells and related equipment.","start":219.859,"stop":230.37,"duration":10.51},{"text":"Reserving, it's important to emphasize is the so-called production payment all the condensates that could be extracted from the gas as it came from the ground.","start":230.37,"stop":242.378,"duration":12.01},{"text":"This new subsidiary then assigned its rights under the leases to Texas Eastern.","start":242.378,"stop":250.601,"duration":8.22},{"text":"Texas Eastern retained the respondent Continental which had been operating the field for the benefit of all the producers, under a management agreement to continue to operate the field, extracting the gas from the ground and ultimately delivering it to Texas Eastern.","start":250.601,"stop":270.61,"duration":20.01},{"text":"The consideration for the lease was $134 million about 9% payable in cash and the rest are paid in notes of the subsidiary which fell due periodically through the expected life of the gas field.","start":270.61,"stop":289.166,"duration":18.56},{"text":"Texas Eastern assumed no contractual liability and the subsidiary had no other assets beyond the lease that it assigned.","start":289.166,"stop":300.791,"duration":11.63},{"text":"Texas Eastern then went back to the Federal Power Commission for certification of the construction of the necessary facilities.","start":300.791,"stop":308.564,"duration":7.77},{"text":"At that stage, it was June 1959, the Commission assumed that it had no jurisdiction over this lease transaction and issued the necessary certificates.","start":308.564,"stop":320.473,"duration":11.91},{"text":"The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on review set aside the Commission's order upon the ground that the Commission might either go into the price at which the gas was transferred or the cost of the gas to Texas Eastern, or it might state clearly then entirely but that it had heard and indicating in the course of its opinion that the price or cost was in the public interest without sufficient evidence in the record to support that.","start":320.473,"stop":352.567,"duration":32.09},{"text":"And I should say that in the course of its opinion, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit also assume that the Commission had no jurisdiction over these transactions as such.","start":352.567,"stop":366.429,"duration":13.86},{"text":"Upon remand, the Commission reopened the entire matter.","start":366.429,"stop":371.305,"duration":4.88},{"text":"It then decided contrary to its early assumption and contrary to the assumption of the Circuit Court that the lease sale transaction was itself within the Commission's jurisdiction as a sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale and ultimate public consumption.","start":371.305,"stop":393.234,"duration":21.93},{"text":"On review, the Fifth Circuit set aside the Commission's order holding that since the transaction involved a lease of mineral rights, it constituted production and gathering and was not a sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale.","start":393.234,"stop":413.527,"duration":20.29},{"text":"We then brought the case here adjoined by one of the distributing companies in Philadelphia area represented by Mr. Coleman and the question very simply is whether the Commission was right in holding that it had jurisdiction or whether the Fifth Circuit was right in holding that it had not.","start":413.527,"stop":432.8,"duration":19.27},{"text":"The case turns on Section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act which is printed on pages 2 and 3 of our brief.","start":432.8,"stop":444.211,"duration":11.41},{"text":"It gives the Commission jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and more importantly over the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption.","start":444.211,"stop":460.039,"duration":15.83},{"text":"But it excludes the production and gathering or production or gathering of natural gas.","start":460.039,"stop":467.567,"duration":7.53},{"text":"The term sale in interstate commerce of natural gas and production for gathering are used in contradistinction as this Court held in the interstate case in the Phillips Petroleum case.","start":467.567,"stop":482.218,"duration":14.65},{"text":"If a transaction involves a sale of natural gas in interstate commerce, then that part of the transaction at least is not production of the gathering and therefore not excluded from the Commission's jurisdiction.","start":482.218,"stop":496.37,"duration":14.15},{"text":"Consequently, we can concentrate here on the question whether these transactions, this lease sale transaction that I described constitutes a sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale.","start":496.37,"stop":514.75,"duration":18.38},{"text":"And the starting point of course in inquiring into that question is the settled premise to their producer's agreement to sell and deliver natural gas to an interstate pipeline company is subject to regulation by the Federal Power Commission, and that was the Phillips Petroleum case in 347 U.S. and of course it's been predicated in numerous subsequent decisions.","start":514.75,"stop":539.582,"duration":24.83},{"text":"There's not the slightest doubt to put the points specifically that the respondent producers earlier agreement in this case to sell the gas in the Rayne Field to Texas Eastern over a 20-year period and its implicit dedication of the gas to the public, to the performance of that contract, I should say, was a sale requiring certification by the Commission and subject to its disapproval.","start":539.582,"stop":569.611,"duration":30.03},{"text":"Our argument is that the recasting of the transaction made it no less a sale in interstate commerce of natural gas and we proceed in three steps.","start":569.611,"stop":582.771,"duration":13.16},{"text":"First, we say that the Commission had ample basis for concluding that revised transaction viewed from the standpoint of the policy of the Natural Gas Act involved what was both in fact and in economic function a sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale to the public.","start":582.771,"stop":604.903,"duration":22.13},{"text":"Texas Eastern thereby acquired gas as a pipeline for interstate transportation and resale.","start":604.903,"stop":612.144,"duration":7.24},{"text":"It thereby fixed the cost of the gas that it was going to resell and it didn't really take on to any significant degree of the functions of a producer.","start":612.144,"stop":623.87,"duration":11.73},{"text":"Second, we submit that whether a transaction involves a jurisdictional sale as they say, a sale in interstate commerce depends not upon concepts and definitions that may be important in the law of sales and conveyancing, but upon as I put it the fact and economic function of the transaction viewed from the policy of the act that we're charged with applying, viewed here from the standpoint of public regulation of this industry.","start":623.87,"stop":659.557,"duration":35.69},{"text":"And then third, we distinguish the Panhandle case which was so much relied upon by the court below.","start":659.557,"stop":669.907,"duration":10.35},{"text":"Very little argument it seems to me is necessary to show that the Commission had ample basis for concluding that from a regulatory standpoint, the transaction and the question had the same functions and would have the same kind of effect upon rates as an ordinary agreement to sell such as was involved in the Phillips Petroleum case.","start":669.907,"stop":692.99,"duration":23.08},{"text":"Conversely, it seems to us that when you look at this from the standpoint of its substance of its economic function or the fact that the distinctions between this and an ordinary lease for exploration, development, and production become very, very clear.","start":692.99,"stop":714.993,"duration":22},{"text":"Let me emphasize just a few points; first, what Texas Eastern obtained here was natural gas for its interstate pipeline system.","start":714.993,"stop":727.003,"duration":12.01},{"text":"The Rayne Field was proven largely developed and so the estimates of the amount of gas there varied, it's clear that that was gas in a very large quantity.","start":727.003,"stop":739.718,"duration":12.71},{"text":"Texas Eastern as a pipeline wanted that gas.","start":739.718,"stop":743.426,"duration":3.71},{"text":"It wasn't interested in exploration or development or production.","start":743.426,"stop":749.47,"duration":6.04},{"text":"The conclusive proof I think is that these transactions did replace a conventional agreement to sell the gas lasting over a period of roughly 20 years.","start":749.47,"stop":760.351,"duration":10.88},{"text":"No one has ever suggested so far as I am aware that there was any substantial reason for recasting the transaction except the effort to get it out from under the Commission's jurisdiction.","start":760.351,"stop":773.163,"duration":12.81},{"text":"Indeed, in withdrawing the application, the old applications for proof, the respondent Continental gave as the reason in seeking leave to withdraw them that all the producers had entered into negotiation with Texas Eastern to sell their gas in place.","start":773.163,"stop":793.84,"duration":20.68},{"text":"They described it as a sale of gas and they said that by assigning the leasehold rights, such in place sale of natural gas had been made.","start":793.84,"stop":806.076,"duration":12.24},{"text":"Second, I would emphasize that Texas Eastern took on very few of the typical functions of a producer or gatherer.","start":806.076,"stop":815.92,"duration":9.84},{"text":"It acquired only natural gas.","start":815.92,"stop":819.067,"duration":3.15},{"text":"All the oil or other mineral rights were withheld.","start":819.067,"stop":823.774,"duration":4.71},{"text":"The net proceeds from all the liquefiable hydrocarbons, so what could be extracted from the gas were reserved as a production payment to the producers say for a little bit at the end of the lease.","start":823.774,"stop":838.271,"duration":14.5},{"text":"The respondent producers even reserved the rights to the gas deep down below a specified level where further exploration might be conducted.","start":838.271,"stop":849.289,"duration":11.02},{"text":"And finally, I would point out that to a large but not 100% extent, Texas Eastern even left with the producers the responsibility for bringing the gas to the surface.","start":849.289,"stop":865.472,"duration":16.18},{"text":"That responsibility of the field had been managed by Continental.","start":865.472,"stop":869.899,"duration":4.43},{"text":"A Texas Eastern subsidiary entered into a management contract with Continental on giving to it most of the work of bringing this gas to the surface, also it reserved certain ultimate rights and responsibilities and just as the producers had paid before the cost of Continental is doing this.","start":869.899,"stop":891.62,"duration":21.72},{"text":"So under the agreements, the cost came out of the production payment assuming that there was any production payment because they were condensates and thus was subtracted from what all the producers would get under the production payment.","start":891.62,"stop":908.984,"duration":17.36},{"text":"And so in all probability would be born in the same fashion as originally.","start":908.984,"stop":914.829,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Third, I would emphasize that this transaction was the final step by which gas would pass from true producers into the pipeline where interstate transportation at sale.","start":914.829,"stop":928.897,"duration":14.07},{"text":"We're not dealing here with a transfer of leasehold rights among producers, those who are interested in exploration, development or simply in bringing the gas up under circumstances where another transfer would be necessary to put the gas into the interstate pipeline.","start":928.897,"stop":949.639,"duration":20.74},{"text":"This was the transaction, the final commercial step that committed the gas to the pipeline system for interstate commerce.","start":949.639,"stop":961.683,"duration":12.04},{"text":"And fourth, I would emphasize that this is the transaction just like the kind of agreement involved in the Phillips case that fixes the cost of the gas to the pipeline and it will therefore be a critical element in fixing Texas Eastern's rates that it may charge to the distribution companies and so ultimately to the public.","start":961.683,"stop":984.651,"duration":22.97},{"text":"There are exactly the same reasons here for regulating this transaction that there were for holding that the Commission had jurisdiction in the Phillips Petroleum case.","start":984.651,"stop":997.72,"duration":13.07},{"text":"And I could confess that I can think of no reasons that would lead to not regulating this transaction.","start":997.72,"stop":1004.95,"duration":7.23},{"text":"It might not also have been applied in Phillips Petroleum case.","start":1004.95,"stop":1011.451,"duration":6.5}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
