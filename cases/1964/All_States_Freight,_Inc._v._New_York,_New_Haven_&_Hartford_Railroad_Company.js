1958.","start":93.647,"stop":103.44,"duration":9.79},{"text":"The New York Central offered that service and its initial phase only to those two cities and the Plan III trailer-on-flatcar service was

shipment.","start":140.235,"stop":156.401,"duration":16.17},{"text":"The tariff also provided that the trailers had to be supplied by the shipper and that the shipper likewise had to supply his own

the New Haven lost 400 car loads of traffic to these two destinations which it could identify.","start":195.043,"stop":211.756,"duration":16.71},{"text":"I should also point out that the New Haven had also published these Plan III charges for the new trailer-on-flatcar service but it had some disabilities.","start":211.756,"stop":226.44,"duration":14.68},{"text":"It had two gateways to the west.","start":226.44,"stop":229.327,"duration":2.89},{"text":"One at Maybrook, New York and the other one in New York City itself, I think the New Haven called the Harlem River where it made

by all of its connections.","start":252.858,"stop":280.624,"duration":27.77},{"text":"It had under progress, however, a program for eliminating its low occurrences and accordingly it published these

one long one.","start":331.799,"stop":341.126,"duration":9.33},{"text":"The original Plan III contemplated that there would be two trailers to each flatcar and the New Haven didn't have long flatcars.","start":341.126,"stop":350.761,"duration":9.64},{"text":"I mentioned these matters because I think it's important due to the fact that the New Haven, even after it had eliminated its difficulties that I have spoken of and was in a position to secure the traffic under Plan III continued nonetheless to press for approval of these rates.","start":350.761,"stop":372.117,"duration":21.36},{"text":"This was recognized by the Commission in its decision.","start":372.117,"stop":375.932,"duration":3.81},{"text":"When the rates were
