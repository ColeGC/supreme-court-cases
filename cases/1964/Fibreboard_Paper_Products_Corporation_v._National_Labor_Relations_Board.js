follows:","start":20.961,"stop":31.285,"duration":10.32},{"text":"One, was petitioner required by the National Labor Relations Act to bargain with a union representing some of its employees about whether to let to an independent contractor for legitimate business reasons, the performance of certain operations in which those employees had been engaged.","start":31.285,"stop":60.861,"duration":29.58},{"text":"Two, was the Board in a case involving only a refusal to bargain empowered to order the resumption of operations which had been

Fibreboard Paper Products Corporation, and to avoid myself getting mixed up between petitioner and respondent, I will, if it please the Court, refer to the petitioner as Fibreboard.","start":88.495,"stop":105.866,"duration":17.37},{"text":"Fibreboard owns or did own in 1959 a number of manufacturing plants on the Pacific Coast and in some offshore states.","start":105.866,"stop":119.591,"duration":13.72},{"text":"One of those plants was located at Emeryville, California.","start":119.591,"stop":125.915,"duration":6.32},{"text":"There were 13 unions in the plant.","start":125.915,"stop":131.339,"duration":5.42},{"text":"Five of them represented one or another unit of maintenance workers.","start":131.339,"stop":139.414,"duration":8.07},{"text":"The largest unit of maintenance workers was represented by a local of the steel workers, which is the union involved in this case.","start":139.414,"stop":157.572,"duration":18.16},{"text":"For some years, Fibreboard had been concerned about the high cost of its maintenance work, the work of maintaining that plant.","start":157.572,"stop":172.221,"duration":14.65},{"text":"In 1957 and again in 1958, it had sought to persuade the union to modify its wage and other contract demands, so as to permit Fibreboard to operate and carry on these maintenance operations at the cost which would not be too high.","start":172.221,"stop":201.453,"duration":29.23},{"text":"Those efforts had been unsuccessful.","start":201.453,"stop":205.639,"duration":4.19},{"text":"Thereafter, it commenced a study of the possibility of affecting savings and costs by letting this work to an independent contractor specializing in plant maintenance.","start":205.639,"stop":226.243,"duration":20.6},{"text":"The collective bargaining contract which was in effect in 1959 and by the way, Fibreboard had had collective bargaining contractual relationships with its union for 22 years, the current contract was to -- expired or at least the termination date was on July 31st, 1959.","start":226.243,"stop":255.676,"duration":29.43},{"text":"The required 60 days before that date, the union gave notice of desire to modify that contract and shortly thereafter served upon Fibreboard proposals involving changes in every provision of the contract which affected costs, and each of those changes would have increased the costs.","start":255.676,"stop":287.746,"duration":32.07},{"text":"Fibreboard thereafter brought its study up to date of the question of letting this work to an independent contractor and decided to do so.","start":287.746,"stop":302.091,"duration":14.35},{"text":"It reached that decision on July 27th, 1959.","start":302.091,"stop":310.317,"duration":8.23},{"text":"On that date, it had not yet decided who the contractor would be, but it had satisfied itself by getting figures from several and considering the problem with several, that savings and cost could be affected by that means.","start":310.317,"stop":330.482,"duration":20.17},{"text":"Immediately and I mean within the hour, after that decision was made, the Fibreboard director of industrial relations called the local and international business agents of the union and arranged a meeting with them or a meeting with them later that day.","start":330.482,"stop":355.627,"duration":25.14},{"text":"At that meeting he handed them a letter stating that Fibreboard had reached its decision that in view of the decision which had been reached, Fibreboard considered that negotiation of a renewed contract would be pointless but that nevertheless Fibreboard would be glad to discuss any questions the union might have.","start":355.627,"stop":388.17,"duration":32.54},{"text":"During the course of the meeting, the director, Mr. Tuman (ph), told the business agents that he had in mind a plan for severance pay which he outlined, they had no comments upon that or any suggestions to make with respect to that question.","start":388.17,"stop":415.609,"duration":27.44},{"text":"The conversation on that occasion was pretty much limited to assertions by the business agents that Fibreboard couldn't do it and by Tuman that Fibreboard could.","start":415.609,"stop":430.672,"duration":15.06},{"text":"The business agents without specifying what provision of the National Labor Relations Act they have referenced too, I guess they didn't know their claim that if Fibreboard did this it would be violating the National Labor Relations Act.","start":430.672,"stop":449.137,"duration":18.46},{"text":"At the conclusion of the meeting, Tuman was asked if he would meet with the union's negotiating committee and he said that he would.","start":449.137,"stop":461.86,"duration":12.72},{"text":"That meeting was held on July 30.","start":461.86,"stop":467.628,"duration":5.77},{"text":"In the meantime on July 29th, the union wrote Fibreboard a letter taking the position that its contract have been automatically renewed subject only to an obligation upon the part of Fibreboard to bargain about all of these contract changes.","start":467.628,"stop":492.288,"duration":24.66},{"text":"At the meeting of July 30th with the negotiating committee, Tuman took the position that that wasn't so.","start":492.288,"stop":504.55,"duration":12.26},{"text":"He of course repeated that Fibreboard had reached this position.","start":504.55,"stop":513.033,"duration":8.48},{"text":"He explained the reasons for it, namely, the high cost of the present operation and again repeated that he would be glad to discuss any questions that the union might have.","start":513.033,"stop":527.083,"duration":14.05},{"text":"In the course of the conversation, he again outlined the plan for severance pay, no objections were raised to it.","start":527.083,"stop":538.574,"duration":11.49},{"text":"Now, he did say that he was not there for the purpose of negotiating a renewed contract but that because he thought that would be pointless.","start":538.574,"stop":550.588,"duration":12.01},{"text":"He did not, however, cutoff discussion regarding the contract.","start":550.588,"stop":556.287,"duration":5.7},{"text":"On the contrary, the union certainly didn't understand that.","start":556.287,"stop":562.231,"duration":5.94},{"text":"It proposed for example that there -- and contained in the renewed contract a provision to the effect that a Fibreboard should contract out work.","start":562.231,"stop":575.449,"duration":13.22},{"text":"The contractor should be required to employ members of the union.","start":575.449,"stop":580.887,"duration":5.44},{"text":"Tuman said that that wouldn't be acceptable because he wouldn't want to tie a contractor's hands.","start":580.887,"stop":587.927,"duration":7.04},{"text":"If he were a lawyer, he probably would've added that would be illegal.","start":587.927,"stop":593.453,"duration":5.53},{"text":"The union also proposed that the question whether the contract should be let -- be submitted to arbitration.","start":593.453,"stop":606.42,"duration":12.97},{"text":"Tuman replied that the company would not want to place a business decision such as that in the hands of an arbitrator.","start":606.42,"stop":617.789,"duration":11.37},{"text":"There were some objection -- two occasions by members of the union to the shortness of the notice.","start":617.789,"stop":628.196,"duration":10.41},{"text":"This contract with the independent contractor was to take effect as of August 1st.","start":628.196,"stop":636.209,"duration":8.01},{"text":"In reply to that, Tuman said that the -- if the union wished to further time to consider the problem, they would entertain a proposal that the contracting be deferred in order to give the union that time.","start":636.209,"stop":656.206,"duration":20},{"text":"Advantage was not taken of that

changes in demanding requirements, lower wage cost, that would have been given very serious consideration, but the union never saw fit to make such a proposal.","start":678.193,"stop":700.323,"duration":22.13},{"text":"Well, at midnight, July 31st Fibreboard had a picket line and thereafter the union filed the unfair labor practice charges which brought about the present case.","start":700.323,"stop":725.64,"duration":25.32},{"text":"Fibreboard was charged with a multitude of sins.","start":725.64,"stop":730.478,"duration":4.84},{"text":"One was discrimination against the union alleged that it was -- purpose was discriminatory, other charges embraced refusal to bargain.","start":730.478,"stop":744.355,"duration":13.88},{"text":"The hearing was had before the Trial Examiner in which attention was focused mostly upon the question whether there had been a discriminatory motive.","start":744.355,"stop":759.153,"duration":14.8},{"text":"There was also attention given to the question whether Fibreboard had refused to bargain about severance pay.","start":759.153,"stop":771.178,"duration":12.02},{"text":"The Trial Examiner rendered a report in which he found against the union and general counsel on all issues and recommended that the complaint be dismissed.","start":771.178,"stop":787.208,"duration":16.03},{"text":"The case then went up in the normal course to the Board itself.","start":787.208,"stop":795.43,"duration":8.22},{"text":"The Board adopted the Trial Examiner's findings and dismissed the case.","start":795.43,"stop":805.826,"duration":10.4},{"text":"In the course of its opinion however, it noted that general counsel in his exceptions to the Trial Examiners had report had complained that the Trial Examiner did not pass upon an issue claimed to be of primary importance in the case.","start":805.826,"stop":829.1,"duration":23.27},{"text":"Namely, the question whether Fibreboard was under a duty to bargain about the decision to let the contract, in other words, about whether or not it should let the contract to this independent contracting.","start":829.1,"stop":855.042,"duration":25.94},{"text":"At that time, there were a long line of Board decisions which had received a congressional approval as I will demonstrate a little bit later.","start":855.042,"stop":871.03,"duration":15.99},{"text":"And there were a number of court decisions all based upon the hypothesis that there was no duty to bargain about whether you let a contract, whether you discontinue a business, whether you sell it.","start":871.03,"stop":895.448,"duration":24.42},{"text":"Those cases regarded the act as requiring and not let you bargain about the operations which are going to carry on, but only about the wages, hours and terms and conditions upon which manner to be employed in those operations upon which you decide.","start":895.448,"stop":923.781,"duration":28.33},{"text":"And accordingly they had held that there was no duty to bargain over a question such as this.","start":923.781,"stop":932.412,"duration":8.63},{"text":"However, shortly after that decision was rendered the membership of the Board changed.","start":932.412,"stop":944.887,"duration":12.47},{"text":"The union and general counsel both moved for reconsideration and the Board after sitting on those motions for a year and a half vacated its -- no, that's not true -- modified its prior decision to the extent of holding that there was a duty to bargain about whether or not you can let work to an independent contractor.","start":944.887,"stop":984.745,"duration":39.86},{"text":"Now, there were several peculiarities about this.","start":984.745,"stop":988.935,"duration":4.19},{"text":"In its first decision, the Board had said that you were under no such duty and never considered or passed upon the question whether Fibreboard had in fact bargained.","start":988.935,"stop":1003.991,"duration":15.06},{"text":"In the second decision, the Board or rather the panel of the Board likely assumed that the Board in its first decision had held that Fibreboard did not in fact bargained and proceeded to decide the case on that basis.","start":1003.991,"stop":1025.667,"duration":21.68},{"text":"A few months before the second decision, there had come before the Board, the Town & Country Manufacturing Company case.","start":1025.667,"stop":1039.166,"duration":13.5},{"text":"That was a case in which the employer had contracted out work for the purpose of frustrating unionization, of avoiding his bargaining obligation and he was guilty of an unfair labor practice for this reason.","start":1039.166,"stop":1058.03,"duration":18.86},{"text":"The Board went out of its way however to say that even if this had not been true, it considered that there was a duty to bargain that its first Fibreboard decision was wrong, and that that the employer would have been guilty of a refusal to bargain even though there have been no improper motivation.","start":1058.03,"stop":1086.679,"duration":28.65},{"text":"It based that decision upon the ground that after all, the decision to contract out work has impact and effect upon the employment in the plant.","start":1086.679,"stop":1105.12,"duration":18.44},{"text":"The reason for that long delay of year and a half in deciding Fibreboard number two was that one of the members of the Board had been the regional director who issued the complaint and was therefore disqualified.","start":1105.12,"stop":1138.933,"duration":33.81},{"text":"The Board therefore, those who were qualified to participate were evenly divided, two to two.","start":1138.933,"stop":1148.55,"duration":9.62},{"text":"Now, as this Court knows from its own practice normally, what has done in that situation is to deny release by an equally divided court.","start":1148.55,"stop":1163.559,"duration":15.01},{"text":"In that case, it should've been to deny relief by an equally divided Board but the Board didn't do that.","start":1163.559,"stop":1173.777,"duration":10.22},{"text":"The reason is explained by the Solicitor General in his answer to the petition for certiorari as follows.","start":1173.777,"stop":1183.373,"duration":9.6},{"text":"Both the general counsel and the union sought reconsideration.","start":1183.373,"stop":1188.683,"duration":5.31},{"text":"Due to changes in the membership of the Board and the disqualification of one member to participate in the case, the agency was equally divided even though a majority of the Board as then constituted was of the view that an employer has an obligation to bargain about a decision to contract out an operation.","start":1188.683,"stop":1220.097,"duration":31.41},{"text":"In these circumstances, the agency did not abuse its discretion in postponing its decision on the motions of reconsideration and until as a result of another decision, the majority view could be applied in the case.","start":1220.097,"stop":1239.358,"duration":19.26},{"text":"In other words, until the view of a member who was disqualified could be applied in the case.","start":1239.358,"stop":1247.32,"duration":7.96}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Had to disqualify it under the position

time in the history of the Act in a case involving only a refusal to bargain, it ordered reinstatement with back pay.","start":1260.657,"stop":1284.047,"duration":23.39},{"text":"It ordered that Fibreboard resume performance of the maintenance operations which had been discontinued as too costly and that the individuals who had been employed therein be reinstated with back pay to the date of the order.","start":1284.047,"stop":1305.778,"duration":21.73},{"text":"It didn't order back pay all the way back because they recognized that after all Fibreboard had received a pretty bad treatment problem.","start":1305.778,"stop":1318.582,"duration":12.8},{"text":"Now, as I have said, there was a long line of Board decisions to the contrary and what the Board did in the Town & Country case and in the present case was simply to change the law.","start":1318.582,"stop":1342.26,"duration":23.68},{"text":"The earliest decision and dealing with this question of contracting was rendered in 1941.","start":1342.26,"stop":1367.369,"duration":25.11},{"text":"It was the case of Brown McLaren Manufacturing Company.","start":1367.369,"stop":1375.041,"duration":7.67},{"text":"In that case, the company had a contract with Sears, Roebuck for the performance of certain manufacturing operations.","start":1375.041,"stop":1386.904,"duration":11.86},{"text":"It was losing money on that contact, it conceived that the reason that it was losing money was that its wage cost were too high.","start":1386.904,"stop":1395.577,"duration":8.67},{"text":"It sought wage relief from the union and manning relief, it was unable to obtain it, and then contracted out to another contractor, the Sears, Roebuck work.","start":1395.577,"stop":1412.763,"duration":17.19},{"text":"Now, in connection with that aspect of the case, the Board said that if there was any duty to bargain about reduced wages as an alternative to contracting out, that duty had been satisfied.","start":1412.763,"stop":1426.727,"duration":13.96},{"text":"But that wasn't the end of the matter.","start":1426.727,"stop":1430.315,"duration":3.59},{"text":"The employer then proceeded to contract out other work in the plant and moved work to another plant which it had ultimate -- which it ultimately acquired.","start":1430.315,"stop":1445.985,"duration":15.67},{"text":"The union asked that the employer bargain about this matter of letting work to other contractors or moving it out of the plant, the employer denied doing it.","start":1445.985,"stop":1462.87,"duration":16.88},{"text":"Some more time went by, the same request was made, the employer still denied doing it.","start":1462.87,"stop":1469.405,"duration":6.54},{"text":"The third time, it still denied doing it but when confronted with some facts by the union, admitted it, and refused to discuss the matter.","start":1469.405,"stop":1481.424,"duration":12.02},{"text":"Thereafter on several occasions, the request was made that it bargained about removal of work in the future from the plant, the union offered to talk about a wage decrease, the employer refused to negotiate, refused to discuss the matter.","start":1481.424,"stop":1505.647,"duration":24.22},{"text":"The Board held that in these circumstances, the employer was not guilty of a refusal to bargain.","start":1505.647,"stop":1515.536,"duration":9.89},{"text":"However, the Board do a distinction which is significant in later cases that said that although it was not guilty of a refusal to bargain about letting the contract, it should have bargained with the union upon the union's request that employees be transferred to the new plant.","start":1515.536,"stop":1538.733,"duration":23.2},{"text":"In other words, should have bargained about their tenure of employment.","start":1538.733,"stop":1544.687,"duration":5.95},{"text":"Now, counsel say that it is doubtful that that case really held that there was no duty to bargain.","start":1544.687,"stop":1555.76,"duration":11.07},{"text":"Now, if it was equivocal and that maybe, I don't know, there certainly was nothing equivocal about the decisions which

farther.","start":3847.83,"stop":3851.947,"duration":4.12},{"text":"It argues that what I have called contracting out is a statutory subjection of collective bargaining.","start":3851.947,"stop":3859.862,"duration":7.91},{"text":"And we used the term contracting out to cover not only bringing the employees of a labor contractor into the plant, to take men's jobs but also shipping work that has normally been done in the bargaining unit out of the plant where it will be done by someone else and his employees.","start":3859.862,"stop":3880.547,"duration":20.68},{"text":"I should point out that there is this difference where you're bringing men into the plant, this weight of the whole thing is on

weight.","start":3892.155,"stop":3895.187,"duration":3.03},{"text":"And some of the shipping of work out of the plant may involve in addition to depriving men of the work may involve problems of
