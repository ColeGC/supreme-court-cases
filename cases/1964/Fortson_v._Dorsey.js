about the -- about the election county at large, we do not feel that there's any mathematical evaluation in the vote, because while a person who say residing in Fulton county has the right to vote for seven senators and he has seven people representing him en banc, his influence theoretically upon any single senator is seven times less than anyone in the rural or one of your lesser populated districts where everyone is represented by a single Senator.","start":450.833,"stop":480.074,"duration":29.24},{"text":"And to appeal that mathematically it balances out, of course the advantage of being represented by a single Senator is that you are part of a smaller constituency.","start":480.074,"stop":488.518,"duration":8.44},{"text":"And the advantage of being represented by seven Senators is or the disadvantage of being represented by seven Senators is that you are a part of a larger constituency, but this balances out mathematically.","start":488.518,"stop":498.099,"duration":9.58},{"text":"And of course, that's the whole question, so there's no question in this case about the 54 additions now being apportioned according to population.","start":498.099,"stop":505.9,"duration":7.8},{"text":"Now the second thing is, is actually we think from a mathematical point of view, it works even this practice of Georgia's election standard even less discriminatory, permit within permissible standards that will have then having 54 single member districts.","start":505.9,"stop":521.113,"duration":15.21},{"text":"For instance in Fulton, county to give you an example, we have seven senatorial districts, which we say are substantially equal, but of course you can't get them exactly equal, so contemplating the district.","start":521.113,"stop":531.595,"duration":10.48},{"text":"You have the district that has the most population that is a little under representative and the district that has the least population is a little bit over represented and of course you have the varying degrees in between, understand we can get all this as permissible.","start":531.595,"stop":544.242,"duration":12.65},{"text":"But if you elect them by districts in Fulton county, so that means the voters in some districts have a little smaller, but permissible edge over those and others.","start":544.242,"stop":552.281,"duration":8.04},{"text":"However when you elect them county at large then every voter in Fulton county has an exactly equal vote.","start":552.281,"stop":559.417,"duration":7.14},{"text":"So that led to discrimination although permissible is completely taken out.","start":559.417,"stop":568.713,"duration":9.3},{"text":"Now this case subdivides into two parts.","start":568.713,"stop":573.594,"duration":4.88},{"text":"The first part is the combination of single and multi member districts within the same house.","start":573.594,"stop":582.456,"duration":8.86},{"text":"And the other part is, is the election with any county electing them county-wide.","start":582.456,"stop":588.236,"duration":5.78},{"text":"Now as to the first part, the record is very clear that the practice of combining single and multi member districts in one house has been done throughout the United States for a long period of time.","start":588.236,"stop":602.771,"duration":14.53},{"text":"Also, as I mentioned earlier, this Court's decision in Reynolds versus Sims and in the Colorado Apportionment case has especially approved that practice.","start":602.771,"stop":616.312,"duration":13.54},{"text":"And even when the Court -- even when this Court in the Colorado case was explaining why possibly the Colorado referendum, which favored something other than population.","start":616.312,"stop":627.198,"duration":10.89},{"text":"The reason that failed was because that the people may not want to vote in a system whereby the more populous counties in Colorado would have to elect a large number of legislators.","start":627.198,"stop":636.767,"duration":9.57},{"text":"The Court was nevertheless careful to point out that we are not intimate that apportionment schemes which provide for the at large election of a number of legislators from a county or any political subdivision are constitutionally defective.","start":636.767,"stop":648.082,"duration":11.31},{"text":"Rather, they would merely point out that there are certain aspects for electing legislators at large from a county as a whole that might well make the adoption of such a scheme unresolved with many voters residing in multi member counties.","start":648.082,"stop":659.244,"duration":11.16},{"text":"Also, this Court in those cases has approved the practice of using political subdivision lines in drawing legislative districts.","start":659.244,"stop":667.496,"duration":8.25},{"text":"Also, this Court as recently as the 17th of last month based on the decision in Scranton versus Drew, the three-judge Court decision and you know, the State of Pennsylvania has somewhat of a similar apportion of this, although it's not as consistent as the Georgia plan.","start":667.496,"stop":685.395,"duration":17.9},{"text":"Now in the Pennsylvania case, Pennsylvania is saying, this is only the House of Representatives, the same that the senate only has single member districts, but in Pennsylvania, they have taken a county and they have divided with the most populous county within 30 districts and within that county, some districts had two members and some of them more.","start":685.395,"stop":702.654,"duration":17.26},{"text":"Now in Scranton versus Drew found that per se unconstitutional, but of course, you have constituency you have there in Georgia.","start":702.654,"stop":710.651,"duration":8},{"text":"Well in the mean time, after that stage was made the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Butcher versus Bloom also determined that the Pennsylvania legislature did not measure up the constitutional standards, because of population disparities.","start":710.651,"stop":726.51,"duration":15.86},{"text":"But in that Butcher versus Bloom, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found out the combination of single and multi member districts was not per se unconstitutional.","start":726.51,"stop":737.442,"duration":10.93},{"text":"And that -- and that you could well have it together if done properly on a rational basis without population disparities.","start":737.442,"stop":744.864,"duration":7.42},{"text":"Now, because of the willingness, the willingness of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to assume the chore of bringing the Pennsylvania legislature up to constitutional standards, this Court based here in Scranton versus Drew and gave the Pennsylvania Supreme Court the green light to rectify the situation in Pennsylvania.","start":744.864,"stop":766.996,"duration":22.13},{"text":"Now as to the election as the second difference about the election at large within the county, as the Court well knows that we signed our brief here, many municipalities in the United States elect their Councilmen or their Alderman at large and at the same time require these Councilmen and Aldermen come from various parts of the city.","start":766.996,"stop":786.432,"duration":19.44},{"text":"The city that having been divided into wards, a city that we cite particularly is the City of Atlanta and the City of Atlanta has enjoyed as this Court well knows a moderate and racial relationship also the city of course is very progressive.","start":786.432,"stop":804.228,"duration":17.8},{"text":"And one of the reasons why the city, we believe has done so well is because the Alderman of the city has had to run city-wide and they have had a city-wide approach to problems and if we think that if that works well in the City of Atlanta, it works well in other cities of the United States.","start":804.228,"stop":819.558,"duration":15.33},{"text":"If there are no debates in voting strength that we see no reason why it should not work the same way in electing the Fulton county delegation.","start":819.558,"stop":829.377,"duration":9.82},{"text":"Now these cases, this case here involves the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause.","start":829.377,"stop":835.645,"duration":6.27},{"text":"Now the Equal Protection Clause has been historically and traditionally interpreted to this Court as having a wide latitude for state action and of course, I won't go into detail of the cases, but of course this Court is familiar with Norvell versus Illinois, which is the case filed in Griffin versus Illinois.","start":835.645,"stop":853.877,"duration":18.23},{"text":"In Norvell, the plaintiff complained that he should be released, because he cannot have a case reheard, because the court reporter died and there was no transcript available.","start":853.877,"stop":865.959,"duration":12.08},{"text":"And so the -- this Court determined in an opinion by Justice Douglas I believe that they -- that the -- that the rough accommodation, accommodations made by the government did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment unless the lines drawn are hostile and invidious.","start":865.959,"stop":884.188,"duration":18.23},{"text":"That was a 1963 decision which very recently has shown to play the latitude that a State has under the Equal Protection Clause.","start":884.188,"stop":891.788,"duration":7.6},{"text":"The Court -- the Court is also familiar with the case in McGowan versus Maryland wherein it stated a statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reason that maybe conceived to justify.","start":891.788,"stop":904.382,"duration":12.59},{"text":"Now on this county at large election, we believe that because of the fact that there is at the counter effect that reflects a fairly solid unit of political thinking that it is a rational approach to require a representative elected county at large.","start":904.382,"stop":923.869,"duration":19.49},{"text":"Now in the brief, the appellees also comment upon this matter of submerging certain elements within the constituency.","start":923.869,"stop":935.625,"duration":11.76},{"text":"They say that in Georgia, a senatorial district the average is about 73,000 population.","start":935.625,"stop":941.299,"duration":5.67},{"text":"They say to require the at large election of these more populous Counties is -- submerges certain groups to certain interest within the more populous counties, that these groups are identifiable so they say and that they should have their own personal representative in the General Assembly.","start":941.299,"stop":959.778,"duration":18.48},{"text":"So this thing about submerging various interests of minor political parties and so forth, that submerge it can occur just as easily in single-member districts as it can in your plural-member districts.","start":959.778,"stop":971.477,"duration":11.7},{"text":"For instance, in California, California has a Senate composed of 40 members and the average population for a Senate member is 392,000, almost 393,000.","start":971.477,"stop":981.759,"duration":10.28},{"text":"Now obviously, as California -- I don't know what the situation is out there apportionment wise, but if California were to divide the State into 40 single-member senatorial districts and require one member to come from each, then no doubt, there would be no complaint.","start":981.759,"stop":996.24,"duration":14.48},{"text":"But obviously, within that 393,000 there have been many minor parties, many view points and so forth merged.","start":996.24,"stop":1004.603,"duration":8.36},{"text":"We do not believe that, that approach is significant, because we believe the two criterion which this Court has thus far required is first, that it should be a rational basis, because this cannot be some crazy – affair with no rationality.","start":1004.603,"stop":1019.9,"duration":15.3},{"text":"The lines cannot be drawn hostile and invidiously, such as they were drawn in the Gomillion case whereby the City of Tuskegee city limits were redone I think in a 28 sided figure to exclude the Negro population here and there.","start":1019.9,"stop":1034.511,"duration":14.61},{"text":"That it must be -- the first is it must be rational, we believe it

anytime.","start":1037.513,"stop":1055.738,"duration":18.23},{"text":"Now we believe here that what this case presents is nothing more than a political debate, which addresses itself to General
