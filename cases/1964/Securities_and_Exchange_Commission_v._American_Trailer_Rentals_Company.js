obligations, which this company had undertaken from the outset of its business paying 24% and 36% a monthly return on the investment without regard to the earnings, in view of the very substantial commissions that have been taken out of this money that was supposed to go into the purchase of trailers, it's not surprising that the company was in financial difficulties for its entire life, the

amounts including amounts, which Executive Sales had taken as a commission on the sale of new trailers.","start":841.683,"stop":857.112,"duration":15.43},{"text":"So, it amounted to an effect that at

sold.","start":857.112,"stop":873.06,"duration":15.95},{"text":"It had needless to add over the period a very substantial net loss and in addition, its problems were further compounded by operating

the leases by which the public investors had given the trailers to the company and to offer the trailer owners stock in this newly formed firm Capital

was on the assumption that they had only $750 in the trailer and he would therefore get 375 shares of capital stock.","start":950.886,"stop":959.688,"duration":8.8},{"text":"There was -- at this time, slightly more than $700,000 which the debtor then owed to these public investors.","start":959.688,"stop":968.069,"duration":8.38},{"text":"That was just eliminated, completely wiped
