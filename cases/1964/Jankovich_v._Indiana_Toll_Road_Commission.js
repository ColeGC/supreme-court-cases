two questions in this case.","start":19.987,"stop":23.26,"duration":3.27},{"text":"First, is a zoning ordinance which restricts the height of structures on land surrounding an airport for the purpose of maintaining safe and unobstructed aerial approaches, a taking of property which requires compensation and is therefore invalid.","start":23.26,"stop":45.025,"duration":21.76},{"text":"Second -- the Federal Aviation Agency.","start":45.025,"stop":53.546,"duration":8.52},{"text":"That's precisely what they call them in there too.","start":53.546,"stop":56.996,"duration":3.45},{"text":"The second question is whether an independent and adequate state ground exists which precludes this Court from deciding whether airport zoning is a constitutional exercise of governmental power.","start":56.996,"stop":72.615,"duration":15.62},{"text":"Now this is what happened.","start":72.615,"stop":75.091,"duration":2.48},{"text":"In 1939, the City of Gary enacted an ordinance which declared that it needs shall acquire and operate an airport.","start":75.091,"stop":85.616,"duration":10.53},{"text":"In 1947, they got the land for the operation of this airport.","start":85.616,"stop":90.43,"duration":4.81},{"text":"They got it from the United States.","start":90.43,"stop":93.374,"duration":2.94},{"text":"The grant from the United States read that the land was given for an inconsideration of the development and operation of the demised premises as a public airport in perpetuity and for the benefit which shall accrue to the United States from the continued use of such property as of airport.","start":93.374,"stop":114.415,"duration":21.04},{"text":"There was to be automatic reversion of the title to the land to the United States if and in the event that the administrator of Civil Aeronautics or his successors determine that the premises have not been developed for airport purposes within a reasonable time or that after having been so developed, they seize to be used for airport purposes.","start":114.415,"stop":136.314,"duration":21.9},{"text":"Gary promised that the airport will be operated as a public airport on fair and reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination.","start":136.314,"stop":146.597,"duration":10.28},{"text":"In 1948, one year later, Gary adapted a master airport plan.","start":146.597,"stop":152.648,"duration":6.05},{"text":"A plan called for the construction of three runways, an east-west runway which has not been constructed.","start":152.648,"stop":159.245,"duration":6.6},{"text":"A northwest-southeast runway which has been constructed but is not involved in this proceeding and a north-south runway which has been constructed and is the runway, we are particularly concerned with.","start":159.245,"stop":172.608,"duration":13.36},{"text":"In the construction of this airport, federal funds were used as well as municipal funds.","start":172.608,"stop":178.262,"duration":5.65},{"text":"The federal funds were obtained as a result of a grant agreement between the Civil Aeronautics Administration, the predecessor of the F.A.A. and Gary, under the Federal Airport Act.","start":178.262,"stop":192.097,"duration":13.84},{"text":"Now, in September of '49, about the time that airport construction was to begin, the City of Gary enacted an airport zoning ordinance.","start":192.097,"stop":204.541,"duration":12.44},{"text":"This airport zoning ordinance which appears on the record of page 151, divided the land on which the airport was located as well as all surrounding land within a distance of two miles from the proposed end of the runway into four zones.","start":204.541,"stop":224.796,"duration":20.25},{"text":"The zones were a turning zone, an outer area approach zone, an inner area approach zone and a transition zone.","start":224.796,"stop":235.817,"duration":11.02},{"text":"In the turning zone, the height limitation was 150 feet.","start":235.817,"stop":240.578,"duration":4.76},{"text":"The same height limitation pertained in the outer area approach zone.","start":240.578,"stop":245.551,"duration":4.97},{"text":"A particular zone we are concerned with is the inner area approach zone and the ordinance read this way, inner area approach zone as indicated extending 6,000 feet from the end of the proposed runway not to exceed height greater than permitted of 40-to-1 slope.","start":245.551,"stop":265.175,"duration":19.62},{"text":"Now, a 40-to-1 slope means that for every 40 feet that you go out horizontally, you go out one -- you go out one foot vertically.","start":265.175,"stop":276.074,"duration":10.9},{"text":"If this is your end of your proposed runway, you go 40 feet this way, you then go one foot of that way.","start":276.074,"stop":282.809,"duration":6.74},{"text":"Your glide angle is this line between the zero point and the one foot point.","start":282.809,"stop":290.156,"duration":7.35},{"text":"Now this glide angle continues out on the same line until it reaches 100 of the 6,000 foot mark, of that point, you have 150 feet here and your glide angle on your inner area approach zone is this line in here.","start":290.156,"stop":307.133,"duration":16.98},{"text":"If you went out another 40 feet, you get two feet elevation, another 40 feet you get three feet and so on until you run the 6,000 feet at which point you reach 150 feet elevation which is the same elevation as the turning zone and the outer area approach zone.","start":307.133,"stop":323.416,"duration":16.28},{"text":"There is finally a transition zone with a height limit based on a 7:1 slope which means for seven horizontal feet, you go up one foot vertically from the edge of the inner area approach zone to a maximum height of 150 feet.","start":323.416,"stop":341.339,"duration":17.92},{"text":"Now, perhaps a rough diagram will explain this a little bit better.","start":341.339,"stop":346.363,"duration":5.02},{"text":"You have your runway here.","start":346.363,"stop":350.901,"duration":4.54},{"text":"This is your north-south runway.","start":350.901,"stop":354.471,"duration":3.57},{"text":"At this point here, this is the end of the proposed runway, you go out two miles.","start":354.471,"stop":360.703,"duration":6.23},{"text":"Then you make a circle with the two miles and this entire circle which goes around the airport and the land surrounding it is your turning zone.","start":360.703,"stop":371.538,"duration":10.84},{"text":"The height limitation throughout this entire zone is 150 feet.","start":371.538,"stop":376.107,"duration":4.57},{"text":"Now, at the end of the proposed runway, you go 500 feet this way.","start":376.107,"stop":384.285,"duration":8.18},{"text":"At the end of the two miles, you go 2,500 feet this way.","start":384.285,"stop":392.777,"duration":8.49},{"text":"This is your approached surface.","start":392.777,"stop":395.4,"duration":2.62},{"text":"It flares out from 500 feet here to 2,500 feet there.","start":395.4,"stop":401.07,"duration":5.67},{"text":"Now along this two-mile line, you have the 6,000 feet that goes up for your 40-to-1 glide slope.","start":401.07,"stop":408.884,"duration":7.81},{"text":"This portion in here is your inner area approach zone.","start":408.884,"stop":413.213,"duration":4.33},{"text":"This portion here is your outer area approach zone.","start":413.213,"stop":416.339,"duration":3.13},{"text":"Your height limit here is 150 feet as it is throughout the rest of the turning zone.","start":416.339,"stop":421.989,"duration":5.65},{"text":"Within this area here, your height limit runs from zero at the end of the proposed runway to 150 feet depending where along the 6,000 feet you area.","start":421.989,"stop":432.038,"duration":10.05},{"text":"There is finally this transition zone.","start":432.038,"stop":434.999,"duration":2.96},{"text":"This is a zone which is something like that, declared as a 7:1 off the edge of the approached area and it stops at the point that you reach 150 feet so that you have a truck in here.","start":434.999,"stop":453.213,"duration":18.21},{"text":"The truck is made up of your 40-to-1 right angle and your transition zone at the side of it and this is your area approach zone, the plane comes in for landing circles on the turning zone and from within -- going out of this way.","start":453.213,"stop":474.291,"duration":21.08}]},{"speakerName":"William J.

zone is what its name says.","start":475.752,"stop":479.662,"duration":3.91},{"text":"It's a transition from the area approach zone to the turning zone.","start":479.662,"stop":485.668,"duration":6.01},{"text":"It's the area which tells you from your lower height limitation here to your 150 feet here.","start":485.668,"stop":492.686,"duration":7.02},{"text":"I'll try to explain this a little more later, but on this astray, your transition zone is the line, the 7-to-1 glide slope which indents from the area approach zone.","start":492.686,"stop":509.136,"duration":16.45}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Well then for all practical purposes, there are some portions of the

approach zone and transition zone start with zero.","start":519.11,"stop":524.702,"duration":5.59},{"text":"Now, in this case, I get a little ahead of it.","start":524.702,"stop":529.232,"duration":4.53},{"text":"The boundary of a Grand Calumet -- the boundary of the southern part of the airport is the Grand Calumet River.","start":529.232,"stop":538.451,"duration":9.22},{"text":"At the point that this ordinance begins to pinch a property owner, it is on this side of the Grand Calumet River.","start":538.451,"stop":546.245,"duration":7.79},{"text":"On this side of the Grand Calumet River, before the petitioners move the river 175 feet, the maximum height limitation was 22 and one half feet.","start":546.245,"stop":558.36,"duration":12.12},{"text":"So at the point that this ordinance begins to pinch, you can build structures up to 22 and one half feet but not in excess of 22

structures on the riverbed.","start":594.177,"stop":603.715,"duration":9.54},{"text":"So the point that it began to pinch -- adjacent property on this would be on this side of the riverbed.","start":603.715,"stop":610.089,"duration":6.37}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"And that's 22 and one half

right.","start":611.405,"stop":615.256,"duration":3.85},{"text":"Now, the ordinance provided that with respect to any existing structures at the time it was enacted, and with respect to any structures which could be completed within two years of the enactment of the ordinance, the zoning ordinance was to have no effect.","start":615.256,"stop":637.674,"duration":22.42},{"text":"If such structures were in excess of the height limitations, these were non-conforming uses and they would have to be tolerated.","start":637.674,"stop":644.91,"duration":7.24},{"text":"With respect to all other structures, they would be to comply with the height limitations except that this ordinance also provided for a variance.","start":644.91,"stop":654.878,"duration":9.97},{"text":"If the adjacent property owner could show particular hardship and that his building of a structure in excess of the height limit could be accommodated in keeping with the spirit and the purpose of the ordinance, a variance would be granted and this was the essential scheme of the ordinance.","start":654.878,"stop":671.214,"duration":16.34},{"text":"Now the reason for the ordinance as recited in the preamble is this; Airport hazards endanger the lives and property of the uses of the Gary Municipal Airport and the occupants of the land in its vicinity and in effect, the airport hazard, reduces the size of the area available for landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investments in it.","start":671.214,"stop":702.06,"duration":30.85},{"text":"The preamble went on to overcome these hazards.","start":702.06,"stop":705.569,"duration":3.51},{"text":"The Board of Aviation Commissioners of Gary adapted certain standards for the safe decent, landing and decent of aircraft for the proper and safe use of the airport and landing fields in respect to height and location of structures and use of land.","start":705.569,"stop":721.823,"duration":16.25},{"text":"And finally, the order that the preamble stated that the enactment of the ordinance was necessary in the interest of public health, public safety and general welfare to the end that creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented to the extent possible by exercise of the police power.","start":721.823,"stop":741.467,"duration":19.64},{"text":"One year later, in 1950, the lessees here, the petitioners entered into a lease agreement with Gary through the Board of Aviation Commissioners to operate this airport for 20 years with an option to renew for another 20 years and they invested about $400,000 to create the facilities necessary for the operation of an airport.","start":741.467,"stop":763.727,"duration":22.26},{"text":"And this was the situation which prevailed until 1954 or 1955, some four or five years later when the respondent, the Indiana Toll Road Commission came on to see.","start":763.727,"stop":776.669,"duration":12.94},{"text":"The respondent acquired a right of way during 1954 and 1955 for the construction of a toll road.","start":776.669,"stop":785.722,"duration":9.05},{"text":"The part of the toll road we are concerned with runs in an east-west direction along the south boundary of the airport process.","start":785.722,"stop":795.549,"duration":9.83},{"text":"It was a plot with a modification under the present -- toll road obstructs the property of the airport.","start":795.549,"stop":804.46,"duration":8.91},{"text":"Now, instead of building this toll road on this side of the river edge, the people building the toll road in fact moved the riverbed over by 175 feet, the width of the river, built that toll road on the riverbed and moved the river on to the airport property.","start":804.46,"stop":826.052,"duration":21.59},{"text":"They not only moved the river on to the airport property and built their toll road on the riverbed.","start":826.052,"stop":831.167,"duration":5.12},{"text":"They elevated the toll road 30 feet above the ground level of the riverbed.","start":831.167,"stop":837.882,"duration":6.71},{"text":"The consequence was that at the point that they built their toll road; the height limitation was a little more than 18 feet.","start":837.882,"stop":849.14,"duration":11.26},{"text":"They went up 30 feet.","start":849.14,"stop":850.72,"duration":1.58},{"text":"They penetrated the protected airspace by 12 feet.","start":850.72,"stop":854.383,"duration":3.66},{"text":"Had they stayed on this side of the riverbed they still would have penetrated the airspace but by less.","start":854.383,"stop":859.65,"duration":5.27},{"text":"On this side of the riverbed had they gone up 30 feet, they would have penetrated the airspace by 8 and one half.","start":859.65,"stop":867.316,"duration":7.67},{"text":"The practical consequence of penetrating the airspace is that before they violated the ordinance, you could fly plane on to this runway which were heavier than 15,000 pounds.","start":867.316,"stop":882.275,"duration":14.96},{"text":"After you put this toll road up there, you could no longer fly plane safely weighing more than 15,000 pounds on to this runway, the consequences obviously, loss of business.","start":882.275,"stop":895.85,"duration":13.58},{"text":"As a result, the lessees having been injured, damaged in their business, wrote a suit for injunctive relief and for damages based upon the violation of the ordinance.","start":895.85,"stop":908.776,"duration":12.93},{"text":"Now, the particular issue which we are concerned with today, first was raised in the Trial court in the course of trying this case when the petitioners moved or offered the ordinance into evidence.","start":908.776,"stop":928.417,"duration":19.64},{"text":"At this point, when the petitioners offered the ordinance into evidence, the respondents objected to its admission, stating that the ordinance was a legal note.","start":928.417,"stop":938.809,"duration":10.39},{"text":"And I think it's important to quote at this point precisely what they stated because this is the only contention that was ever raised either at the Trial court, or in the court below in the Indiana Supreme Court.","start":938.809,"stop":951.232,"duration":12.42},{"text":"This is the only question which is here today.","start":951.232,"stop":954.413,"duration":3.18},{"text":"This is what they stated in objecting to the offer of the ordinance into evidence.","start":954.413,"stop":959.473,"duration":5.06},{"text":"The attempt to establish glide angles or slopes in controlling the height of structures and objects near an airport by zoning, is the unconstitutional taking of property without payment of compensation and is offensive to and violative of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, and Article 1, Section 21 of the Constitution of the State of Indiana.","start":959.473,"stop":985.439,"duration":25.97},{"text":"The enactment of the purported airport zoning ordinance is an unlawful and
