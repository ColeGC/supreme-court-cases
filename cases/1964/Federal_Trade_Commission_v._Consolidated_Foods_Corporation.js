that I made yesterday, although it's not a point, it's not very essential.","start":13.547,"stop":24.849,"duration":11.3},{"text":"There is testimony in the record at page is 1664 and 1665, to the effect that in 1950 the wholesale grocery business was declining, and that Consolidated, then began to move into the retail field.","start":24.849,"stop":43.845,"duration":19},{"text":"It bought some chains which are identified in briefs.","start":43.845,"stop":48.2,"duration":4.36},{"text":"It also attempted to organize some retailers, and the Cardinal Stores on a somewhat loser basis without buying into them, but making them a chain that it would help to manage.","start":48.2,"stop":60.083,"duration":11.88},{"text":"As far as I can ascertain, the record does not show, how far Consolidated had become engaged in purchasing for resale at retail, and how far it was still purchasing for resale at wholesale, by the time this record was closed.","start":60.083,"stop":77.88,"duration":17.8},{"text":"But, I don't think the point is of the essence, because in any event it was a large buyer, and I suppose also we don't lay any stress on it, that it's power as a buyer for immediate sale at retail was perhaps more important than it's power as a buyer, as a wholesaler where it would have to buy what it could sell instead of choosing what went on shelves itself, but I don't make anything at that point.","start":77.88,"stop":103.234,"duration":25.35},{"text":"I just want to correct any misapprehension I might have left with the Court.","start":103.234,"stop":108.501,"duration":5.27},{"text":"Now, yesterday, I was directing myself throughout the argument to the question whether the commission was warranted, leaving the evidence of post-acquisition market behavior aside for the moment, was warranted in finding that this merger created a probable injury to competition, within the meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.","start":108.501,"stop":135.858,"duration":27.36},{"text":"In a nutshell, the case, I think comes down to this.","start":135.858,"stop":140.354,"duration":4.5},{"text":"The record shows, that Consolidated was a customer of concerns buying from 25% to 50% of the onion and garlic.","start":140.354,"stop":152.263,"duration":11.91},{"text":"Indeed, that it was a customer of firms buying 25% from the Gentry division, that became part of Consolidated.","start":152.263,"stop":163.541,"duration":11.28},{"text":"It was also a very large purchaser.","start":163.541,"stop":167.129,"duration":3.59},{"text":"In addition, the record shows that the merger gave Consolidated at the absolute dominant position in the onion and garlic market and as I said before, 25% of all sales were made to its customers.","start":167.129,"stop":186.516,"duration":19.39},{"text":"We also know as a matter of fact, that Consolidated was ready, able and willing, and it was ready and willing and at least in some cases able to use its purchasing power to acquire sales, to break into the new markets of garlic and onion.","start":186.516,"stop":208.087,"duration":21.57},{"text":"I think, we know as a matter of commonsense and of commercial experience, that buying power in other markets can be used and has been used in a number of instances with devastating affect in foreclosing the market you are concerned with, two independent competitors who lack that leverage.","start":208.087,"stop":230.694,"duration":22.61},{"text":"Now, we would say taking this together, and still for the moment, leaving aside the post-acquisition evidence, that it's indeed a necessary inference, that the combination of the two powers creates or may substantially lessen competition within the meaning of the statute.","start":230.694,"stop":253.442,"duration":22.75},{"text":"That it creates sufficient probability of injury to independent competitor to cause Section 7 to apply.","start":253.442,"stop":261.168,"duration":7.73},{"text":"That was the conclusion that the District Court and the Third Circuit reached in a comparable situation, in the Ingersoll Rand case cited in our briefs, but we don't need to go quite that far here.","start":261.168,"stop":273.205,"duration":12.04},{"text":"All we need to argue is that the Federal Trade Commission could draw this conclusion, because after all, the very purpose of creating the Federal Trade Commission, as this court pointed out in the Cement Institute case, I wish I'd quoted it in my brief, the whole purpose of setting up the commission was to have a body that was capable of appraising the affects.","start":273.205,"stop":300.046,"duration":26.84},{"text":"In that case, various competitive practices with Basing Point System, under Section 7 of the Clayton Act as amended of appraising the effects of various structural changes in the market, and what they were likely to do to competition.","start":300.046,"stop":315.56,"duration":15.51},{"text":"The commission, remember, was according to legislative history made the principal instrument for enforcing Section 7, so that it's expertise could be brought to bare.","start":315.56,"stop":326.794,"duration":11.23},{"text":"I think in the sense, the answer to the argument that the respondents make here, about there being no evidence concerning the degree of probability is that, the answer that was made in the Republic Aviation case in dealing with the Labor Board.","start":326.794,"stop":342.597,"duration":15.8},{"text":"There, the proof showed only that there was a company rule, barring the solicitation of union members of the plant and wearing of union buttons.","start":342.597,"stop":355.714,"duration":13.12},{"text":"And the company argued well there was no testimony concerning the extent to which this will interfere with union organization.","start":355.714,"stop":362.973,"duration":7.26},{"text":"And the company replies that, that's something -- the court replied that is something for an expert body like the Labor Board to infer from the facts, one of the purposes it said which lead to the creation of such boards is to have decisions based upon evidential facts under the particular statue, made by experienced officials with an adequate appreciation of the subject interested their administration.","start":362.973,"stop":389.243,"duration":26.27},{"text":"To move to still another area in the Market Street Railway case, it was held at a Public Utilities Commission could infer that a lowering of the rates, and being a fares on a Street Railway could infer without direct testimony that that would resolved in an increase of passenger traffic.","start":389.243,"stop":410.745,"duration":21.5},{"text":"And the same thing has been applied during the Cement Institute case, and in the Morton Salt case to the Federal Trade Commission.","start":410.745,"stop":418.887,"duration":8.14}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"[Inaudible] working

will elaborate is that we think that the evidence was relevant, but not such as to compel the conclusion that the threat to competition was not sufficiently substantial.","start":432.079,"stop":449.407,"duration":17.33},{"text":"The post-acquisition evidence falls essentially into two parts, one is the statistical part, showing that during the subsequent years, it's about seven years, seven-and-a-half years that in the garlic market, Consolidated lost shares.","start":449.407,"stop":475.02,"duration":25.61},{"text":"It didn't have as large a percentage as before.","start":475.02,"stop":478.095,"duration":3.08},{"text":"Indeed, the share fell from 51% to 39%.","start":478.095,"stop":484.082,"duration":5.99},{"text":"In the onion market,

the technological competition.","start":529.782,"stop":538.283,"duration":8.5},{"text":"We say essentially two things.","start":538.283,"stop":540.916,"duration":2.63},{"text":"First, we rely on the point the commission made that the failure to gain in both markets, a larger share maybe explainable only by the fact that Consolidated wasn't using all its power during this period, and we are concerned with power not actual consequences.","start":540.916,"stop":564.312,"duration":23.4},{"text":"Second, we suggest that the proof of the movement in the sales does not show that the reciprocal purchasing power was not operable as a factor.","start":564.312,"stop":581.414,"duration":17.1},{"text":"True, it is only one factor that comes into play, but we don't suggest that quality, price and things like that were not elements.","start":581.414,"stop":592.165,"duration":10.75},{"text":"Indeed in this respect, it seems to be and again I wish the case within our brief, that this case is very similar to the DuPont Case.","start":592.165,"stop":600.133,"duration":7.97},{"text":"There are other differences, but you'll recall it in the DuPont case the argument was made that DuPont did not enjoy a constant share of General Motor's business that after the acquisition at times it share declined and there was testimony and a finding by the District Court, that General Motors was concerned with price and quality, in purchasing its paints, the leather that it acquired from DuPont and others, but, the court said that all those facts didn't make any difference.","start":600.133,"stop":635.48,"duration":35.35},{"text":"That the evidence did show that DuPont by acquiring the General Motors Stock had acquired an ability to get sales on a basis other than price, quality, and the normal competitive thing.","start":635.48,"stop":649.547,"duration":14.07},{"text":"So, here we say that Consolidated had acquired that capacity, and it may well have been, that it used it in some instances and not in others.","start":649.547,"stop":663.131,"duration":13.58},{"text":"Now, as a matter of fact I think the evidence very strongly suggests that it may well have been holding some sales in acquiring others on the basis of its purchasing power.","start":663.131,"stop":674.644,"duration":11.51},{"text":"So, far as the garlic went, there was testimony by Dr. Prater to the affect that for many years they've been the leader in garlic, had the best quality and the largest share, but that they lost that because they had not spend the time, money and effort, and had not built a separate plant to handle garlic, had not carried on research.","start":674.644,"stop":696.838,"duration":22.19},{"text":"So, it's not surprising that they lost sales, even though this was a factor in the market.","start":696.838,"stop":702.899,"duration":6.06},{"text":"On the other hand, if you turn and look at the onions, they were gaining sales 7% of the whole, an additional 25% over what they had.","start":702.899,"stop":717.34,"duration":14.44},{"text":"It's suggested in the brief of the company, well, the figures don't show that purchasing power had -- and it came into play because we sold on 33% of the whole market in 1936, and we sold only 31% and lower percentages of the sales, of the groups of companies who were our suppliers in the processed foods market.","start":717.34,"stop":746.272,"duration":28.93},{"text":"Now, of course, all that shows is that there were some people who bought Consolidated's onions, who bought more than 33% of their onions from the Consolidated.","start":746.272,"stop":757.027,"duration":10.75},{"text":"I think, the really important test would be how did Consolidated fair among its suppliers, where its purchasing power might come into play as compared to the part of the market which apparently was not its suppliers.","start":757.027,"stop":773.13,"duration":16.1},{"text":"Now, we do know who its suppliers were in this period.","start":773.13,"stop":777.78,"duration":4.65},{"text":"We don't know what they bought in particular years, but it's a constant universe, and the figures are quite interesting.","start":777.78,"stop":785.294,"duration":7.51},{"text":"In 1951, the sales to those who were Consolidated suppliers, were one million eight roughly and the sales to others who were not among its suppliers, where one million seven.","start":785.294,"stop":799.647,"duration":14.35},{"text":"By 1955, the sales to its suppliers were 2 billion 5, that's a 35% increase and the sales to others were down to one million three, a 30% decrease.","start":799.647,"stop":816.206,"duration":16.56},{"text":"By 1958, the sales to suppliers were up to four million six that would be a 146% increase over 1951, and the sales to others were down to one million six, still not what they were in 1951.","start":816.206,"stop":836.9,"duration":20.69},{"text":"Now, 1951 may not be an entirely reliable base year.","start":836.9,"stop":841.886,"duration":4.99},{"text":"So I ran a similar check taking 1950 as a base.","start":841.886,"stop":846.552,"duration":4.67},{"text":"You find that Consolidated Gentry sales rose from two million one to six million – looks as if I must made a mistake, to six million two -- oh!","start":846.552,"stop":860.763,"duration":14.21},{"text":"That's the total, from two million one to six million two and that 80% of that was attributable to set sales to Consolidated suppliers.","start":860.763,"stop":871.682,"duration":10.92},{"text":"So, it was doing much better in the market where it did have this -- in the part of the market where it did have this leverage, so far as onion went, then it was in the other part.","start":871.682,"stop":881.321,"duration":9.64},{"text":"And of course any technological change would be operable in both parts.","start":881.321,"stop":885.476,"duration":4.15},{"text":"Now, I don't contend, I want to make it very clear, that this shows the reciprocal purchasing power at work, because the commission didn't find that.","start":885.476,"stop":896.643,"duration":11.17},{"text":"All I argue is that this shows that the post-acquisition evidence isn't very compelling, that you could draw various inferences from it.","start":896.643,"stop":908.339,"duration":11.7},{"text":"That it says sort of [Inaudible] you can look at it one way or look at it another way, and that consequently commission were simply entitled to take into account along with the risk, that they concluded that ultimate question was whether an improper power carrying sufficient probability of injury had been interjected into this market.","start":908.339,"stop":932.995,"duration":24.66},{"text":"Now the other part of the testimony concerning the post-acquisition period was direct evidence from various suppliers to Consolidated and purchasers of onions and garlic from Consolidated, saying well, we weren't influenced by the threats of purchasing power.","start":932.995,"stop":954.65,"duration":21.65},{"text":"To that very briefly, we give much the same answer that we gave in the case of the statistics.","start":954.65,"stop":961.988,"duration":7.34},{"text":"First, we say, that there were instances where admittedly its purchasing power did pry open the market.","start":961.988,"stop":971.844,"duration":9.86},{"text":"Second, we say, that if you look at all the evidence with respect to the firms that testified, that they were influenced by Consolidated's purchasing power.","start":971.844,"stop":985.06,"duration":13.22},{"text":"You find a number of instances where they was controversy, where they was other testimony that threw doubt on that direct evidence.","start":985.06,"stop":992.835,"duration":7.78},{"text":"That's particularly true in the case Gerber's Foods and the Morgan Packing Company.","start":992.835,"stop":998.165,"duration":5.33},{"text":"So that again we think, first of the instances in which it countered the purchasing power are more important than the instances in which it didn't, because those were the proofs that there was some power and second, it adds to the other, again to inquire into the particular facts in the post-acquisition period, which isn't too long when one thinks of being probable life of this industry in the long run development, that the commission was certainly entitled to hold fast to those facts that where known about market structure, and it based conclusion upon them, instead of being compelled to disregard to compelled by the debatable post-acquisition evidence to reach a contrary conclusion.","start":998.165,"stop":1045.921,"duration":47.76},{"text":"I would like Mr. Chief Justice to save what time I've left for

the importance of preserving opportunities for new entry in fields so they are already heavily concentrated.","start":944.303,"stop":978.817,"duration":34.51},{"text":"And finally the Commission noted

the ultimate question is this, was the Commission warranted in finding that the merger created a sufficient probability of substantial injury to competition by putting Consolidated in a position where its buying power by influence suppliers to purchase Gentry onions and garlic, Consolidated's onions and garlic instead of those offered by competitors and that question comes out with three things that are important, really beyond dispute.","start":1091.627,"stop":1132.141,"duration":40.51},{"text":"First it is beyond dispute I submit that the Commission did make that critical
