turn briefly to certain points raised by the Court of Appeals and the State of Ohio.","start":830.373,"stop":839.374,"duration":9},{"text":"One is, there are some talk in the -- in that decision, that the personal property of domestic insurance company is not expressly exempted (Inaudible) -- exempted in quotes does not say in so many word in -- does not use the word exempt but the effect is equally clear is a -- domestic insurance company is excluded and it does use that word from the definition of a taxpayer under the personal property tax and the franchise tax laws says that it is in lieu of all other taxes.","start":839.374,"stop":869.368,"duration":29.99},{"text":"So it's perfectly clear that a domestic insurance company does not pay a personal property tax on this personal property.","start":869.368,"stop":879.696,"duration":10.33},{"text":"Secondly, there is the possibility alluded to of an equalizing tax.","start":879.696,"stop":885.287,"duration":5.59},{"text":"Some other form of tax that makes up for this fact and as for that reason that we have explained the real estate tax, the intangible personal property tax, and the franchise tax, to show clearly that there is no tax that an Ohio company pays that a foreign company does not pay that would act as a balancing feature, none whatsoever.","start":885.287,"stop":910.414,"duration":25.13},{"text":"The Court of Appeals mentions the possibility of reasonable classifications and of course a state may classify companies and it may have for instance a different type of tax on utilities or it may have as Ohio has chosen to have for its domestic company the different type of tax for insurance companies that it has for manufacturing companies.","start":910.414,"stop":934.756,"duration":24.34},{"text":"But there is no difference here between the foreign insurance company and the domestic one except the residence of the company.","start":934.756,"stop":946.176,"duration":11.42},{"text":"And again, I would like to make a quote from the Wheeling Steel case.","start":946.176,"stop":951.823,"duration":5.65},{"text":"This is at 572, “If on the taxing date, one of these petitioners and an Ohio competitor --” one of these petitions that were two cases is actually litigating the Wheeling Steel case.","start":951.823,"stop":962.424,"duration":10.6},{"text":"“One of this petitioners and an Ohio competitor each owns an accounts receivable of the same amount from the same out-of-state customer for the same type of commodity, both shipped from the manufacturing plant in Ohio and both sold out of Ohio by an agent having an office out-of-the state.","start":962.424,"stop":977.274,"duration":14.85},{"text":"Appellant's account receivable would be subject to Ohio's ad valorem tax and the one held by the competing domestic corporation would not.","start":977.274,"stop":985.076,"duration":7.8},{"text":"It seems obvious that appellants are not accorded equal treatment and the inequality is not because of the slightest deference in Ohio's relationship -- relation to the decisive transaction, but solely because of the different residence of the owner.”","start":985.076,"stop":1000.115,"duration":15.04},{"text":"And we submit that the exact same situation is here.","start":1000.115,"stop":1005.868,"duration":5.75},{"text":"One or two other brief references, there's a sort of a suggestion in the Court of Appeals that maybe it's necessary to look to Texas law and see if there are some sort of balancing feature there.","start":1005.868,"stop":1015.849,"duration":9.98},{"text":"But it's clear I think that Texas law could not tax in any way personal property in Ohio and the only law that Texas has that has any bearing on an Ohio insurance company is a so-called Retaliatory Tax Law.","start":1015.849,"stop":1033.489,"duration":17.64},{"text":"Ohio has this, almost all state possibly all, but I know almost all states have this Retaliatory Tax Law.","start":1033.489,"stop":1040.724,"duration":7.23},{"text":"And what they say is, “That if another state taxes an Ohio Insurance Company to do business there at a greater rate than Ohio tax is that other state's company doing business in Ohio, and Ohio shall impose the same tax on a company of another state doing business in Ohio as that other state imposes on an Ohio company.”","start":1040.724,"stop":1065.739,"duration":25.02},{"text":"Now, Texas has that law but this cannot at all affect the personal property tax.","start":1065.739,"stop":1072.801,"duration":7.06},{"text":"Oh, I might say by way of passing that because of the discriminatory Ohio franchise tax, there is at least one company in Ohio, insurance company that pays in 33 other states, not on the basis of their franchise tax but on the basis of their Retaliatory Tax because Ohio's tax on other companies doing business in Ohio is so much higher.","start":1072.801,"stop":1098.65,"duration":25.85},{"text":"The Court of Appeals also indicates that there might be some difficulty in granting us the relief we asked even if we're entitled to it.","start":1098.65,"stop":1106.734,"duration":8.08},{"text":"This seems a little bit weird but there doesn't appeared to be any difficulty, if this Court should nullify the tax then we just wouldn't have to pay it and if Ohio wants to -- if Ohio legislature wants to look at its tax structure again, it could, but there's no difficulty in bringing this about.","start":1106.734,"stop":1126.81,"duration":20.08},{"text":"In one final argument which is raised by the appellee in its answer brief here, and that is essentially that since it may discriminate against us in regard to a franchise tax, why it may discriminate against us in any other form if wants to in addition?","start":1126.81,"stop":1146.996,"duration":20.19},{"text":"Now, this also seems very strange.","start":1146.996,"stop":1150.666,"duration":3.67},{"text":"It would indicate that they could discriminate against us if this argument were adopted, the real state tax, type of gasoline taxes we would pay, anything at all.","start":1150.666,"stop":1160.992,"duration":10.33},{"text":"In addition to the logical difficulty, it seems clear that this Court not only in the Wheeling Steel case but also in the Hanover Insurance Company Case, Hanover Fire Insurance Company versus Harding held exactly to the contrary and I made this quotation from the Wheeling Steel case
