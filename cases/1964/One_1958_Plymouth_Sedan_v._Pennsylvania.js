stopping of the -- and0 a search of the car was the broad statement by the Superior Court that under the circumstances, they opinioned that search and seizure were reasonable.","start":705.154,"stop":724.343,"duration":19.19},{"text":"They apparently suggested that because this was December the 16th, near a holiday season, they could take judicial notice of the fact that automobiles would be transporting illegal liquor from New Jersey into Pennsylvania.","start":724.343,"stop":740.374,"duration":16.03},{"text":"I think that the dissenting opinions in that court lay that question to rest.","start":740.374,"stop":747.524,"duration":7.15},{"text":"The Superior Court majority also points out that the -- there was a very skimpy record here made in the trial

government did not sustain its burden of proving that the car had been used illegally or that there was any probable cause for stopping the car at that

police picture of the driver of the car.","start":799.318,"stop":803.402,"duration":4.08},{"text":"They knew that he had a record and they had some information about his activities.","start":803.402,"stop":810.071,"duration":6.67},{"text":"In this case, we have none of that whatsoever.","start":810.071,"stop":812.826,"duration":2.75},{"text":"We have no prior

courtroom, any evidence direct or circumstantial arising from that search and seizure, then we would be forced to strike from the record here, almost all of pages 4, 5 and 6 in which the officer testified to what he observed and then the only thing left in the record would be the bald statement that a car was traveling from New Jersey to Philadelphia and that it was stopped.","start":846.297,"stop":887.144,"duration":40.85},{"text":"If you strike from the record all observations of the liquor which was seized after the stopping of the car and the arrest of the

Pennsylvania.","start":887.144,"stop":910.497,"duration":23.35},{"text":"Now the rationale of the Mapp case, the reason for the decision in the Mapp case according to this Court appears to be that it is to deter official governmental lawlessness, to remove the incentive for governmental violations of the Constitution.","start":910.497,"stop":935.007,"duration":24.51},{"text":"To allow the government to benefit from its lawlessness here in stopping this car by seizing that car and taking the car for its own benefit is to leave the same incentive which this Court in Mapp tried to remove.","start":935.007,"stop":956.276,"duration":21.27},{"text":"True, they're not using the car in evidence against the driver.","start":956.276,"stop":960.876,"duration":4.6},{"text":"They are not

automobile.","start":964.991,"stop":973.25,"duration":8.26},{"text":"If it is not usable against him, under the Fourteenth Amendment, it should equally be unusable against him to forfeit his property.","start":973.25,"stop":983.831,"duration":10.58},{"text":"Whether we call this a quasi criminal case or whether we analogize a forfeiture proceeding to a penalty, a criminal proceeding, we still come to the same conclusion that to allow the illegally seized evidence to be used in this proceeding in court, would be to take a man's property without the due process -- without the factors which this Court said, fall within the concept of ordered liberty, by permitting the exclusionary rule not to apply here.","start":983.831,"stop":1022.041,"duration":38.21}]},{"speakerName":"Potter
