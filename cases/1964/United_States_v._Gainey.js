the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, but before going any further, I think I should emphasize several things.","start":306.306,"stop":322.406,"duration":16.1},{"text":"First, though there

Appeals that it is impossible to tell to what extent, if any, the jury relied on the presumptions in finding the verdict guilty and that therefore, if the presumptions are indeed unconstitutional, a new trial is in order, that a new trial is permissible since there was sufficient other evidence.","start":340.554,"stop":365.81,"duration":25.26},{"text":"On the other hand, we find out that there was a general sentence as to all three petitioners and that therefore, the judgment of the District Court and the sentence can be sustained and should be sustained if the conviction on either Count 1 or Count 2 is sustained, that is to say if either of the presumptions underlying either of those counts is sustained.","start":365.81,"stop":394.187,"duration":28.38},{"text":"And finally, we emphasize that the two presumptions involved here, the one going to possession, the other going to carrying on the business to the distiller without bond, do not stand or fall together.","start":394.187,"stop":406.473,"duration":12.29},{"text":"We view them quite differently and as I hope to make it clear and as I think our brief says quite forthrightly, we view one as much stronger than the other and we place our primary reliance on that presumption which operates with respect to the substantive offense of carrying on the business without bond rather than on the presumption dealing with possession of an elicit still.","start":406.473,"stop":438.357,"duration":31.88},{"text":"The presumptions involved that I already described that I should state them a little more in detail.","start":438.357,"stop":448.63,"duration":10.27},{"text":"First, the statute says that as to anyone found present at the sites of an unregistered still, which is set up, that is to say which is ready for operation, the jury may infer that he, the person found there, is the possessor of the illicit still, if that person does not satisfactorily in their view explain his presence.","start":448.63,"stop":486.326,"duration":37.7},{"text":"The second presumption is that as to anyone found at the site of an elicit still which is not only set up, but which is also going, the jury is entitled to infer that that person is carrying on the business or of course aiding and/or abetting in carrying on the business of a distiller without bond and as I say it is as to the second presumption that we feel we have a stronger and a clear case.","start":486.326,"stop":525.202,"duration":38.88},{"text":"The standard under which these presumptions are to be tested are not really in dispute.","start":525.202,"stop":531.822,"duration":6.62},{"text":"I think the rule is so well settled by decisions of this Court that no issue of it is made here.","start":531.822,"stop":542.584,"duration":10.76},{"text":"The basic test as reiterated in those decisions is that there must be some rational connection between the fact proved, a fact which gives rise to the operation of the presumption and the fact inferred, the ultimate fact, in light of common experience.","start":542.584,"stop":566.631,"duration":24.05},{"text":"In judging the presumptions here because they all created by Congress and because they are not merely permissible inferences which a court finds reasonable if made by a jury, there is a special difference due to the congressional judgment.","start":566.631,"stop":585.383,"duration":18.75},{"text":"But the question merely is, was it reasonable for Congress to suppose that a jury might reasonably infer from presence under the stated circumstances that the person found there was aiding and abetting in the distilling without bond.","start":585.383,"stop":607.74,"duration":22.36},{"text":"We recognize also of course that the presumptions must not operate in such a way as to deprive the defendant of his privilege not to take the stand or otherwise place him at an unfair disadvantage.","start":607.74,"stop":627.017,"duration":19.28},{"text":"I should emphasize that the presumptions we're dealing with here are merely permissive, not only are they rebuttable presumptions, but they're permissive in the sense as the judge clearly instructed here, they're none binding on the jury.","start":627.017,"stop":642.234,"duration":15.22},{"text":"He tells them, “If you find these people were present and if you are not satisfied with their explanation, you'd still need not convict them, but you may do so.”","start":642.234,"stop":657.119,"duration":14.88},{"text":"The explanation referred to in the statute is also quite clear.","start":657.119,"stop":661.836,"duration":4.72},{"text":"It was quite clearly charged in this case, need not come from the defendant himself.","start":661.836,"stop":667.415,"duration":5.58},{"text":"There was a suggestion that the defendant must himself take the stand to rebutt the inference that arises.","start":667.415,"stop":674.563,"duration":7.15},{"text":"That rebuttal may come from any evidence he chooses to introduce, many witnesses that may put on.","start":674.563,"stop":682.248,"duration":7.69},{"text":"Indeed it may come from any circumstances in the case, including the government's own evidence.","start":682.248,"stop":687.944,"duration":5.7},{"text":"There well be that the government's proof will show circumstances which on their face explain the presence of the defendant site and from the very start make the inference impossible or unlikely.","start":687.944,"stop":706.434,"duration":18.49}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"[Inaudible]","start":706.434,"stop":724.436,"duration":18}]},{"speakerName":"Louis F.
