elements of custody in it.","start":333.484,"stop":338.703,"duration":5.22},{"text":"The issue here is simply, whether a Court can completely cut the man off from his own child without even the right

his will without even notice.","start":338.703,"stop":361.454,"duration":22.75},{"text":"The procedural facts are as follows.","start":361.454,"stop":364.195,"duration":2.74},{"text":"With one small
