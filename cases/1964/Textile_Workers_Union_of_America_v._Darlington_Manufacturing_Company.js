possible way that it could stay in business was to have modern machinery and to have -- make a more effective use of this labor.","start":4633.168,"stop":4644.844,"duration":11.68},{"text":"And so, Darlington called in this engineering firm, because Darlington, only had been making two and eight tenth percent upon this investment during those

that was contemplated an expenditure of $400,000 to modernize its mill and it took in full concrete flooring to support some of these looms, to have the modern speed looms and what had been a supply

firm.","start":4674.68,"stop":4699.884,"duration":25.2},{"text":"And it was embarked on this expenditure of $400,000 recognizing that they had the modernize machinery and they had to make a more

opposed any change in job assignments.","start":4715.001,"stop":4723.243,"duration":8.24},{"text":"They wanted the management to carry on in the old way and although Darlington spent thousands of dollars in an attempt to modernize its carving room and its spinning room, that it didn't get the economic results from it, because of the reluctance of the minority of these employees to do -- to engage in a more efficient labor and the use of more machinery.","start":4723.243,"stop":4749.909,"duration":26.67},{"text":"Now, this was a substantial outlay for Darlington, because this total property at that time was betted at only $2,100,000.","start":4749.909,"stop":4759.81,"duration":9.9},{"text":"And so, then the union came up on the scene and started the organizing campaign just about the time that the results of the American, of the subsidy program started to take an effect.","start":4759.81,"stop":4772.909,"duration":13.1},{"text":"And the union promised these people and they won the election on the basis of their promises that they would see to it that the management made no changes in the job assignments there.","start":4772.909,"stop":4784.077,"duration":11.17},{"text":"In other words, the union pledged these people that Darlington, that it would, if the union won, they told them that if the union won, that Darlington could never go out of business not even until the last lingering echo of Gabriel's horn sounded.","start":4784.077,"stop":4800.712,"duration":16.64},{"text":"They told them that they'll see that, that the only program that was possible to save Darlington economically was never cut out.","start":4800.712,"stop":4808.131,"duration":7.42},{"text":"That is the more efficient use of labor in connection with new machinery and as a result of the decline on the products of Darlington, they discovered that they were suffering a substantial loss because there was a decrease of $0.06 a pound in the 7900 pounds of textile products they produced during the period between January and September of 1956.","start":4808.131,"stop":4839.681,"duration":31.55},{"text":"In addition to that, the administration had promised to do something about the importation of cheaply manufactured textile products from abroad, the rest was all from Japan where the workers got $0.12.5 an hour or 10% of that then paid in the American industry and that area of this country.","start":4839.681,"stop":4860.791,"duration":21.11},{"text":"And as a result of that promise, the sort of manufacturers agreed that they'll have a general raise.","start":4860.791,"stop":4866.535,"duration":5.74},{"text":"And as Darlington had stayed in business, even in the absence of the union, it would have made,

year.","start":4866.535,"stop":4882.212,"duration":15.68},{"text":"Now Darlington, had been making about $80,000 a year which is less than two and eight-tenths percent on this investment during the preceding five years.","start":4882.212,"stop":4893.446,"duration":11.23},{"text":"And if it is going to account as a modernization program, it not only had to make this expenditure of above $400,000, but it had to take in effect other expenditures, because with the change of technology and with the change of styles and with automation, there's a great change that had come into the industry.","start":4893.446,"stop":4913.758,"duration":20.31},{"text":"For example, Darlington had been specializing among other things in the making of PK and as a result of the technological change, his competitors had bought machinery in which they could avoid the expenses as the manufacturer.","start":4913.758,"stop":4930.858,"duration":17.1},{"text":"Buy new machines through which they could run any kind of cheaply made cloth and make the same effect, get the same effect as PK without the elaborate processes which Darlington had.","start":4930.858,"stop":4942.844,"duration":11.99},{"text":"Furthermore, the customers on the market stopped buying -- became in this favor, the woven cloth upon the narrow looms, the only kind Darlington had.","start":4942.844,"stop":4953.303,"duration":10.46},{"text":"And as a part of this program for modernization it had purchased and had on hand at that time for installation in the newly

on top of this, they found themselves confronted by the necessity even in the absence of the union of increasing wages of $120,000.","start":4973.505,"stop":4983.393,"duration":9.89},{"text":"They found they were going to sustain a loss as a result of the decline of their products of $240,000.","start":4983.393,"stop":4991.2,"duration":7.81},{"text":"Then, they also knew that they were going to have to spend $800,000 in the near future if they stayed in business to air-condition the plant and make other vast improvements in order to increase the wide looms above 80, the number 80 they didn't have on hand.","start":4991.2,"stop":5007.985,"duration":16.78},{"text":"And on top of this situation, this company was confronted by the advent of the union, which had pledged itself to the people
