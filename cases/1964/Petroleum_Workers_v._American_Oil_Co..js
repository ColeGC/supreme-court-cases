refinery in Whiting, Indiana, had a collective bargaining agreement with the employer, which provided in very broad terms that any questions at all arising during the term of the agreement and specifically questions pertaining to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of the employment not covered by the contract could be processed, those questions could be processed during the term of the agreement through the grievance procedure and be taken to arbitration.","start":70.897,"stop":119.882,"duration":48.99},{"text":"Here, they used to arbitrate what the wager

of past practice, custom, or usage relative to working conditions.","start":126.265,"stop":168.246,"duration":41.98},{"text":"This cause remained in the agreement, virtually unchanged in successive agreements from 1952 on.","start":168.246,"stop":177.502,"duration":9.26},{"text":"It also provided that with respect to matters not covered by the agreement in the area of wages, hours, and working

strike.","start":195.372,"stop":203.338,"duration":7.97},{"text":"This was the form of the grievance procedure language in the agreement of March 1957, which was the first agreement with which we're concerned here.","start":203.338,"stop":218.618,"duration":15.28},{"text":"During that time -- term of that agreement, there arose a grievance filed by certain Cement Finishers, now called the Cement Finishers' grievance, who claimed that the company by contracting out certain cement finishing work had violated the terms of the agreement and specifically the recognition clause and had violated past practice which was that this kind of work should always be done by employees in the bargaining union.","start":218.618,"stop":252.775,"duration":34.16},{"text":"The case was carried through the

law.","start":275.621,"stop":284.502,"duration":8.88},{"text":"The Court of Appeals relied particularly upon the then Fifth Circuit decision in the Warrior & Gulf case as well as in the First Circuit's decision of the Local 201 case, which said that no grievance was arbitrable unless the Court could find a governing provision in the contract which would guide the arbitrator to dispose of the grievance.","start":284.502,"stop":309.882,"duration":25.38},{"text":"That decision came down in March 1960, whereas this Court on June 20th, 1960 reversed the Warrior & Gulf decision of the Fifth

been followed in the federal courts ever since.","start":309.882,"stop":338.984,"duration":29.1},{"text":"Subsequent to the Court's decision, this Court's decision in March of 1960, two things

case.","start":377.056,"stop":383.77,"duration":6.71},{"text":"The first claim was that the company was obligated to arbitrate the union's claim that it had violated the agreement and specifically the recognition clause by giving the work, the crane work, to an outside contractor.","start":383.77,"stop":404.549,"duration":20.78},{"text":"The second paragraph of the complaint was broken into two paragraphs.","start":404.549,"stop":409.428,"duration":4.88},{"text":"Claim that the company had violated past practice, that the past practice was to have this work done by the crane operators employed by the company and the union asked that that claim be arbitrated.","start":409.428,"stop":425.024,"duration":15.6},{"text":"After an answer was filed, a motion for summary judgment was filed by the union on paragraph 1, the complaint asking arbitration of the claim of violation of the agreement.","start":425.024,"stop":439.542,"duration":14.52},{"text":"The defendant company filed a motion for summary judgment asking that both paragraphs of the complaint be dismissed.","start":439.542,"stop":449.008,"duration":9.47},{"text":"The District Court held that the dispute was an arbitrable dispute under the decision of this Court in the Warrior & Gulf and American Manufacturing cases and ordered the defendant to arbitrate the grievance, the entire grievance but it rested that entirely on paragraph 1 of the complaint and dismissed paragraph 2 as moot and denied of course the defendant's motion for summary judgment.","start":449.008,"stop":480.398,"duration":31.39},{"text":"The defendant appealed.","start":480.398,"stop":482.211,"duration":1.81},{"text":"The Court of Appeals held on appeal, reversing the District Court, first, that this dispute was not an arbitrable dispute.","start":482.211,"stop":493.148,"duration":10.94},{"text":"And I will not try to paraphrase the reasoning in the Court of Appeals but basically I think it was that it could not find any governing provision in the agreement which would govern an arbitrator's disposition of the case and therefore, there was nothing to arbitrate.","start":493.148,"stop":513.866,"duration":20.72},{"text":"It characterized as a rather strong language the union's contention that its claim that the company violated the agreement made the dispute arbitrable.","start":513.866,"stop":529.637,"duration":15.77},{"text":"It held as an alternate holding that the prior decision in the Cement Finishers' case constituted a collateral estoppel which prevented the union from processing this grievance or indeed any other grievance involving the contracting out of work, and this Court of course granted certiorari.","start":529.637,"stop":552.58,"duration":22.94},{"text":"Now, if Your Honors please, I think this case is a very simple and easy case because I think it is governed fully and without reasonable possibility of distinction by the two decisions which this Court issued in June of 1960.","start":552.58,"stop":569.749,"duration":17.17},{"text":"In the American Manufacturing case, this Court held that where the parties have agreed that questions of interpretation or application or claimed violation of an agreement, are to be determined by an arbitrator.","start":569.749,"stop":586.994,"duration":17.25},{"text":"Then when the union makes such a claim, that is that the employer violated the agreement and that the employer is wrong, action was erroneous as a matter of interpretation or application of the agreement then that claim is entitled to be arbitrated because that's what the parties have said, that any such claim shall be arbitrated.","start":586.994,"stop":615.919,"duration":28.92},{"text":"The Court in passing on the question of arbitrability, this Court said does not have to decide whether there is merit in the grievance or whether in its view, the contract covers the grievance or not.","start":615.919,"stop":630.009,"duration":14.09},{"text":"The question which is to be arbitrated is whether is the claim which the union has made that the company violated the agreement.","start":630.009,"stop":640.638,"duration":10.63},{"text":"The measurement is not to be made in the terms of subject matter or anything else but in terms of what the union's claim is, i.e. what is the arbitrator to decide.","start":640.638,"stop":651.452,"duration":10.81},{"text":"And just so in this case, the union is asked to have arbitrated its claim that the company's action violated the agreement and this Court said, it is not part of any court's business to decide whether there is merit in that claim or not.","start":651.452,"stop":670.773,"duration":19.32},{"text":"The Court -- the only function of the Court is to determine whether the employer has agreed to arbitrate such claims.","start":670.773,"stop":682.261,"duration":11.49},{"text":"The other part of this case is the claim that the company violated, if it did not violate the agreement, violated a past practice,
