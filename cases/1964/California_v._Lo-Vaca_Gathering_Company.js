Nevada.","start":361.183,"stop":368.623,"duration":7.44},{"text":"Most of that purchased by the navy was for its own users, but about 17% was used for resale to residents of a housing

jurisdictional.","start":380.491,"stop":387.134,"duration":6.64},{"text":"And it brushed off with a single work unsubstantial, a claim that the sale was not jurisdictional because California Electric

fact of resale of some portion of the electric energy transmitted from a state to a point outside thereof invokes federal jurisdiction at the

“nonjurisdictional”.","start":419.312,"stop":452.391,"duration":33.08},{"text":"The Court citing its own opinion in the Penn Water case at 343 U.S. strongly implied that such a segregation would not have been available to split an interstate from an intrastate's dream of gas or power.","start":452.391,"stop":475.734,"duration":23.34},{"text":"But it did question as to whether or not the problem

jurisdictional and the other which would not be jurisdictional.","start":502.861,"stop":531.243,"duration":28.38},{"text":"Thus, a pipeline at the end of its pipeline might take the gas which should

lower court's opinion for this decision is the case in the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals called State of North Dakota against the Federal Power Commission, which is discussed at considerable length in the briefs.","start":594.676,"stop":618.562,"duration":23.89},{"text":"And which may possibly represent a peculiar situation in which it limited amount of segregation, if you want to use the word, is possible in the intrastate field.","start":618.562,"stop":635.103,"duration":16.54},{"text":"The facts there were that the Montana-Dakota Pipeline was buying gas from one source in Montana.","start":635.103,"stop":647.746,"duration":12.64},{"text":"It was buying gas at the so-called Tioga Station.","start":647.746,"stop":653.439,"duration":5.69},{"text":"All of its gas came from there.","start":653.439,"stop":655.58,"duration":2.14},{"text":"The gas actually previously was 85% from Amerada and 15% from Cigna.","start":655.58,"stop":663.191,"duration":7.61},{"text":"But all the gas they purchased was at that point.","start":663.191,"stop":666.243,"duration":3.05},{"text":"They bought it under two contracts; one of which was admittedly for intrasta – interstate, and the other of which was restricted for intrastate deals.","start":666.243,"stop":679.165,"duration":12.92},{"text":"Most of the intrastate gas actually went over a separate line which didn't get out of the state at all.","start":679.165,"stop":686.308,"duration":7.14},{"text":"But some of the intrastate gas traveled along with the interstate gas in a line which extended into Wyoming and was siphoned off before it got to Wyoming into four small North Dakota communities.","start":686.308,"stop":705.743,"duration":19.44},{"text":"And the Court, the Eight Circuit held in that case that those sales were intrastate commerce because they were made in the State of North Dakota and never got outside of the State of North Dakota.","start":705.743,"stop":722.463,"duration":16.72},{"text":"Well, it's perfectly clear I think from my recital of the facts that the reason that they were able to do so was that you didn't have between the Tioga plant and the four laterals to these North Dakota communities intervening parties coming in and bringing gas.","start":722.463,"stop":748.699,"duration":26.24},{"text":"So that it was fair to say, that all of the gas sold at the Tioga plant for intrastate sale and no other gas was the gas that got into these four laterals.","start":748.699,"stop":765.012,"duration":16.31},{"text":"The problem, I suggest, would be analogous to this case.","start":765.012,"stop":769.833,"duration":4.82},{"text":"If instead of the complex arrangements we had, we had only the two Lo-Vaca contracts and the “nonjurisdictional” one was limited to the gas used at the Coquat station and a route to Sonora.","start":769.833,"stop":785.109,"duration":15.28},{"text":"In other words, it was gas which had to be from Lo-Vaca because there was no other gas coming in to the picture.","start":785.109,"stop":792.562,"duration":7.45},{"text":"That would be the North Dakota case presented here.","start":792.562,"stop":800.01,"duration":7.45},{"text":"And since that's the case, we don't have to get in to the separate problem of whether or not the North Dakota case is right or not since it again depends on what this Court in California said it was probably not possible segregation of intrastate and interstate gas.","start":800.01,"stop":818.934,"duration":18.92},{"text":"Now finally, let me just say a word about what's not in this case, although you might be told it is.","start":818.934,"stop":828.44,"duration":9.51},{"text":"And I'm referring now to so-called direct sales contracts where a producer sells to an industry or utility in a different state and the buyer picks up the gas.","start":828.44,"stop":846.207,"duration":17.77},{"text":"But because he can't use it in Texas or Louisiana, he transfers it to a pipeline and the pipeline, in turn, retransfers an equivalent amount of gas at the other end of the pipeline.","start":846.207,"stop":860.376,"duration":14.17},{"text":"Or transportation agreements as such whereby a shippers and if they gives a pipeline gas and the pipeline gives him an equivalent amount of gas at the other end of the pipeline.","start":860.376,"stop":875.167,"duration":14.79},{"text":"Now, the Commission in this very case may express that it was not holding those types of transactions jurisdictional, and it has never held either type of transaction jurisdictional.","start":875.167,"stop":891.074,"duration":15.91},{"text":"It does have and I would -- do not deny it, a proceeding pending before, at the present moment, undecided looking into the question of transportation agreements, because there are questions as to whether or not how they should be treated.","start":891.074,"stop":906.362,"duration":15.29},{"text":"But it hasn't done anything of this nature so far and contrary to what you may hear, a decision here does not necessarily decide those other questions.","start":906.362,"stop":918.129,"duration":11.77},{"text":"And the reason for that is very simple in my opinion.","start":918.129,"stop":922.021,"duration":3.89},{"text":"There's a separate serious question involved in calling direct sales or transportation agreements, sales for resale.","start":922.021,"stop":931.63,"duration":9.61},{"text":"And they are the question which has not been resolved as to whether there's any sales relationship involving the pipeline in those cases.","start":931.63,"stop":939.773,"duration":8.14},{"text":"If there is and maybe there are very well might be, but if there is, we might have this case.","start":939.773,"stop":944.526,"duration":4.75},{"text":"But whether there is or not, has never been determined.","start":944.526,"stop":963.76,"duration":19.23}]},{"speakerName":"Earl

the physical operation of this system if this deal has been consummated, if this deal is consummated, will be that both Lo-Vaca and Houston will insert their gas into this system at Three Rivers and this gas will flow west through a new plant, the Coquat Station where some of the gas will be utilized through the existing Sonora plant, on west, when it gets to this meeting point here about halfway through, it will split it into two other lines but those two lines will also go west and eventually those lines, both of them will go into first, New Mexico and then Arizona and then seem to join I
