tax on the life insurance company taxable income.","start":704.518,"stop":715.565,"duration":11.05},{"text":"And then 802 (b) defines life insurance company taxable income in such a way as to make the

taxable income.","start":732.891,"stop":740.064,"duration":7.17},{"text":"In some cases, taxable investment income is and in other cases, it isn't.","start":740.064,"stop":746.126,"duration":6.06},{"text":"Now, the same problem here essentially arises both in the case of gain from operations and the computation of taxable investment income.","start":746.126,"stop":759.165,"duration":13.04},{"text":"And in order to simplify the explanation, I'm going to confine myself to gain from operations.","start":759.165,"stop":770.484,"duration":11.32},{"text":"Section 809 on page 93 deals with the subject of gain from operations, it provides that the share of each and every item of investment yield including the tax-exempt interest, which is set aside for policyholders, shall not be included in the gain from operations.","start":770.484,"stop":800.261,"duration":29.78},{"text":"And you'll note that in the second sentence, it provides a formula stating how the share for policyholders shall be computed.","start":800.261,"stop":810.328,"duration":10.07},{"text":"And what it is in effect is a declaration that it will be the same percentage as the required annual addition to the policyholders' reserve, $800,000 in our example, bears to the total investment yield, a million in our example or 80%, so the policyholders' share is 80% of every item and the company share is 80% of every item.","start":810.328,"stop":842.591,"duration":32.26},{"text":"Then, in defining gain or loss from operations, the statute provides that it shall consist of the company's share of every item, the shares added together plus various items which are chiefly the underwriting income that we're not concerned with, less the deductions allowed in subdivision (d) over on page 94.","start":842.591,"stop":870.919,"duration":28.33},{"text":"The sub -- the deductions allowed under subdivision (d) on page 94 include the company's share of any tax-exempt income, specifically state bond interest and the intracorporate dividends to a percentage and so forth.","start":870.919,"stop":890.039,"duration":19.12},{"text":"So that in effect what happens is that the 20% of the state bond interest shown in the upper right hand corner of my chart, it is set aside as the company's share and is on any ratable allocation of the company's share is excluded from gain from operations so that it isn't taxed and the rest of it of course isn't taxed because it is treated as set off to the policyholders and that it -- full deduction is allowed for that amount.","start":890.039,"stop":922.578,"duration":32.54},{"text":"Now, there's one further point that I should emphasize.","start":922.578,"stop":927.762,"duration":5.18},{"text":"When the formula that I have just tried to describe and another formula that was the mathematical and legal equivalent were before the Congress, it was argued that the formulas imposed a tax on state bond

committees and by most of the proponents of this bill but there was an argument on the point.","start":951.037,"stop":960.689,"duration":9.65},{"text":"The -- there was also an argument on the second point which was what the Treasury was -- which was whether the Treasury was really trying not to say that this wasn't a tax on state bond interest but to overturn the whole doctrine that state bond interest is immune from tax as some of the earlier decisions on intergovernmental immunities had been overturned in the 1930s by this Court.","start":960.689,"stop":991.488,"duration":30.8},{"text":"The proponents of the bill agreed that it would be undesirable to overturn the basic doctrine apparently.","start":991.488,"stop":1001.065,"duration":9.58},{"text":"They denied that this was in a violation of the basic doctrine which the critics asserted the opposite.","start":1001.065,"stop":1008.818,"duration":7.75},{"text":"But the upshot was that there was written in to the statute an exception clause which appears on page 94 of our gain from
