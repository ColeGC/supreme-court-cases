simple.","start":47.903,"stop":52.866,"duration":4.96},{"text":"It involves a felony murder case from the State of Louisiana.","start":52.866,"stop":58.337,"duration":5.47},{"text":"The murder occurred during the commission of an armed robbery on October 7, 1960.","start":58.337,"stop":63.683,"duration":5.35},{"text":"The facts are that the accused below, Wayne Turner, arrived at Hammond, Louisiana, hungry and broke.","start":63.683,"stop":71.035,"duration":7.35},{"text":"During the armed robbery of a Phillips 66 Service Station, the attendant at the station drew a 38 caliber revolver from his pocket and began shooting.","start":71.035,"stop":82.887,"duration":11.85},{"text":"Turner shot back and of course the attendant was killed almost instantly.","start":82.887,"stop":89.164,"duration":6.28},{"text":"Turner and his wife both confessed to the murder the following day.","start":89.164,"stop":93.809,"duration":4.64},{"text":"Both were indicted.","start":93.809,"stop":95.478,"duration":1.67},{"text":"The wife was allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter and is now out on probation.","start":95.478,"stop":101.493,"duration":6.02},{"text":"The trial of Wayne Turner lasted three days in the 21st Judicial District Court of the Parish of Tangipahoa, State of Louisiana.","start":101.493,"stop":108.895,"duration":7.4},{"text":"This is the district or trial court in the state.","start":108.895,"stop":112.572,"duration":3.68},{"text":"During these three days, the petty jury consisting of 12 men was in the custody of among other deputies or bailiffs, Deputies Rispone and Chief Criminal Deputy Hulon Simmons.","start":112.572,"stop":126.284,"duration":13.71},{"text":"Now, Deputy Rispone and Deputy Simmons were both witnesses for the prosecution in the trial of this case.","start":126.284,"stop":132.784,"duration":6.5},{"text":"Deputy Rispone testified that he was the first to arrive at the scene of the crime, that he made the official investigation and report.","start":132.784,"stop":141.277,"duration":8.49},{"text":"He further testified that he heard Wayne Turner admit to having committed the crime.","start":141.277,"stop":147.634,"duration":6.36},{"text":"He further testified that Wayne Turner had led him to the site of certain incriminating evidence consisting of a murder weapon and certain identification cards belonging to Turner.","start":147.634,"stop":158.033,"duration":10.4},{"text":"Rispone also testified in connection with establishing the chain of evidence.","start":158.033,"stop":162.888,"duration":4.86},{"text":"Deputy Hulon Simmons testified that he had received the confession which was allegedly free and voluntarily given.","start":162.888,"stop":169.922,"duration":7.03},{"text":"This is a written confession.","start":169.922,"stop":172.483,"duration":2.56},{"text":"In addition, Deputy Simmons testified as to the chain of evidence and as to certain admissions made by Turner of his guilt.","start":172.483,"stop":180.172,"duration":7.69},{"text":"A motion for mistrial and the motion for a new trial were both overruled and this Court after an adverse decision from the State Supreme Court of Louisiana granted certiorari.","start":180.172,"stop":193.116,"duration":12.94},{"text":"Both the motion for mistrial and the motion for a new trial were based basically on the fact that these bailiffs are deputies or chief prosecution witnesses but not only that that during the course of this trial, these witnesses had mingled with, had fraternized with, had become a part of and identified with the petty jury.","start":193.116,"stop":215.66,"duration":22.54},{"text":"In other words that they had conducted themselves in such a way not to shield the jury from outside communication but had actually communicated unnecessarily and visited with the jury unnecessarily themselves.","start":215.66,"stop":229.95,"duration":14.29},{"text":"The basic issue before this Court is we believe one of constitutional importance and that is does the accused in a capital case especially in a capital case have a right to a trial by jury which is untainted with the suspicion of misconduct or must the accused go further and actually proved prejudice or misconduct that these things did happen that the fraternization did take place is on question.","start":229.95,"stop":264.651,"duration":34.7},{"text":"I might point out that the same type of conduct also occurred in another Louisiana case arising out of the same trial court which was tried only months before the Turner case was tried.","start":264.651,"stop":276.093,"duration":11.44},{"text":"That was the case of State versus McAlister which is cited in my brief.","start":276.093,"stop":282.431,"duration":6.34},{"text":"These things did happen.","start":282.431,"stop":284.709,"duration":2.28},{"text":"I believe that the Louisiana courts have failed to clearly distinguish between separation and seclusion and that this imparts the counts for the error that they've fallen into.","start":284.709,"stop":297.045,"duration":12.34},{"text":"Separation is defined on page 8 of respondent's brief is the physical separation of one juror from another.","start":297.045,"stop":305.922,"duration":8.88},{"text":"Seclusion, however, means simply to be cut off from outside communication.","start":305.922,"stop":311.259,"duration":5.34},{"text":"Now, the Louisiana statute in point is revised statutes 15:394 which is set forth in full in the brief.","start":311.259,"stop":319.832,"duration":8.57},{"text":"This statute used the words “keep together.”","start":319.832,"stop":323.911,"duration":4.08},{"text":"What could these words mean except that the jury is to be kept together not to be physically separated.","start":323.911,"stop":330.639,"duration":6.73},{"text":"The statute also uses the words “secluded from outside communication.”","start":330.639,"stop":336.852,"duration":6.21},{"text":"What could this possibly mean except that the jury is not to communicate unnecessarily with members or with anyone except its on members.","start":336.852,"stop":345.779,"duration":8.93}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"What was the extent of the fraternization that you've

the -- it consists of really three things.","start":349.768,"stop":359.091,"duration":9.32},{"text":"First of all, there was a separation of the jury on approximately nine occasions and three separate automobiles when they were taken to and returned from a restaurant.","start":359.091,"stop":369.754,"duration":10.66},{"text":"In addition, on of these occasions, one juror Mr. Paul Casanova was separated alone from the other jurors.","start":369.754,"stop":378.083,"duration":8.33},{"text":"In other words, it was an 11 to one separation.","start":378.083,"stop":381.199,"duration":3.12},{"text":"Mr. Casanova was in a company of deputies Simmons and Rispone on this occasion and in the company possibly of another unidentified deputy.","start":381.199,"stop":389.873,"duration":8.67},{"text":"At page 37 of the printed record, you will note that Deputy Simmons testified that while he was paying the check at the restaurant, Paul Casanova, the juror was alone with Deputy Rispone and/or some unidentified third person.","start":389.873,"stop":407.623,"duration":17.75},{"text":"We intend to show and I will develop it just a

arises.","start":407.623,"stop":420.614,"duration":12.99}]},{"speakerName":"Arthur J.

separation.","start":704.182,"stop":707.831,"duration":3.65},{"text":"There was no possibility that any of the jurors could have been contacted during the separation, therefore, the verdict was not set aside.","start":707.831,"stop":715.917,"duration":8.09},{"text":"In State versus Fuller, two jurors ate at the same table with an outsider in a

tried.","start":721.815,"stop":728.451,"duration":6.64},{"text":"The verdict was not set aside because the Court found positively that there was no prejudice.","start":728.451,"stop":734.29,"duration":5.84},{"text":"But even here, the presumption arose because there had been a separation.","start":734.29,"stop":739.638,"duration":5.35},{"text":"In State versus Davis and other Louisiana case, also cited by respondents, the jury was accorded in five rooms n a hotel

separation, because obviously, they were separated into five different rooms, the Court did not overturn the verdict because there had been no breach of the seclusion of the jury.","start":756.109,"stop":769.204,"duration":13.09},{"text":"The jury could not possibly have been contacted by an outside, a person or persons.","start":769.204,"stop":774.718,"duration":5.51},{"text":"It is interesting to note also in the Davis case that the deputy slept in a separate
