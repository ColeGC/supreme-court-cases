criticized the bill as being too restrictive.","start":1004.266,"stop":1015.305,"duration":11.04},{"text":"He pointed out that the Senate bill did not provide for referendum and quickly added that in his view that was an unintended omission.","start":1015.305,"stop":1028.615,"duration":13.31},{"text":"That in point of fact he thought and I think I'd quote him, “That the Congress was prepared to

referendum.","start":1126.475,"stop":1135.578,"duration":9.1},{"text":"All of them eliminated the regulation of a decrease in dues, and most significantly all of them granted President Meany's request
