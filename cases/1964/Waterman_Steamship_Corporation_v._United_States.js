9(c) 1. 9(c) 1 is quite explicit on that amounts credited to the Secretary under the Section 9(b) 6, that is for charter hire, shall be treated for Federal Tax purposes as not having been received but accrued as income.","start":435.805,"stop":474.5,"duration":38.69},{"text":"That alone however, still wouldn't have been enough because the applicant was taking depreciation deductions on these ships
