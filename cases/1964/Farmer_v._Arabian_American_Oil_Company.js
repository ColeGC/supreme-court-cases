judge.","start":569.234,"stop":573.897,"duration":4.66},{"text":"Before the second trial judge, the defendant argued that it should follow the previous determination of the first judge as a matter of comity and as a matter of orderly procedure but he declined to do so.","start":573.897,"stop":588.856,"duration":14.96},{"text":"An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals and we opposed the appeal on the ground, first that the appeal involved only the matter of costs and that the costs have been determined in the discretion of the court and that under these conditions, under the rule laid down by this Court that was not appealable.","start":588.856,"stop":617.227,"duration":28.37},{"text":"Now, I might say that in that appeal, the defendant did not urge that there had been an abuse of discretion nor did it urge that the failure to follow the first judge's determination was erroneous as a matter of law.","start":617.227,"stop":634.598,"duration":17.37},{"text":"It merely contended that the first judge's determination should have been followed.","start":634.598,"stop":641.202,"duration":6.6},{"text":"Following the argument and submission of that appeal, the appellate court apparently divided two to one in favor of affirmance, that is Judges Hayes and Smith voted for affirmance, and the Chief Judge voted for reversal.","start":641.202,"stop":658.998,"duration":17.8},{"text":"And they thought that the importance of the subject required that the entire court be convened en banc and that was done and the court in a five to four division voted to reverse.","start":658.998,"stop":674.885,"duration":15.89},{"text":"The Chief Judge, Judges Moore, Judge Friendly, Judge Kaufman and Judge Marshall voted with

own.","start":695.852,"stop":702.314,"duration":6.46},{"text":"Now I'll state Judge Waterman's position first.","start":702.314,"stop":705.887,"duration":3.57},{"text":"He believed that the determination should be affirmed, but unlike both the majority and the minority, he was of the opinion that the District Judge should be left with discretion to determine whether or not in a given case the exigencies of that particular case did not require that costs in a greater amount than those prescribed by the rule or those limited by the 100-mile limitation should not be granted.","start":705.887,"stop":738.951,"duration":33.06},{"text":"Now as to that, I should like to comment first that I feel that the right of access to the court is so vital and so important and that it is a right and not a privilege that it should not be left for the determination of some individual judge, in some circumstances we know nothing about, but which we can imagine from this very case as to whether a litigant would be permitted to litigate.","start":738.951,"stop":765.722,"duration":26.77},{"text":"We think he -- every litigant, every person and every citizen is entitled to litigate as a matter of right and not by reason of judicial favor.","start":765.722,"stop":776.47,"duration":10.75},{"text":"So, I get back to the majority view.","start":776.47,"stop":778.782,"duration":2.31},{"text":"The majority first commented on our contention that this was not appealable.","start":778.782,"stop":789.623,"duration":10.84},{"text":"And they said that they believed that since the enactment of these particular rules which gave the District Judge discretion as to whether or not costs should be taxed, the rule previously laid down by this Court to the effect that of judgments for costs alone where the question of discretion alone was involved was no longer valid.","start":789.623,"stop":817.356,"duration":27.73},{"text":"Well, what the majority overlooked was that the rule laid down by this Court was so laid down precisely because the District Judge had discretion.","start":817.356,"stop":828.197,"duration":10.84},{"text":"And they said that because the District Court had discretion, a judgment for costs alone was not appealable.","start":828.197,"stop":836.916,"duration":8.72},{"text":"However, that determination and this is the part of the answer that I feel I should've given Mr. Justice Goldberg yesterday.","start":836.916,"stop":846.25,"duration":9.33},{"text":"That determination isn't -- I'm afraid before this Court although I've included it as one of the questions, in the thought that if this Court wished to make any comment on the subject it would be in the record.","start":846.25,"stop":859.225,"duration":12.98},{"text":"It's not before the Court because that determination was not essential to the holding of the Court of Appeals.","start":859.225,"stop":866.426,"duration":7.2},{"text":"The Court of Appeals having put its granting of the right to appeal on a totally different ground namely that the failure of the second judge to follow the holding of the first judge was erroneous as a matter of law, and that it was that disregard of the law which gave the defendant the right to appeal.","start":866.426,"stop":889.389,"duration":22.96},{"text":"Therefore, the question as to whether a purely discretionary determination as to cost was appealable or not, or whether the rule laid down by this Court was or was not valid while they passed upon it, it was pure dicta so far as this determination was concerned.","start":889.389,"stop":906.408,"duration":17.02},{"text":"And it's for that reason Your Honor that I said yesterday that the determination of the Court of Appeals put the case in a different posture altogether.","start":906.408,"stop":916.164,"duration":9.76},{"text":"And I can't come here and say that they should never have been given the right to appeal because costs alone were involved, because the Court of Appeals said “Well, cost alone weren't involved.","start":916.164,"stop":927.683,"duration":11.52},{"text":"The requirement of law is that you must follow the decision of the first judge.”","start":927.683,"stop":933.828,"duration":6.14},{"text":"And having violated that rule of law there here is a matter of right.","start":933.828,"stop":940.322,"duration":6.49},{"text":"Now, I get to the point and this is where I should have answered Mr. Justice Goldberg's answer -- question in the affirmative.","start":940.322,"stop":949.462,"duration":9.14},{"text":"It's perfectly true that if this Court should hold that the Court of Appeals erred in determining that as a matter of law that a second judge was bound to follow the ruling of the first judge, there need be no further determination as to what we considered to be the main question of this appeal.","start":949.462,"stop":970.129,"duration":20.67},{"text":"And I was so obsessed, I must tell you, with the thought of the importance of this question that I merrily in my own mind disregarded the other.","start":970.129,"stop":980.018,"duration":9.89},{"text":"And I hope that this is a more satisfactory answer than the one I gave yesterday.","start":980.018,"stop":985.615,"duration":5.6},{"text":"Now, as to the question put by Mr. Justice Harlan, in the various decisions and there have been many and various decision with many and various reasons given as to why the 100-mile limitation should or should not be followed.","start":985.615,"stop":1005.163,"duration":19.55},{"text":"The one that seemed to me to make the most sense and the one that came closer to the heart and core of this whole matter was one in Michigan in 1888 by District Court Judge in the case of Vernan which is cited in one of the opinions in the Court of Appeals.","start":1005.163,"stop":1023.536,"duration":18.37},{"text":"And if I may just read that, it explains so exactly what my thought was.","start":1023.536,"stop":1028.833,"duration":5.3},{"text":"He said, “I see no reason why he” referring to the litigant, “might not procure the attendance of an important witness from California or even Australia or other remote quarter of the globe and practically ruin the opposite party by the accumulation of costs”.","start":1028.833,"stop":1047.808,"duration":18.97},{"text":"And it was for that reason that that particular court adhered to the 100-mile limitation.","start":1047.808,"stop":1053.825,"duration":6.02},{"text":"But I must say that none of these cases follow any routine or any pattern except the latter of the cases which have fallen into a pattern.","start":1053.825,"stop":1063.857,"duration":10.03},{"text":"And each of the cases which might be considered to have formulated the rule, all appear to me to have been decided on an ad hoc basis.","start":1063.857,"stop":1072.856,"duration":9},{"text":"It depended on the equities of the particular situation, and it was in that fashion that the rule evolved.","start":1072.856,"stop":1080.087,"duration":7.23},{"text":"And I have made no effort in our brief to improve upon the reasons given in the dissenting opinions below as to the justifications of the rule.","start":1080.087,"stop":1090.254,"duration":10.17},{"text":"First, it would be presumptuous and it would be supererogation and frankly, I myself see no logic in the rule.","start":1090.254,"stop":1097.876,"duration":7.62},{"text":"And to me it's more important that there is such rule than to find a reason for it any more than I would find a reason for the 100-mile limitation prescribed by this Court in admiralty.","start":1097.876,"stop":1111.239,"duration":13.36},{"text":"Now the point that I come to now deals with the requirement that in exercising his discretion under the rule as to whether to grant or withhold cost, a judge is bound to take into consideration the views expressed by another judge.","start":1111.239,"stop":1130.881,"duration":19.64},{"text":"It seems to me that in the very nature of a discretion conferred upon a judge, it's an impossibility to say to a judge, “You may exercise your discretion provided you give weight to views expressed by other judges”.","start":1130.881,"stop":1148.43,"duration":17.55},{"text":"Discretion isn't given by withholding it at the time that you're given it.","start":1148.43,"stop":1154.415,"duration":5.98},{"text":"Secondly, the reason that was given seemed to me not to be a very valid reason and the Court said with great concern for the sensitivity of the judge affected and for his views that they thought that it was not altogether proper to affront a judge by disregarding his views and having another judge come to a different conclusion.","start":1154.415,"stop":1185.232,"duration":30.82},{"text":"Well, it seems to me that by the time a judge has ascended the bench, he has become pretty well accustomed to contrariety of opinion.","start":1185.232,"stop":1194.648,"duration":9.42},{"text":"If he hasn't, by virtue of his practice and by virtue of his encounter with his adversaries in the courts, he has in many, many ways.","start":1194.648,"stop":1204.349,"duration":9.7},{"text":"And once he ascends the bench, he encounters contrariety of opinion from at least 50% of the lawyers who appear before him.","start":1204.349,"stop":1212.952,"duration":8.6},{"text":"True, he has the ascendancy but every time appellate court speaks, he is subjected to the trauma of contrariety of opinion.","start":1212.952,"stop":1223.865,"duration":10.91},{"text":"And if he happens to be a married man, and is fortunate in having teenage children, he encounters it at home every day of his life.","start":1223.865,"stop":1233.368,"duration":9.5},{"text":"And if I may borrow an expression of Samuel Johnson's in his essay on hope, and he said concerning Addison if contrariety could poison a politician, he would not live a single day.","start":1233.368,"stop":1250.089,"duration":16.72},{"text":"And so I say if contrariety could poison a judge, he would not live a single day.","start":1250.089,"stop":1255.486,"duration":5.4},{"text":"So to say that a judge may not exercise the discretion conferred upon him by law for fear of giving offense to another judge who is previously expressed an opinion just -- it doesn't conform to the realities of the situation and offers no justification for the denial of justice to the litigant who may be affected.","start":1255.486,"stop":1278.166,"duration":22.68},{"text":"And more important than that, the second judge in this particular case had the advantage in deciding whether to grant or withhold costs of having an expression by the Court of Appeals on the manner of trying this case in various other factors.","start":1278.166,"stop":1294.978,"duration":16.81},{"text":"And the discretion conferred by the statute should be given as the situation stands right up to the moment of the exercise of discretion and should not permit the dead hand of some prior determination made under other circumstances to control his conscience.","start":1294.978,"stop":1316.03,"duration":21.05},{"text":"So, I say that the rule isn't a good one.","start":1316.03,"stop":1319.106,"duration":3.08},{"text":"It could lead only to confusion.","start":1319.106,"stop":1321.831,"duration":2.72},{"text":"And in this particular case it shows the extent to which it can confuse when the Court of Appeals while holding that the second trial judge was bound to follow the first trial judge, held at the same time that a good portion of the first trial judge's determination was erroneous and it reversed that portion of it.","start":1321.831,"stop":1343.19,"duration":21.36},{"text":"So, I think Your Honors that this is a rule that's so important that so vitally affects litigants particularly those who don't have great means that clarification of the rule for the guidance of all of the circuits should be made.","start":1343.19,"stop":1361.499,"duration":18.31},{"text":"And I believe it should be made in the manner proposed by the minority below.","start":1361.499,"stop":1369.809,"duration":8.31},{"text":"Now, the next point that I come to is the point that we consider that -- I should like just to say about that that the controverted points that the Court of Appeals held was erroneous was that when application was made for re-taxation before the first judge, we pointed out that certain seats on the company owned planes had been unoccupied at the same time that these witnesses were brought in.","start":1369.809,"stop":1409.692,"duration":39.88},{"text":"And the court suspended his decision as to that portion of the costs and asked for proof under ought as to whether or not first it was company plane, secondly whether they were regularly run trips or whether they will run specially to accommodate these witnesses, and whether they would've been empty seats anyway of these -- to these persons had not occupied them.","start":1409.692,"stop":1435.445,"duration":25.75},{"text":"And when the proof was furnished by the defendants and it proved that these were regularly scheduled runs which would've run regardless that if these witnesses had not occupied them, those seats would have remained empty.","start":1435.445,"stop":1448.35,"duration":12.9},{"text":"To our great surprise he nevertheless made the award and held that because the defendants accounting procedures were perfectly correct and proper that he should make the allowance.","start":1448.35,"stop":1462.845,"duration":14.5},{"text":"Now, the second point that I come to and that we consider the really important point is the amount of costs that were taxed here and the great danger that would result to this country and to its citizens if some curb were not put upon the taxing of cost.","start":1462.845,"stop":1487.116,"duration":24.27},{"text":"We have said and the defendant has not controverted, that if the limitation were removed as proposed by the court below, the costs
