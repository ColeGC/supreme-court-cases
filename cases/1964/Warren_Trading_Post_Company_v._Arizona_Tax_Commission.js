question only of law, a question of first impression to this Court.","start":36.995,"stop":43.465,"duration":6.47},{"text":"The question is whether a state may impose a license prohibition and a privilege tax upon a federally licensed Indian trader for the privilege of his engaging and making retail sales from his trading post on the reservation to reservation Indians.","start":43.465,"stop":62.027,"duration":18.56},{"text":"By stipulation, there is excluded from this case any question of off reservation sales to Indians or

non-Indians.","start":70.738,"stop":78.608,"duration":7.87},{"text":"The case comes to you with undisputed facts yet the history surrounding these facts, I shall briefly give, because I think it's important to put the action of the Arizona State Tax Commission into context.","start":78.608,"stop":97.517,"duration":18.91},{"text":"Since 1876, the Congress of the United States has given to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs the sole power and authority to appoint traders to the Indian tribes and to make such rules and regulations as he may deem just and proper specifying the kind and quantity of goods and the prices at which such goods shall be sold to the Indians.","start":97.517,"stop":120.233,"duration":22.72},{"text":"The appellant in this case, the Warren Trading Post is such a federally licensed Indian trader.","start":120.233,"stop":126.298,"duration":6.06},{"text":"Its trading post is at Kayenta, Arizona that is on the Navajo Reservation.","start":126.298,"stop":132.887,"duration":6.59},{"text":"It is on the south border of Monument Valley.","start":132.887,"stop":136,"duration":3.11},{"text":"It is in Navajo County, Arizona and it rents its premises from the Navajo Tribe.","start":136,"stop":142.484,"duration":6.48},{"text":"Pursuant to this congressional action, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs has issued a number of rules governing many and we think most phases of Indian commerce.","start":142.484,"stop":153.816,"duration":11.33},{"text":"In the spring of 1935, the Arizona legislature passed a Privilege Tax Act not unlike that of Illinois and several other states levying a gross privilege tax measured by gross proceeds of sales on a variety of occupations including for our purposes the occupation of retailing.","start":153.816,"stop":173.479,"duration":19.66},{"text":"In 1940, the Assistant Solicitor wrote an official opinion for Mr. Oscar Chapman, the then Assistant Secretary of Interior with specific reference to the Arizona Privilege Tax stating that it should not apply to federally licensed Indian traders making sales to Indians on the reservation.","start":173.479,"stop":195.395,"duration":21.92},{"text":"That opinion was honored until the assessment made in this case in 1958.","start":195.395,"stop":202.181,"duration":6.79},{"text":"In 1958, the Arizona State Tax Commission under the privilege tax section which levies a tax on retailing.","start":202.181,"stop":210.959,"duration":8.78},{"text":"And pursuant to a rule which it had adopted two years earlier which said that this section shall apply also to Indian traders levied an assessment of $2800 odd dollars on the Warren Trading Post.","start":210.959,"stop":223.795,"duration":12.84},{"text":"This was the first time in the 23 years since 1935 when the Arizona Privilege Tax went into effect that anybody had tried to tax a licensed Indian trader on these kinds of sales not alone in Arizona but in the other 24 states which happen to have Indian reservations lying in whole or in part within their boundaries.","start":223.795,"stop":247.159,"duration":23.36},{"text":"Since that time, however, both the State of New Mexico and the State of California had taken similar positions.","start":247.159,"stop":253.476,"duration":6.32},{"text":"The State of New Mexico's case is now pending before their Supreme Court by stipulation to be determined in accordance with the opinion of Your Honors.","start":253.476,"stop":261.728,"duration":8.25},{"text":"The California position is reflected only in a recent opinion in 1958 of the California Attorney General, reversing a previous opinion to the contrary, his action also having been taken after the move made by Arizona.","start":261.728,"stop":276.839,"duration":15.11},{"text":"In October of 19 -- in August of 1958, my esteemed and deceased partner Perry Ling brought an action for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of Arizona.","start":276.839,"stop":288.305,"duration":11.47},{"text":"The Superior Court held against Warren and for the State Tax Commission, basing their opinion on Thomas versus Gay finding no difference between a tax on an Indian trader's stock in trade and a tax on his right to engage in commerce the one came under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the constitution and the other did not.","start":288.305,"stop":309.649,"duration":21.34},{"text":"The Arizona Supreme Court in December of 1963 sustained the superior court but on a slightly different ground.","start":309.649,"stop":316.728,"duration":7.08},{"text":"It found that so long as a law was neither in consistent with or burdensome to federal purposes, it could operate coexistent with federal law and found as a fact this tax to be neither inconsistent with or burdensome to federal purposes.","start":316.728,"stop":333.354,"duration":16.63},{"text":"There was a long dissent filed by now Chief Justice Warren (Inaudible) one of our court adopting the view of the appellant Warren Trading Post and on October 12 of 1964, this Court noted probable jurisdiction.","start":333.354,"stop":346.366,"duration":13.01},{"text":"Our case rests on three points.","start":346.366,"stop":349.414,"duration":3.05},{"text":"We believe anyone of which independent of the other should sustain the position that the Arizona Supreme Court should be reversed and that these kinds of sale should go tax free.","start":349.414,"stop":363.322,"duration":13.91},{"text":"Very briefly, the three points of these, first, we believe that the national character of Indian commerce like the National Character of Interstate in Foreign Commerce is such that were there no federal regulations whatever the field should be left clear for federal regulation at such time as it should choose to occupy it.","start":363.322,"stop":387.617,"duration":24.3},{"text":"Second, that as a matter a fact, the field of Indian commerce has been heavily occupied with both congressional action and rules adopted by the Commission of Indian -- Commissioner of Indian Affairs pursuant thereto so that there is no room left for state action that would not be contradictory thereto.","start":387.617,"stop":408.248,"duration":20.63},{"text":"Finally, that there resides in the Indian tribes a degree of sovereignty as this Court announced in Williams versus Lee, a degree of internal sovereignty which can be impinged upon by the states only upon specific authorization of the Congress.","start":408.248,"stop":429.801,"duration":21.55},{"text":"We believe any of the three points sufficient to justify our position.","start":429.801,"stop":434.802,"duration":5},{"text":"Going back to the first one every briefly, we believe that the National Character of Indian Commerce is equal to the National Character or greater than that involved in interstate and even perhaps foreign.","start":434.802,"stop":448.257,"duration":13.45},{"text":"In the decision of Dick versus The United States written by Mr. Justice Harlan, this Court took much the same position although not related to a privilege tax but related to Indian commerce.","start":448.257,"stop":459.319,"duration":11.06},{"text":"We believe the reason for the National Character of Indian Commerce relates to its purposes and goals highly related to the purposes and goals of the other two fields namely the economic development of the Indians as set forth by this Court in Williams versus Lee, the congressional legislation points to making the tribes both self reliant and economically self-sufficient.","start":459.319,"stop":484.376,"duration":25.06},{"text":"We think this is the sort of thing that can best be done and perhaps only be done by the Federal Government.","start":484.376,"stop":490.34,"duration":5.96},{"text":"We believe the geography of the situation alone is an argument in this favor.","start":490.34,"stop":496.239,"duration":5.9},{"text":"For example, the Navajo Reservation with which we happen to be concerned today stretches across three states, Arizona, New Mexico and the Southern part of Utah.","start":496.239,"stop":505.592,"duration":9.35},{"text":"Not given to the independent regulation we would think of the 25 separate states which contain all or part of an Indian Reservation.","start":505.592,"stop":516.336,"duration":10.74},{"text":"The occupation of the field we believe to be so great that even if the first premise were denied and we present these arguments both alternately but at the same time believing in all three as an independent basis.","start":516.336,"stop":532.644,"duration":16.31},{"text":"We believe the occupation of the field so substantial that there is no room for state regulation.","start":532.644,"stop":539.903,"duration":7.26},{"text":"In this Court's decision, the Pennsylvania versus Nelson, you've set down several rules for determining whether a field had been federally occupied in its totality.","start":539.903,"stop":551.339,"duration":11.44},{"text":"The last of these rules I think is interesting in view of a recent advent on the Papago Reservation.","start":551.339,"stop":557.553,"duration":6.21},{"text":"The last of the rules is with the enforcement of state laws present a serious danger of conflict with the administration of federal justice.","start":557.553,"stop":567.613,"duration":10.06}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Jacobson you may have told us but if so, I missed

Overlap)?","start":569.718,"stop":580.456,"duration":10.74}]},{"speakerName":"Edward Jacobson","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Justice Stewart, the one point of law upon which both parties are aggrieved is that sales to individuals on the United States versus Holiday, individual Indians constitutes Indian commerce.","start":580.456,"stop":593.43,"duration":12.97},{"text":"The sales from the Warren Trading Post are to individual Indians where they may have made some sales to tribes, the case does not rest on tribal (Voice Overlap)
