conduct operations in that State that are proportional to the State's population.","start":18.009,"stop":38.755,"duration":20.75},{"text":"The better reading of the statute, in our view, is that it

headquarters.","start":402.83,"stop":408.151,"duration":5.32},{"text":"And the dictionary definitions that we identified in -- in our brief and every Federal and State law that defines the term

situations.","start":433.818,"stop":440.789,"duration":6.97},{"text":"Now, by and large, the headquarters is relatively straightforward.","start":440.789,"stop":443.757,"duration":2.97},{"text":"It's made in public filings which are an easy place to look, and if you look at the experience of the Seventh Circuit, which of course has applied the headquarters approach across the board over the course of several decades, I think we can see that that test has been straightforward and it is simple in application, in the main.","start":443.757,"stop":457.167,"duration":13.41},{"text":"Now, that is not to say that there are not issues about the definition of headquarters at the outer perimeters.","start":457.167,"stop":460.953,"duration":3.79},{"text":"There are.","start":460.953,"stop":461.503,"duration":0.55},{"text":"And I think the place I would look first and foremost is: Where does direction and control for the corporation come from?","start":461.503,"stop":466.873,"duration":5.37},{"text":"That is the situs at which the headquarters would be found.","start":466.873,"stop":469.392,"duration":2.52},{"text":"And I would look also to what a corporation itself identifies as headquarters in public filings.","start":469.392,"stop":474.628,"duration":5.24},{"text":"In 10-K filings and under the Model Business Corporations Act, corporations have to report their headquarters in annual reports.","start":474.628,"stop":481.032,"duration":6.4},{"text":"And of course they are doing those reports for other reasons other than establishing jurisdiction in a particular case, so I think they come with an air of objectivity about them.","start":481.032,"stop":488.436,"duration":7.4},{"text":"That's where I would look.","start":488.436,"stop":489.472,"duration":1.04},{"text":"Now, I would make this other point, though, about the ambiguity that Your Honor points to with respect to the definition of a headquarters.","start":489.472,"stop":495.626,"duration":6.15},{"text":"That -- that is not at all an ambiguity that only applies to our test, because under Respondent's test and under the test of every court of appeals, they take into account the headquarters.","start":495.626,"stop":504.915,"duration":9.29},{"text":"Now, we would think that that is dispositive.","start":504.915,"stop":507.767,"duration":2.85},{"text":"The other courts consider it at least highly relevant, albeit not

could pick the headquarters.","start":516.622,"stop":520.49,"duration":3.87},{"text":"You'd say Congress wanted one place; headquarters is a logical choice, end of -- but most circuits have made it more complicated than that.","start":520.49,"stop":530.929,"duration":10.44},{"text":"The Seventh Circuit is the only one who said, keep it simple, as you urge -- headquarters.","start":530.929,"stop":536.416,"duration":5.49},{"text":"Why are the other circuits resistant to the solution that you are

first court to consider this question was the Third Circuit in the Scott case, pretty soon after the statute was enacted in 1958.","start":553.877,"stop":566.602,"duration":12.73},{"text":"And that court, with respect, didn't wrestle with the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms, and it didn't wrestle with the strong premium on simple and administrable jurisdictional rules.","start":566.602,"stop":576.141,"duration":9.54},{"text":"And then that doctrine sort of took on a life of its own, I

of 1958 was that it was a model.","start":622.188,"stop":627.425,"duration":5.24},{"text":"Now, since then, the Collier's treatise, for example, would tell you that the majority and predominant rule is the headquarters rule, even in the bankruptcy context.","start":627.425,"stop":634.013,"duration":6.59},{"text":"Pre-1958, I think there was a

brief.","start":636.531,"stop":638.983,"duration":2.45},{"text":"But there certainly were some courts that adopted a headquarters approach, even in the bankruptcy context.","start":638.983,"stop":642.869,"duration":3.89},{"text":"But I think one thing I would caution the Court about is assuming that just because some courts in the bankruptcy context, because of bankruptcy-specific considerations -- and a specific consideration was the felt need to have the assets of the bankrupt estate within the purview of the court so that the court could administer the estate -- that Congress would have wanted to import every judicial application down to every nuanced detail in the bankruptcy context over to the jurisdictional context, where we know that Congress thought that simplicity was a real virtue.","start":642.869,"stop":670.419,"duration":27.55},{"text":"And I think, as Your Honor's opinion in Wachovia v.

context.","start":670.419,"stop":682.41,"duration":11.99},{"text":"And here, because of the strong preference -- excuse me -- in favor of simplicity and administrability in jurisdictional rules, that

that the majority rule now is that the principal place of business would be New Jersey.","start":718,"stop":732.827,"duration":14.83},{"text":"And one point I would like to get to in that regard is the sort of oddity of saying that the -- the principal place of business of a company like Hertz would be somewhere other than New Jersey.","start":732.827,"stop":741.599,"duration":8.77},{"text":"The Ninth Circuit has a view that the principal place of business of Hertz is California, based on the fact that Hertz conducts 20 percent of its business in California.","start":741.599,"stop":749.038,"duration":7.44},{"text":"But it is important to bear in mind that this statute is a zero-sum game.","start":749.038,"stop":751.99,"duration":2.95},{"text":"So that if Hertz is deemed to have its principal place of business in California, such that it is disabled from getting access to diversity jurisdiction in California, the consequence is that Hertz would be enabled to gain diversity jurisdiction in every other State -- and I'm putting to one side Delaware, the State of incorporation -- but it would be enabled to gain access to -- to diversity jurisdiction in every other State.","start":751.99,"stop":771.987,"duration":20},{"text":"So the consequence would be that if Hertz were sued in a State court action in Park Ridge, New Jersey, the site of its headquarters, Hertz could get Federal court jurisdiction in that jurisdiction on the theory that it's an out-of-State
