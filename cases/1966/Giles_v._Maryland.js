other.","start":111.302,"stop":120.426,"duration":9.12},{"text":"The testimony is in conflict as to what caused the altercation and who provoked it and for present purposes, I'd not go into that.","start":120.426,"stop":131.125,"duration":10.7},{"text":"But very early in the altercation, at the time when James Giles and Johnson threw some stones at the car, Joyce ran out of the car and into the woods along the side of the dark road.","start":131.125,"stop":147.932,"duration":16.81},{"text":"According to her testimony, she ran a distance of 30 feet at which point she stopped because

some conversation.","start":173.568,"stop":182.692,"duration":9.12},{"text":"Joyce herself testified that she was the first person to introduce the subject of sex.","start":182.692,"stop":190.15,"duration":7.46},{"text":"In that she offered John Giles to have intercourse with him if he would help her get away.","start":190.15,"stop":200.131,"duration":9.98},{"text":"John Giles also testified to that offer.","start":200.131,"stop":203.837,"duration":3.71},{"text":"But he gave it a little more body, he testified that she also explained to him that she was on probation and couldn't afford to get caught in the woods and didn't want to get in any trouble and for that reason she was anxious that he help her get away.","start":203.837,"stop":223.482,"duration":19.65},{"text":"After they have been quietly in the woods together for a while.","start":223.482,"stop":228.21,"duration":4.73},{"text":"The

came into the woods along the same path and they came upon John Giles and Joyce.","start":234.526,"stop":246.792,"duration":12.27},{"text":"At this point, there's a very serious cleavage in the testimony.","start":246.792,"stop":251.108,"duration":4.32},{"text":"Joyce testified that the three men were there and that each one of the three they're after having intercourse with her.","start":251.108,"stop":263.499,"duration":12.39},{"text":"She testified that she did not resist, she testified that she made no outcry, she also testified that she made no remonstrance.","start":263.499,"stop":272.356,"duration":8.86},{"text":"She didn't even say to them, “Please let me alone.”","start":272.356,"stop":275.698,"duration":3.34},{"text":"She also took off her own clothes.","start":275.698,"stop":277.501,"duration":1.8},{"text":"This was her own testimony.","start":277.501,"stop":279.132,"duration":1.63},{"text":"She said she submitted this way because she was frightened.","start":279.132,"stop":284.292,"duration":5.16},{"text":"The Giles brothers testified that as the two who had been delayed came along the path, Joyce called them over saying to John, “Well I know what you boys want.”","start":284.292,"stop":298.792,"duration":14.5},{"text":"Then she called them over and said, “I know what you boys like” and then urged them to have intercourse with her.","start":298.792,"stop":305.442,"duration":6.65},{"text":"She took off her own clothes, she was the stage master of the affair.","start":305.442,"stop":310.064,"duration":4.62},{"text":"She directed the order of intercourse.","start":310.064,"stop":312.837,"duration":2.77},{"text":"And then the course of this transaction, she told them that she had had 16 or 17 other boys that week and two or three more wouldn't make any difference.","start":312.837,"stop":325.088,"duration":12.25},{"text":"She told James

examination by the state, Joyce was asked if she was in fact on probation at the time of this episode.","start":355.162,"stop":366.754,"duration":11.59},{"text":"She denied that she was on probation

three.","start":455.007,"stop":478.386,"duration":23.38},{"text":"They denied it and the only listed to help defense, the whole thing was a factless maneuver because Joyce had already admitted that

conflict between credibility.","start":493.229,"stop":497.729,"duration":4.5},{"text":"This all white jury had to decide whether to believe this 16-year old white girl or these two young Negroes.","start":497.729,"stop":506.762,"duration":9.03},{"text":"And the story that these two young Negroes gave was the most implausible story.","start":506.762,"stop":511.508,"duration":4.75},{"text":"It was that under these rather frightening conditions, the 16-year old child solicited intercourse with three Negro strangers.","start":511.508,"stop":521.49,"duration":9.98},{"text":"For the jury to believe their story, they would have to find that this 16-year old child was incredibly wanted that she was probably mentally disturbed and there was no evidence of either condition.","start":521.49,"stop":534.399,"duration":12.91},{"text":"They would also have to believe that this girl who was not on probation went around intuitively telling people that she was on probation.","start":534.399,"stop":543.357,"duration":8.96},{"text":"The jury found them guilty and their story didn't impress the trial judge, Judge Pugh, very much either because although under Maryland law, he had a choice of sentence from 18 months they day he imposed to that sentence.","start":543.357,"stop":561.36,"duration":18},{"text":"These two brothers were at that time aged 20 and 22.","start":561.36,"stop":566.427,"duration":5.07},{"text":"Joseph Johnson didn't feel any better in this trial at Minneapolis.","start":566.427,"stop":571.917,"duration":5.49},{"text":"After the appeals were exhausted on November 16, 1962, 11 months after the verdict, a new trial motion was filed on behalf of the petitioners alleging the newly discovered evidence.","start":571.917,"stop":590.379,"duration":18.46},{"text":"The circuit court denied this motion without even looking at the newly discovered evidence on the ground that the motion was filed too late.","start":590.379,"stop":600.386,"duration":10.01},{"text":"They said under Maryland rules if you want to file a motion for a new trial on the base of newly discovered evidence you have to file within three days after verdict.","start":600.386,"stop":610.644,"duration":10.26},{"text":"This ruling was affirmed by the Maryland Court of Appeals.","start":610.644,"stop":617.347,"duration":6.7},{"text":"Subsequently, in October of 1963, Governor Tawes commuted the death sentences of the three men, that is, for two petitioners and Johnson to life.","start":617.347,"stop":629.305,"duration":11.96},{"text":"This post conviction proceeding was filed about six months after that in May of 1964.","start":629.305,"stop":637.012,"duration":7.71},{"text":"It was heard in the circuit court of Montgomery County though before a different judge than the sentencing judge.","start":637.012,"stop":643.604,"duration":6.59},{"text":"And after an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court found that the petitioners had been denied due process by reason of the fact that the prosecution had suppressed material exculpatory evidence.","start":643.604,"stop":662.969,"duration":19.37},{"text":"The state appeal and the Court of Appeals reversed -- the Court of Appeals heard the case en banc and they reversed five to two.","start":662.969,"stop":673.023,"duration":10.05},{"text":"And that then we came here.","start":673.023,"stop":675.082,"duration":2.06},{"text":"Before I get into a discussion of the evidence which came out at the post conviction trial and a description of the evidence that we claim was suppressed, I would like to mention a couple of the legal issues that are involved.","start":675.082,"stop":690.173,"duration":15.09},{"text":"The legal issues in the suppression point all arise out of one sentence.","start":690.173,"stop":695.809,"duration":5.64},{"text":"They all arise within the framework of one sentence over the Court's decision, 1963 decision in Brady against Maryland.","start":695.809,"stop":705.188,"duration":9.38},{"text":"And in that case, the court said and I quote, “We now hold that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”","start":705.188,"stop":733.521,"duration":28.33},{"text":"Now, in that case, the qualification of on request is explainable by the fact that in that case, the evidence which had been withheld had been requested.","start":733.521,"stop":746.508,"duration":12.99},{"text":"In fact, none of the lower courts which have passed on suppression cases have ever made a requirement that the defense had to request the information before the nondisclosure could be excused.","start":746.508,"stop":766.098,"duration":19.59},{"text":"And this is true of cases which were decided before Brady including two Third Circuit cases which Brady cited with approval of stating the correct rule and two of cases cited after Brady and it was true in this very case.","start":766.098,"stop":781.948,"duration":15.85},{"text":"In this very case, the Maryland Court of Appeals did not require a showing of a request for disclosure and it is perfectly obvious that the -- if you -- a requirement of a request would defeat the rule because the time when a defense needs disclosure the most, is when the defense is so ignorant and so uninformed that it doesn't know what to request or even whether to request.","start":781.948,"stop":810.109,"duration":28.16},{"text":"So for the future purposes, I shall assume that the Brady rule applies without the need for a request for the exposure abiding the facts.","start":810.109,"stop":823.592,"duration":13.48},{"text":"That brings me to the second requirement of the Brady case and that is that the withheld evidence be material.","start":823.592,"stop":833.838,"duration":10.25},{"text":"And Brady didn't explain the meaning of the test of materiality.","start":833.838,"stop":840.931,"duration":7.09},{"text":"The Maryland Court of Appeals didn't explain it either but if you analyze what they did, it is perfectly clear that they held that evidence is immaterial unless it were so strong that as to be full through.","start":840.931,"stop":856.774,"duration":15.84},{"text":"If there was any possibility that it might not have affected the result then it wasn't material.","start":856.774,"stop":862.9,"duration":6.13},{"text":"Now, it seems to us that the analogy here should be to the test of materiality which this Court develop in cases like the Napue case where the fault was the introduction of testimony known to the prosecution to be incorrect and the failure of the prosecution to correct the incorrect testimony.","start":862.9,"stop":888.896,"duration":26},{"text":"And the tests stated by this Court in the Napue case was that the evidence, the wrongful -- the admitted evidence, was material and tainted the conviction if the false testimony, “May have had an effect on the outcome of the trial” and the Court has applied the same tests to cases where evidence where illegally obtained evidence and violation of the Fourth Amendment was admitted.","start":888.896,"stop":922.045,"duration":33.15},{"text":"So in they against Connecticut, the test was whether the admission of the evidence -- there was a reasonable possibility that the admission of the evidence might have affected the result.","start":922.045,"stop":935.426,"duration":13.38},{"text":"Now, this kind of case is a corollary case to the use of false evidence and it seems to us clear that the same test of materiality should apply namely if the evidence if the evidence have been revealed, was there a reasonable possibility that it would have affected the result.","start":935.426,"stop":957.963,"duration":22.54},{"text":"In our view, this test of materiality was more than that.","start":957.963,"stop":962.818,"duration":4.86},{"text":"And now I come to our description of the evidence that we claim was suppressed and which was brought out at the post-conviction proceeding.","start":962.818,"stop":972.136,"duration":9.32},{"text":"The evidence falls under two categories.","start":972.136,"stop":975.598,"duration":3.46},{"text":"The first category is evidence of the events between the episode the alleged rape of July 20, 1961 and the trial in December 1961.","start":975.598,"stop":988.761,"duration":13.16},{"text":"The evidence shows this, on the 9th of August 26, 1961, one month after the alleged rape, three months before the trial, Joyce went to a party, and at the party she had intercourse with two men; one in the bathroom, one in the yard.","start":988.761,"stop":1011.557,"duration":22.8},{"text":"Early the next morning, she took an overdose of drugs and a suicide attempt and she was taken to a hospital and was kept in the hospital in the psychiatric ward of the hospital for 10 days with admitting diagnosis of a psychopathic personality.","start":1011.557,"stop":1034.042,"duration":22.48},{"text":"While she was in the psychopathic ward of the hospital she was visited by a boyfriend of hers named Busty.","start":1034.042,"stop":1042.075,"duration":8.03},{"text":"Busty asked her why did she attempt suicide.","start":1042.075,"stop":1047.656,"duration":5.58},{"text":"She told Busty that she had been raped the night before the suicide attempt by these two men that whom she had had intercourse at the park, and she gave him the names of the men and all the detail.","start":1047.656,"stop":1061.232,"duration":13.58},{"text":"Busty reported this rather officiously because she didn't ask him though.","start":1061.232,"stop":1067.79,"duration":6.56},{"text":"Busty reported this to her parents.","start":1067.79,"stop":1072.311,"duration":4.52},{"text":"Her mother first called sergeant way up in Montgomery County police who was in-charged of the investigation resulting in the conviction of petitioners.","start":1072.311,"stop":1083.026,"duration":10.72},{"text":"And she told Sergeant Whalen that Joyce had been raped again.","start":1083.026,"stop":1087.133,"duration":4.11},{"text":"So Whalen asked her where did this take place and she said in Prince George's County.","start":1087.133,"stop":1091.682,"duration":4.55},{"text":"So Whalen said well don't bother me, tell it to the Prince George's County police and presumably he went back to sleep.","start":1091.682,"stop":1099.224,"duration":7.54},{"text":"So she or her husband reported it to the Prince George's County police.","start":1099.224,"stop":1104.9,"duration":5.68},{"text":"Detective Sergeant Wheeler of the Prince George's County Police came to the hospital to interview Joyce in connection with this complaint.","start":1104.9,"stop":1116.852,"duration":11.95},{"text":"When he interviewed her, the first thing she told them was that these two men at the party had had relations with her against her will.","start":1116.852,"stop":1126.614,"duration":9.76},{"text":"But he then questioned her further.","start":1126.614,"stop":1129.261,"duration":2.65},{"text":"In the course of the questioning it became perfectly apparent that she had not been raped, that she engaged in voluntary intercourse, she had put up no resistance and that the most she had was an unexpressed mental reservation.","start":1129.261,"stop":1146.449,"duration":17.19},{"text":"She really didn't want to engage an intercourse with these two boys at that time.","start":1146.449,"stop":1151.385,"duration":4.94},{"text":"She said at that particular time because she was afraid that if all the other boys at the party got to know about it, they would all
