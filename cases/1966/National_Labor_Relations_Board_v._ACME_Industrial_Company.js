so-called subcontracting clause.","start":162.27,"stop":175.641,"duration":13.37},{"text":"Under this clause in relevant part, the company agreed not to subcontract work which is normally performed by employees in the bargaining unit where this will cause the layoff of employees or prevent the recall of employees who would normally perform this work for the company.","start":175.641,"stop":203.068,"duration":27.43},{"text":"The second clause is the so-called work transfer clause which is Article 6, Section (10) set forth at page 102 of the record and

company.","start":203.068,"stop":231.628,"duration":28.56},{"text":"Employees working in the Laflin Street plant were subject to layoff or reduction and classification as a result of this transfer but

out that the arbitrator's authority is limited to the interpretation of the terms of this agreement which ties in with the way the grievance is defined which I pointed out earlier as being a

procedure.","start":348.221,"stop":372.575,"duration":24.35},{"text":"Now, in January of 1964 some months after this contract was executed, the union discovered that machinery was being moved from the
