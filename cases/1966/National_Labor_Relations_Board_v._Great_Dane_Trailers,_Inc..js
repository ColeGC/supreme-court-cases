1st.","start":347.352,"stop":351.376,"duration":4.02}]},{"speakerName":"Arnold Ordman","textObjs":[{"text":"Not exactly because under the agreement itself, for example, people who had been quit or

not?","start":363.533,"stop":365.034,"duration":1.5}]},{"speakerName":"Arnold Ordman","textObjs":[{"text":"That's correct.","start":365.034,"stop":368.318,"duration":3.28},{"text":"Now, the company -- their company suggested that this matter might be resolved at the bargaining table, which is also in the record an indication they suggest that this might be resolved by an independent lawsuit under the contract.","start":368.318,"stop":381.044,"duration":12.73},{"text":"Now, needless to have at this point, there weren't any bargaining negotiations so far as the record shows on this issue but -- and I think it is a matter of law and not in dispute that the employees couldn't be forced to bargain away any contract rights or statutory rights which they have or which had accrued.","start":381.044,"stop":399.961,"duration":18.92},{"text":"Now, shortly thereafter, in August -- and this was in July -- in August, the company did make vacation payments to all the nonstrikers and to those strikers, who had abandoned the strike before July 1st, and had not been -- and had not been replaced but the returning strikers even those who returned who were replaced and those who elected to continue to exercise their statutory right to strike, received no vacation pay even though under the -- during the existence of the contract their right to vacation pay had accrued.","start":399.961,"stop":434.751,"duration":34.79},{"text":"Now, the company defended its action before the Board on the ground that the payments were made, that the payments that were made were made not under the contract which has been terminated but under a unilateral policy which it said that it adopted following the termination of the contract but it concedes, and these are its own words, that the unilateral policy incorporated substantially the same conditions as to the contract.","start":434.751,"stop":460.239,"duration":25.49},{"text":"Now, as for its refusal to make payments to those who continued on strike and to replace strikers, it simply explained that, well there was a break in the length of service and the employees who weren't -- didn't get paid were not working as of July 1st and the strikers who were replaced weren't employees at all.","start":460.239,"stop":479.317,"duration":19.08},{"text":"Now, the Board found that by denying this vacation pay, the strikers who would not abandon the strike or had been replaced, the company discriminated against them because of their adherence to the strike, their continued exercise of the right to strike.","start":479.317,"stop":494.188,"duration":14.87},{"text":"Now, whether the company made its selection of who got paid and who didn't get paid, pursuant to the contract provisions or pursuant to its unilateral policy which have formulated after the contract terminated, the Board said this was really immaterial.","start":494.188,"stop":510.252,"duration":16.06},{"text":"They're not under the Board's holding, it stated, was that under the law, strikers have to be treated uniformly with nonstrikers with the relation to whatever benefits accrued to them from their employment relationship.","start":510.252,"stop":526.342,"duration":16.09},{"text":"In this connection, incidentally, the Board did order that the strikers be awarded back pay but it specifically excluded any compu -- that computation of the back pay due them anytime in which they were not working and which they were on strike.","start":526.342,"stop":541.313,"duration":14.97},{"text":"The Board incidentally also agreed and this is agreed that there wasn't any independent subjective evidence of disparity of treat -- of intent to penalize strikers.","start":541.313,"stop":551.491,"duration":10.18},{"text":"Now, the court below disagreed with the Court.","start":551.491,"stop":554.674,"duration":3.18},{"text":"Before the court below, we urged the Erie Resistor principle and the court below made no mention of Erie Resistor.","start":554.674,"stop":560.932,"duration":6.26},{"text":"Instead, it cited the more recent decision of this Court in the American Ship Building case and it said that the American Ship Building case stands for the proposition that if the employers conduct carries with it any other inference, any other inference of a legitimate motive, the inference of illegality which would otherwise bring does not control.","start":560.932,"stop":588.514,"duration":27.58},{"text":"Now, the Court recognized that the record in the case before it, did not disclose any such legitimate motive and I take it that means that it rejected the reasons the company gave it before the Board.","start":588.514,"stop":599.957,"duration":11.44},{"text":"It said the record doesn't disclose any legitimate motive but the court below itself suggested legitimate motives which might have motivated the employer.","start":599.957,"stop":610.329,"duration":10.37},{"text":"For example, it suggested that may be the company did what it did to reduce expenses.","start":610.329,"stop":617.046,"duration":6.72},{"text":"Maybe it did it to encourage longer tenure among the present employees or may be it did it to discourage early leave before vacation periods and because the court below said because these motivations may have existed and the court below concluded that the Board was required to and failed to establish of the company's action were prompted by some independent motive to penalize the strikers and the court denied the petition for enforcement.","start":617.046,"stop":648.137,"duration":31.09},{"text":"Now, there is some subordinate matters to which I think are adequately covered in the brief.","start":648.137,"stop":652.696,"duration":4.56},{"text":"I'd like to reach what I think is the overriding issue, whether the interpretation put by the court below on the American Ship decision and its apparent rejection of -- we think its apparent rejection of the Erie Resistor principles applied to the fact of this case.","start":652.696,"stop":670.974,"duration":18.28},{"text":"Now, we think the Court of Appeals here as an Erie Resistor, erred in holding that in the absence of a finding of a specific illegal intent, a legitimate business purpose is always a defense to an unfair labor practice charge.","start":670.974,"stop":688.992,"duration":18.02},{"text":"Now, the court below doesn't, this Court does not and we do not again say the relevance and the importance and even then the necessity in 8 (a) (3) cases of showing an employer's intent or motive to discriminate or to interfere with union rights.","start":688.992,"stop":710.001,"duration":21.01},{"text":"But as Radio Officers has established, specific evidence of such subjective intent is in Justice Reed's language not an indispensable element of proof of violation.","start":710.001,"stop":723.675,"duration":13.67},{"text":"Now, such evidence is required, of course, in the typical situation.","start":723.675,"stop":728.206,"duration":4.53},{"text":"Take the normal discharge case which still is a large portion of the National Labor Relations Board work.","start":728.206,"stop":736.194,"duration":7.99},{"text":"There, many otherwise innocent or even ambiguous actions which are normally incident of the conduct of -- an employer's conduct of his business are exempt from the Act's stretches, unless specific intent of -- specific evidence of a subjective intent to discriminate or encourage or discourage union activity as shown.","start":736.194,"stop":758.566,"duration":22.37},{"text":"Now, this requirement is imposed because there's nothing in the nature of a conduct itself in the normal discharge case; there's nothing in the conduct itself which necessarily and foreseeably evinces a discriminatory purpose or effect of which is inconsistent with the employer's normal operation of his business.","start":758.566,"stop":780.955,"duration":22.39},{"text":"But we suggest that this category of cases has to be distinguished from the much smaller category and this Court has done so from the last frequent type of case typified by Radio Officers, by Erie Resistor and we believe this case, where the necessary foundation of discriminatory intent derives from what this Court has called the “inherently discriminatory” or destructive nature of the conduct itself.","start":780.955,"stop":810.59,"duration":29.63}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
