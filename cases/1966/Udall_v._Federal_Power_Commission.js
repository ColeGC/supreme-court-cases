1955, the Federal Power Commission gave notice of our application for a preliminary permit.","start":41.201,"stop":49.037,"duration":7.84},{"text":"And the question that Mr. Ely raises is what at that

clear.","start":52.314,"stop":61.289,"duration":8.98},{"text":"It did not mean that we were going to build the project described in that notice because as Mr. Solomon explained to you at some length yesterday and as I've commented, this is the one thing you do know, and that experience is shown that everybody involved in this particular activity knows that it is so unlikely that anything is going to come up, its exactly what's describe.","start":61.289,"stop":84.659,"duration":23.37},{"text":"Anyone reading that notice knew that whatever else it might mean it did not mean that that was the

purpose.","start":93.418,"stop":99.9,"duration":6.48},{"text":"And that is that there had been set in motion this statutory process which would eventuate in a project best adapted to a comprehensive plan within the standards of Section 10 (a).","start":99.9,"stop":114.021,"duration":14.12},{"text":"And, that consequently anyone who had purposes or plans or ambitions that would be affected by that

the expirations to develop the particular project.","start":114.021,"stop":140.612,"duration":26.59},{"text":"Now, viewed in light of this statutory purpose, I think that it is clear that the scope that the Commission has given to a preliminary permit is a very sensible and workable rule.","start":140.612,"stop":158.666,"duration":18.05},{"text":"Because what the Commission has said in this case

the same head.","start":158.666,"stop":180.964,"duration":22.3},{"text":"Now the phrase is substantially the same, are concepts that are very familiar to lawyers, something that violate is not an

see.","start":227.024,"stop":229.383,"duration":2.36},{"text":"It's a very easy thing, the nature of the resource automatically tells anybody that this is what is about to happen.","start":229.383,"stop":238.023,"duration":8.64},{"text":"Now, of course Mr. Ely argues this isn't what the notice was.","start":238.023,"stop":243.228,"duration":5.21},{"text":"That all it

relied upon that notice to his injury.","start":252.485,"stop":280.957,"duration":28.47},{"text":"Now, it's quite evident that as far as the particular petitioner in this case is concerned, no one of

right to assert notice.","start":318.937,"stop":322.43,"duration":3.49},{"text":"But let us even pass that by for the moment and assume that the supply system can stand on the shoes of either what
