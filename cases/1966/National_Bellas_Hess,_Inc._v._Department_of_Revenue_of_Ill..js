Cox","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.","start":12.302,"stop":15.821,"duration":3.52},{"text":"This appeal from the Supreme Court of Illinois presents the question whether Illinois constitutionally require an out-of-state mail order seller to collect the used tax which Illinois levies upon its residents subsequent use of goods purchased at retail, where the out-of-state seller has neither a place of business nor property nor salesman nor any other kind of representative within the jurisdiction.","start":15.821,"stop":47.578,"duration":31.76},{"text":"The facts are very simple.","start":47.578,"stop":49.49,"duration":1.91},{"text":"Appellant is a mail order house with its only offices and warehouse in Kansas City, Missouri.","start":49.49,"stop":55.944,"duration":6.45},{"text":"Twice a year it sends out through the mail would-be purchasers in Illinois and elsewhere, catalogues seeking purchasers for its goods.","start":55.944,"stop":67.275,"duration":11.33},{"text":"Now the catalogues are simply deposited in the mail, other fliers which were small sales book are sent out occasionally through the year.","start":67.275,"stop":77.02,"duration":9.74},{"text":"The would-be purchasers write in to the Kansas City office where their orders are accepted or rejected.","start":77.02,"stop":83.895,"duration":6.88},{"text":"The orders which are accepted are delivered usually to the United States mails in Kansas City, but occasionally to a common carrier like the American Railway Express and they are thus delivered to the purchasers in all of the states.","start":83.895,"stop":100.462,"duration":16.57}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"Just a matter of interest what kinds of merchandise do they

goods.","start":103.672,"stop":111.597,"duration":7.92},{"text":"Illinois since 1955 has levied a use tax upon costumer's use of goods purchased at retail.","start":111.597,"stop":123.819,"duration":12.22},{"text":"And it requires retailers maintaining a place of business in Illinois to collect the tax.","start":123.819,"stop":131.548,"duration":7.73},{"text":"Originally, Illinois gave a customary meaning to retailers maintaining a place of business in Illinois, but in 1961 it added the artificial definition whose constitutionality is an issue in this case.","start":131.548,"stop":148.833,"duration":17.28},{"text":"The provision appears on page 2 of our brief.","start":148.833,"stop":152.268,"duration":3.44},{"text":"It provides that retailer maintaining a place of business in this state shall include engaging and soliciting orders within this state from users by means of catalogues or other advertisings.","start":152.268,"stop":166.543,"duration":14.28},{"text":"In effect therefore, what Illinois is asserting is the right to impose upon an out-of-state seller the duty to collect the tax even so it is never been within the jurisdiction and does nothing more than send advertising through the mail.","start":166.543,"stop":182.881,"duration":16.34},{"text":"Of course that provision alone couldn't possibly be enforced by usual methods of collection.","start":182.881,"stop":189.275,"duration":6.39},{"text":"So having created one fiction, Illinois had to create another fiction.","start":189.275,"stop":193.569,"duration":4.29},{"text":"It provided that those who were deemed to be doing -- maintaining a place of business in Illinois, when they weren't, should also be deemed to consent to the Secretary of State being their agent for the service process, when in fact of course they had given no such incent.","start":193.569,"stop":212.033,"duration":18.46},{"text":"I don't suggest that the artificiality of those provisions in any way makes them unconstitutional.","start":212.033,"stop":218.388,"duration":6.36},{"text":"Illinois can say its black and it's white if it wishes, but I do submit that the artificiality of the definition shouldn't obscure what Illinois is actually doing.","start":218.388,"stop":230.774,"duration":12.39},{"text":"Relying on the statute in question, Illinois first assessed Texas beginning with the effective date of the amendment against the appellant, and then later brought suit by service upon the Secretary of State.","start":230.774,"stop":245.292,"duration":14.52},{"text":"We entered a special appearance and preserved our rights throughout the litigation.","start":245.292,"stop":250.704,"duration":5.41},{"text":"The trial judge granted the appellant's motions for summary judgment and the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed.","start":250.704,"stop":258.704,"duration":8},{"text":"It stated the case in our judgment entirely fairly and finding that we had no property, no representatives, no place of business, no nothing if I may put it that way in Illinois, it said nevertheless the regular sending of advertising through the mails was enough to permit Illinois to impose these extra territorial obligations.","start":258.704,"stop":284.399,"duration":25.69},{"text":"There are two other facts which I must emphasize.","start":284.399,"stop":289.372,"duration":4.97},{"text":"One of them was stated by a special subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee that it made an exhaustive, much the most exhaustive study in state taxation of interstate commerce, and which emphasized that it must be brought in mind that efforts to subject mail are to sales, to sales taxation involve not only the major houses, but also a large number of much smaller businesses.","start":289.372,"stop":315.769,"duration":26.4},{"text":"We're not talking here about Sears and Montgomery Ward.","start":315.769,"stop":319.68,"duration":3.91},{"text":"They have retail outlets in almost every jurisdiction and therefore it clearly subject to their power.","start":319.68,"stop":327.268,"duration":7.59},{"text":"We're talking about firms like the appellant which is

legislation.","start":345.759,"stop":350.75,"duration":4.99},{"text":"My neighbor who used to have a mail order business in Massachusetts, he had five employees during most of the year.","start":350.75,"stop":356.998,"duration":6.25},{"text":"It grows up to 20 in the pre-Christmas season.","start":356.998,"stop":359.653,"duration":2.66}]},{"speakerName":"Abe

Justice.","start":368.606,"stop":369.36,"duration":0.75}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"I'm sorry.","start":369.36,"stop":371.259,"duration":1.9},{"text":"As I understand it, this case does possibly in a way involve a distinction between sporadic and limited mailings and a regular course of periodic mailings plus occasional mailings, but here --","start":371.259,"stop":389.938,"duration":18.68}]},{"speakerName":"Archibald Cox","textObjs":[{"text":"Here, our regular mailings were twice a year, and then there were smaller sales books.","start":389.938,"stop":395.507,"duration":5.57},{"text":"I think that's customary with nearly all mail ordered businesses.","start":395.507,"stop":399.257,"duration":3.75},{"text":"Of course some of them appear weekly in the New York Times, we all see them.","start":399.257,"stop":402.911,"duration":3.65}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"For example that I suppose this case would might be different from situation in which a department store, let's say, in New York City sells by mail to some extent, X-extent whatever it may be, to costumers in New Jersey or Connecticut or the district.","start":402.911,"stop":428.22,"duration":25.31}]},{"speakerName":"Archibald Cox","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, but I would think when -- when one can do the kind of advertising that many department stores do such as Masons of the Harvard Cooperative Society, where they send out sometimes in the newspaper regular advertising once a week or oftener that that was in substance indistinguishable from this case, as we think the regularity of the advertising in Miller and Maryland was indistinguishable from this case.","start":428.22,"stop":453.609,"duration":25.39},{"text":"Now the second fact that I wanted to emphasize in particular is that if Illinois can impose this obligation, so can every other sales or use tax state.","start":453.609,"stop":466.93,"duration":13.32},{"text":"We're not talking here about an obligation running to a single state.","start":466.93,"stop":471.224,"duration":4.29},{"text":"We're talking about whether a mail order business of moderate size or smaller size which regularly sends out its catalogues two or three times a year, merely because it puts its catalogues in the mail for national consumer market, can be required to collect used taxes for 10, 20 perhaps as many as 40 or 42 today, sales to the used tax states.","start":471.224,"stop":496.311,"duration":25.09}]},{"speakerName":"William J.

common?","start":499.19,"stop":500.584,"duration":1.39}]},{"speakerName":"Archibald Cox","textObjs":[{"text":"There are 17 states which now have legislation of this kind on the books.","start":500.584,"stop":506.558,"duration":5.97},{"text":"It may have gone up slightly, but 17 is the figure that sticks in my mind.","start":506.558,"stop":510.803,"duration":4.25},{"text":"There is almost no state which in fact takes steps to enforce it today.","start":510.803,"stop":516.659,"duration":5.86},{"text":"Most of the state sales tax administrators testified before this special committee I referred to, that they didn't think they had the power to impose this kind of legislation.","start":516.659,"stop":527.439,"duration":10.78},{"text":"But it's on the books.","start":527.439,"stop":528.604,"duration":1.17},{"text":"There is not slightly -- slightest doubt that it would be enforced if this case were to be affirmed.","start":528.604,"stop":536.965,"duration":8.36},{"text":"We submit that the statute is unconstitutional and that the judgment below should be reversed, because it violates both the due process and interstate commerce clauses of the federal constitution.","start":536.965,"stop":552.598,"duration":15.63},{"text":"Our first point is that the decision below is contrary to the governing precedence in this Court.","start":552.598,"stop":560.765,"duration":8.17},{"text":"The issue as the Chief Justice pointed out in the American Oil case a few terms ago, is one of nexus.","start":560.765,"stop":567.762,"duration":7},{"text":"Is -- there's some definite connection between the state and the person on whom it seeks to lay the burden?","start":567.762,"stop":575.923,"duration":8.16},{"text":"Now when you read the cases you will find that they draw a very sharp line of distinction.","start":575.923,"stop":582.606,"duration":6.68},{"text":"When the foreign corporation has their place of business, a retail outlet or salesman or solicitors of any kind within the state, then the Court has sustained jurisdiction to require seller collection.","start":582.606,"stop":599.398,"duration":16.79},{"text":"But where there is only regular advertising, and just as regular as in this case, plus delivery across state line the Court has held that there was no jurisdiction to impose seller collection.","start":599.398,"stop":612.05,"duration":12.65},{"text":"There are two cases that I would call attention to particularly, because they seem to me to come very close to the point and one of them plainly draws the very line on which we rely.","start":612.05,"stop":624.829,"duration":12.78},{"text":"I refer first to Nelson against Sears, Roebuck.","start":624.829,"stop":628.816,"duration":3.99},{"text":"There the court sustained Iowa's jurisdiction to require Sears to collect the used tax on mail order sales, but it didn't because Sears had retail outlets doing a local business in Iowa.","start":628.816,"stop":647.933,"duration":19.12},{"text":"The opinion is very clear on this point.","start":647.933,"stop":650.433,"duration":2.5},{"text":"Justice Douglas referred to the fact that Sears had those stores and then said that since Iowa has extended to it, that is Sears, that privilege of having the retail stores, Iowa can exact this burden as a price of enjoying the full benefits flowing from its Iowa business, and of course we don't have any such stores or any other kind of local business.","start":650.433,"stop":675.239,"duration":24.81},{"text":"Then he went on to advert to the situation of the mail order seller that has no retail stores and said very explicitly “Unlike respondent, they are not receiving benefits from Iowa for which it has power to exact price.”","start":675.239,"stop":692.728,"duration":17.49},{"text":"And that line drawn in that case is the very one on which we stand here.","start":692.728,"stop":699.403,"duration":6.68},{"text":"The second case to which I would -- which I would particularly emp --","start":699.403,"stop":702.461,"duration":3.06}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"General, may I ask you about that case?","start":702.461,"stop":705.852,"duration":3.39},{"text":"Does Sears collect this tax in other states than Iowa where it does not have any stores?","start":705.852,"stop":716.045,"duration":10.19}]},{"speakerName":"Archibald Cox","textObjs":[{"text":"I don't -- the -- as far as I know the situation is the one found by the special House Committee that collection of sales and used taxes is virtually unknown, those are the Committee's words.","start":716.045,"stop":729.709,"duration":13.66},{"text":"In states where a seller does only a mail order business of the practice right across the board has been to adhere to the distinction which I submit derives properly from the Sears case.","start":729.709,"stop":743.372,"duration":13.66},{"text":"Now the second case that seems to us to be controlling in principle was Miller and Maryland.","start":743.372,"stop":750.56,"duration":7.19},{"text":"There, Miller was a furniture store located in Wilmington and therefore necessarily fairly near the Maryland line.","start":750.56,"stop":758.516,"duration":7.96},{"text":"It set out advertising, regular advertising, four times a year to address the costumers in Maryland as well as in Delaware of course, and it advertised daily, Mr. Justice Fortas, in Wilmington papers circulating in Maryland.","start":758.516,"stop":774.679,"duration":16.16},{"text":"Costumers came to the store normally to select their merchandise, but the merchandise was delivered by Miller's trucks driven by Miller's employees.","start":774.679,"stop":785.946,"duration":11.27},{"text":"The court held nevertheless that there was no jurisdiction.","start":785.946,"stop":789.719,"duration":3.77},{"text":"Now we say if continuous regular advertising plus delivery with your own trucks is not enough to make jurisdiction, but then surely where you don't make delivery with your own truck take away that point of contact and the advertising alone cannot be a sufficient jurisdiction.","start":789.719,"stop":808.645,"duration":18.93},{"text":"It was just --","start":808.645,"stop":809.547,"duration":0.9}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"To

clauses in a way are two ways of getting it the same thing and that's why we rely on both.","start":823.547,"stop":830.265,"duration":6.72},{"text":"But it was essentially in terms of jurisdiction.","start":830.265,"stop":834.559,"duration":4.29},{"text":"Now the Miller case, I'd like to emphasize several things about it, but most particularly that our position here is entirely consistent with the position taken by the four dissenting Justices in Miller, because they rely very heavily on the regular deliveries in Miller's truck.","start":834.559,"stop":853.373,"duration":18.81},{"text":"And of course we do know such thing.","start":853.373,"stop":855.095,"duration":1.72},{"text":"We put nearly all our goods in the post office in Kansas City.","start":855.095,"stop":858.946,"duration":3.85},{"text":"We do make some deliveries to the railway express agency in Kansas City, but we don't have anybody using the Illinois highway or making household deliveries.","start":858.946,"stop":869.744,"duration":10.8},{"text":"In this connection, it'll take just a moment.","start":869.744,"stop":872.016,"duration":2.27},{"text":"It's interesting to know that the bill introduced at the last session by the House Judiciary Committee was only once in.","start":872.016,"stop":881.867,"duration":9.85},{"text":"It cuts back jurisdiction in the cases of people who have solicitors to those who have a business location in the state, but that doesn't matter here.","start":881.867,"stop":892.435,"duration":10.57},{"text":"It preserves the existing rule with respect to mail order sales, but we deem to be the existing rule.","start":892.435,"stop":898.652,"duration":6.22},{"text":"And it adopts in the case of household deliveries the position taken by the dissenters in Miller and
