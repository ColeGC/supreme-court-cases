of Arizona and the issue is the validity of a regulation of the State Land Commissioner of Arizona, Mr. Obed Lassen, my client here which requires that certain lands granted in trust to the State of Arizona by the federal government should be paid for if they are to be taken for the uses which I am going to discuss.","start":34.616,"stop":73.648,"duration":39.03},{"text":"The background of the matter is that we are interpreting an Act of Congress passed in the year 1910.","start":73.648,"stop":82.565,"duration":8.92},{"text":"At that time, there was pending the proposal to admit the 47th and 48th states, New Mexico and Arizona and an Enabling Act was about to be passed.","start":82.565,"stop":97.249,"duration":14.68},{"text":"The legislation was to contain as in the typical acts for the admission of new states provisions to provide public lands essentially and primarily for schools.","start":97.249,"stop":110.676,"duration":13.43},{"text":"In this case, it was contemplated that there would be ten and a half million acres of land given to the State of Arizona and a similar amount to the State of New Mexico to be held in trust for this purpose.","start":110.676,"stop":127.902,"duration":17.23},{"text":"But there had been a background in what was then the territory of New Mexico which disturbed the Congress very much.","start":127.902,"stop":137.564,"duration":9.66},{"text":"There had been what were known as the Tall Timber cases in which the practice had a reason of despoiling public lands in New Mexico by the devise of purporting to sell lands, having them stripped off their mineral or timber to assets and then giving them back to the state again and so as against this background in this Act, the Congress wished to be particularly careful and so it was and it provided not only as had been the tradition in other acts that the proceeds of public lands should be held in trust.","start":137.564,"stop":178.105,"duration":40.54},{"text":"The Congress also provided in this joint act for the two states that the very lands themselves should be held in trust and it provided further that those lands could never be disposed of except by the devise of public auction and that they never could they be disposed of except after an appraisal which would determine the true value thereof.","start":178.105,"stop":204.97,"duration":26.87},{"text":"There was a minimum offset price of so and so many dollars in paper but beyond that it was provided that the land should not be sold or leased I quote the statute in a whole or in part except to the highest and best bidder.","start":204.97,"stop":221.37,"duration":16.4},{"text":"And if was further provided in this section and I think is of special importance that all lands, leaseholds, timber and other products should be appraised of their true value and no sale or no other disposal thereof should be made for a consideration less than the value so ascertained.","start":221.37,"stop":242.51,"duration":21.14},{"text":"Under that statute then the lands were given to the two states and the practical experience has been that they have been frugally handled to the great benefit of education in both of these states.","start":242.51,"stop":256.192,"duration":13.68},{"text":"In New Mexico, which has a keen interest here

Mexico.","start":256.192,"stop":268.611,"duration":12.42},{"text":"In New Mexico something in the amount of 40% of the educational funds of the state have been developed from these lands and some $200 million has been held in trust.","start":268.611,"stop":281.005,"duration":12.39},{"text":"In our own state we have taken a more conservative approach to the use of the lands of the lands and we still have nine and a half million of the ten and a half million acres in the trust and the proceeds of the remainder are held in a permanent school fund and are used for the purposes of developing education in Arizona.","start":281.005,"stop":303.898,"duration":22.89},{"text":"These lands as enormous ten million acre track I must make clear is scattered throughout the state.","start":303.898,"stop":309.768,"duration":5.87},{"text":"We're not talking about a sector or part of a reservation.","start":309.768,"stop":312.547,"duration":2.78},{"text":"It's rather a

used for highways and for transportation or for some such purpose and I will explain in a moment why I used that broad term.","start":398.922,"stop":406.904,"duration":7.98},{"text":"They must be paid for and when the lands are taken for example to put in a road or a utility line or something of this sort, do the provisions of the trust law which provided all of the lands without exception shall be paid for in the minimum value do they apply or is there some reason for making an exception and not making a charge for those purposes.","start":406.904,"stop":427.545,"duration":20.64},{"text":"What has happened in our own state is I think a product of the peculiar road building background there.","start":427.545,"stop":435.743,"duration":8.2},{"text":"We are in a state which is one has developed relatively recently and in the earlier periods, local and county roads consisted as some of you has seen there a little more than running out of a drag device across the desert than sending a car long after.","start":435.743,"stop":452.734,"duration":16.99},{"text":"There were decisions in our state and only in our state with an exception I shall mention in the 40s holding that those did not need to be paid for under the Enabling Act.","start":452.734,"stop":464.299,"duration":11.56},{"text":"The situation has no radically changed because the roads become gigantic boulevard in interstate highways and we're talking about enormous quantities of land.","start":464.299,"stop":474.337,"duration":10.04},{"text":"And in these circumstances, the land commissioner of Arizona who is the trustee, Mr. Lassen, issued a regulation and this regulation provided that lands to be taken for highway purposes should be appraised and could be made available for this purpose but only at their true value after appraisal.","start":474.337,"stop":499.028,"duration":24.69},{"text":"Now, at that point, the highway department of the state instituted this action.","start":499.028,"stop":505.512,"duration":6.48},{"text":"And this action is a suit in the nature under our practice of a written provision brought by the highway department against the land department to prohibit it from enforcing that regulation.","start":505.512,"stop":519.785,"duration":14.27},{"text":"The matter was presented to our Supreme Court below, and the problem that was presented there is also a problem here that the attorney general is in the sense in both sides because he represents both state agencies.","start":519.785,"stop":532.732,"duration":12.95},{"text":"This is perfectly appropriate under our practice.","start":532.732,"stop":535.789,"duration":3.06},{"text":"It is I'm surely highly undesirable under yours.","start":535.789,"stop":539.627,"duration":3.84},{"text":"So that what happened there was is a practical matter that the representation of the highway department was placed on the hands of the firm which represents a major utility.","start":539.627,"stop":553.227,"duration":13.6},{"text":"A reclamation utility which wishes I am sure to follow along and put its lines in without thing for them to.","start":553.227,"stop":561.436,"duration":8.21},{"text":"The utility appeared in support of the highway department amicus in the trial court.","start":561.436,"stop":567.599,"duration":6.16},{"text":"Meanwhile the teachers of the state have the deepest possible interest in the future of the education and of educational lands and I was retained especially by the teachers for the purpose of filing an amicus brief there and have been denominated a wholly nominal assistant -- special assistant attorney general but in fact representative of the educational interest in the state to bring the matter here.","start":567.599,"stop":593.864,"duration":26.26},{"text":"Now, I pause with those details to make clear that I think we meet the standard of genuine adversary proceedings and it is adversary indeed but I felt that you should know what the background circumstances of the representation ought.","start":593.864,"stop":609.484,"duration":15.62},{"text":"The matter as they say came before our state Supreme Court and the state court in a lengthy opinion held that regardless of the trust language the lands need not need to be paid for and thus prohibited the use of the land department's regulation we brought them out of here.","start":609.484,"stop":627.212,"duration":17.73},{"text":"Now, what is it that is the decision or the essence of the decision of the court below?","start":627.212,"stop":633.195,"duration":5.98},{"text":"What it comes to is this.","start":633.195,"stop":638.63,"duration":5.43},{"text":"Well, it's a lengthy opinion it can boil down to only a couple of sentences and those are set forth and I'll simply mention them because you'll then have in the nutshell exactly what the decision was in the controversy is.","start":638.63,"stop":654.016,"duration":15.39},{"text":"The court below said that these lands need not be paid for and that the Enabling Act and that these provisions which I have read here need not be observed.","start":654.016,"stop":661.441,"duration":7.43},{"text":"First, because and I quote \"the respective right of way for these highways takes less than a fee estate\".","start":661.441,"stop":672.511,"duration":11.07},{"text":"In other words, they said, this is only taking an easement and when you take an easement you don't have to pay for it.","start":672.511,"stop":679.269,"duration":6.76},{"text":"Second, the court below said the trust and its beneficiaries the school lands are not deprived of anything of value.","start":679.269,"stop":693.418,"duration":14.15},{"text":"It is well known that good highways throughout the state increase the value of the lands.","start":693.418,"stop":701.222,"duration":7.8},{"text":"In other words, the court below reached its results under two grounds, (a) that this is a taking of an easement and that therefore that's free and you don't have to pay for it.","start":701.222,"stop":710.085,"duration":8.86},{"text":"And on the ground (b) that the school --","start":710.085,"stop":713.167,"duration":3.08}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Is that true that as a general matter under your state law?","start":713.167,"stop":715.668,"duration":2.5}]},{"speakerName":"John P. Frank","textObjs":[{"text":"No, far from it Your Honor.","start":715.668,"stop":717.171,"duration":1.5},{"text":"It is not only natural but let me direct myself to that because nobody seriously supports that position of our Supreme Court here.","start":717.171,"stop":723.909,"duration":6.74},{"text":"The Government has not said a word in behalf of us and neither has the other side.","start":723.909,"stop":728.091,"duration":4.18},{"text":"Now, in the first place Your Honor, while it may be true or not that taking an easement is that the taking of roads for our purposes is a matter of taking an easement.","start":728.091,"stop":740.686,"duration":12.6},{"text":"This is immaterial and frankly non-rational for two reasons.","start":740.686,"stop":744.295,"duration":3.61},{"text":"First, clearly from every practical standpoint only in interstate highway across the land of the State of Arizona with tons of concrete on the ground is in every functional sense identical to taking a fee that makes any difference.","start":744.295,"stop":757.819,"duration":13.52},{"text":"But secondly and the reason why this becomes immaterial and I shall not mention it again and I am sure you'll hear no more of it from the other side, is that the statute clearly is the -- I am speaking of the Enabling Act.","start":757.819,"stop":771.722,"duration":13.9},{"text":"The Enabling Act isn't restricted to the taking of fee interest.","start":771.722,"stop":775.948,"duration":4.23},{"text":"The Enabling Act says that there must be payment in full at the appraised value for the -- for any, it uses that broad term for any disposition of the lands and on top of that it nails it down Your Honor by saying that there must be taking in full for the use of the lands so that regarding the easement as regarding this as an easement if it is and it clearly from the functional standpoint would be almost absurd the use of property concepts but regarding at as such it doesn't make any difference because the statute says that whether you take this position any disposition what you take the use of is immaterial.","start":775.948,"stop":818.769,"duration":42.82},{"text":"So the matter comes to the remaining elements of the case and that remaining element of the case what the court below has said here in essence that it had -- I mean to judge you by it but it is similar to the -- what's good for General Motors is good for the country approach.","start":818.769,"stop":839.48,"duration":20.71},{"text":"What the court below is saying is roads are good for the state, what's good for the state is good for the school lands.","start":839.48,"stop":848.062,"duration":8.58},{"text":"This will increase the value of the school lands; therefore you don't need to pay for it.","start":848.062,"stop":852.95,"duration":4.89},{"text":"What's for the general good is sufficient and there need not be dollars in hand paid, that's the essence of the decision below and it's the essence of what has been the peculiar Arizona position on this subject.","start":852.95,"stop":866.054,"duration":13.1},{"text":"Now, in the first place Your Honor, allow to devote myself to that subject for the balance of my argument.","start":866.054,"stop":873.772,"duration":7.72},{"text":"We begin number one with the language of the statute itself.","start":873.772,"stop":880.784,"duration":7.01},{"text":"We begin with the fact that the statute expressly in the clearest possible way says that lands are to be paid for.","start":880.784,"stop":890.777,"duration":9.99},{"text":"It does not permit of the so-called doctrine of enhancement.","start":890.777,"stop":896.753,"duration":5.98},{"text":"It doesn't say that the land shall be valued and that there should be credited against the value whatever plus that there may be thought become as a result of the taking but nothing like that is in this law at all.","start":896.753,"stop":910.719,"duration":13.97},{"text":"Instead it does in the most expressed possible way put certain statutory minimum and then in the most exact possible way says that there should be an appraisal and there should be no sale of any lands or disposition of any lands, any taking for any use of any land except of that level of value.","start":910.719,"stop":929.049,"duration":18.33},{"text":"Now, I have begun by saying that this was a statute which have had very close congressional attention particularly because of the background of land scandals against which it was passed.","start":929.049,"stop":941.274,"duration":12.23},{"text":"And this is so Your Honors, they -- we have set forth a good deal of the legislative histories in our briefs and I won't give you more than the flavor of it here.","start":941.274,"stop":951.517,"duration":10.24},{"text":"But I wish to note that these particular restrictions were added in their final forum by the Senate Committee after full hearings and that the report show great emphasis on what the statute says so that the Senate Report says that these lands shall be held in trust to be disposed of only as therein provided and the question was expressly considered before one of the congressional committees are these restrictions too heavy?","start":951.517,"stop":982.506,"duration":30.99},{"text":"Are they severe, can you live with these?","start":982.506,"stop":984.402,"duration":1.9},{"text":"It is alright?","start":984.402,"stop":985.862,"duration":1.46},{"text":"And the representative of Arizona appearing before the committee, appearing in behalf of the territory in asking for statehood said that when asked about these careful restrictions based on the lands and I am quoting from the question he said I believe the restrictions on such public lands cannot be made too broad.","start":985.862,"stop":1008.051,"duration":22.19},{"text":"In other words, the territory in asking for statehood was welcoming the very kind of provisions which in fact were put into this law and the report of the interior department shows that in -- as a result of the very investigation that have been made of land frauds, these provisions saying you can only take it this way, you can only price it this way had been put in.","start":1008.051,"stop":1036.608,"duration":28.56},{"text":"The final report of the Senate Committee began and I give you this as indication of the tremendous earnestness of which the committee approach the problem began your committee cannot too earnestly call attention to the extreme care that should be taken with every provision of a bill like this and I go on to tell that but they were particularly meticulous in a matter of this kind and this matter of legislation.","start":1036.608,"stop":1068.554,"duration":31.95},{"text":"Now, what has happened since?","start":1068.554,"stop":1070.941,"duration":2.39},{"text":"We have had not merely a legislative history of great care.","start":1070.941,"stop":1075.434,"duration":4.49},{"text":"We have had a subsequent congressional development of great care in dealing with this Act.","start":1075.434,"stop":1081.276,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Because this Act is of course subject to amendment and the point is that whenever it has been proposed that there be any deviation from these careful pricing terms or from the careful disposition terms the interested parties have gone back to Congress and presented the matter and they have gotten an amendment if Congress wanted to give it and because this trust was accepted by the State of Arizona and is part of our Constitution, this may require an amendment to our state constitution as well.","start":1081.276,"stop":1115.277,"duration":34},{"text":"But to give one illustration just a single illustration which will dramatize it I think.","start":1115.277,"stop":1119.928,"duration":4.65},{"text":"We have a little village in our state called the town of Benson and the town of Benson is so small that it was unable when it wanted a section of land just that small amount for a public park to pay the $3.50 an acre amount which would be needed even for that 600 acres.","start":1119.928,"stop":1140.759,"duration":20.83},{"text":"They simply couldn't afford it.","start":1140.759,"stop":1141.928,"duration":1.17},{"text":"We are talking about a very small town.","start":1141.928,"stop":1145.55,"duration":3.62},{"text":"And therefore, an amendment was passed through the Congress which expressly authorized the giving of a section of land, a single section to the town of Benson without compensation and the legislative history expressly shows that this was done because there was no way of dedicating that one section for a public use except by paying for it other than by this amendment of the Act.","start":1145.55,"stop":1178.271,"duration":32.72},{"text":"Now, Your Honors, I have no doubt and I am sure no one did then when the sincere truly sincere people who passed that act passed it but they felt that the giving of this section to Benson would improve the value of the town of Benson and improve values of the land around it and doubtlessly the giving of that section would do something for the general values of all of the rest of the school line of the region or the state or whatever but the point is that it was not supposed that the piddling amount of $2000.00 worth of land could be disposed of without compensation except by an Act of Congress and yet under the Arizona decision and practice from which we appeal, $9 million worth of land have been taken from this school trust funds already and are irretrievably gone --","start":1178.271,"stop":1233.044,"duration":54.77}]},{"speakerName":"Abe
