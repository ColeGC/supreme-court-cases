Chicago.","start":97.477,"stop":107.892,"duration":10.41},{"text":"It frequently happens that a passenger engaged on a through journey through Chicago must transfer from his incoming to his outgoing

petitioner.","start":129.723,"stop":140.158,"duration":10.43},{"text":"Prior to 1955, this interstation transfer service had been performed for many years by the Parmelee Transportation Company.","start":140.158,"stop":155.615,"duration":15.46},{"text":"During the time that Parmelee performed the service, the service was regulated by the City of Chicago along with taxicab service and other similar services by what is known as Chapter 28 of the Municipal Code of Chicago.","start":155.615,"stop":175.92,"duration":20.3},{"text":"On June -- in June of 1955, the railroads notified Parmelee that as of October 1 of that year, they would discontinue using Parmelee service and would use petitioner instead.","start":175.92,"stop":197.279,"duration":21.36},{"text":"About a month later in July of 1955, the City Council of Chicago passed an amendment to Chapter 28 that I've already mentioned, that imposed two very serious obstacles or barricades to petitioner and the railroads

briefly here that the evidence shows in that earlier case and it is set out both in the opinion of this Court and in the opinion of the Court of Appeals which this Court affirmed, that this action of the Chicago City Council in amending Chapter 28 as I've said, was a well-planned, well-conceived scheme to keep -- to perpetuate Parmelee in the service and to keep -- and to put petitioner out of business.","start":275.996,"stop":324.847,"duration":48.85},{"text":"After the decision of this case in the Atchison -- after the decision in the Atchison case by this Court in 1958, that restored the status quo regulatory wise that had prevailed as to this interstation transfer service before the 1955 Amendment.","start":324.847,"stop":352.591,"duration":27.74},{"text":"In other words, in order to leave regulation or have regulation of the same type that had covered Parmelee for many years, all the City of Council had to do was simply do nothing.","start":352.591,"stop":368.529,"duration":15.94},{"text":"But shortly after -- a few months after the mandate came down in the former Atchison case, the Chicago City Council started on a course of amendment of Chapter 28 again to the great detriment of petitioner and the Chicago Railroad.","start":368.529,"stop":394.95,"duration":26.42},{"text":"The Council amended Chapter -- Section 28-6 of Chapter 28 by requiring that annually a person desiring a license to operate as a public passenger vehicle must file an application with the -- well, they already had to file an application

to pursue the occupation of a cabman or a coachman.","start":394.95,"stop":446.422,"duration":51.47},{"text":"Now that phrase qualified to pursue the application of a cabman or a coachman included petitioner within its scope because petitioner was defined as a coachman in the ordinance.","start":446.422,"stop":459.966,"duration":13.54},{"text":"It also included taxicabs for the most part but taxicabs operators already had to prove that they -- the public convenience and necessity before conducting any operation since they were an intrastate operation, presumably that was valid, at least it's never been challenged as to the taxicabs.","start":459.966,"stop":485.086,"duration":25.12},{"text":"In other words, this Amendment in 1959 to Section 28-6 the -- almost the entire force of it fell up on the petitioner.","start":485.086,"stop":499.249,"duration":14.16},{"text":"This phrase qualified to pursue the occupation of a coachman was not in any sense, could not -- cannot in any sense, we submit, be considered a regulation within the legitimate police power.","start":499.249,"stop":517.051,"duration":17.8},{"text":"It gave a discretion to the Public Vehicle License Commissioner to -- in his discretion, deny the application for a certificate to perform this service.","start":517.051,"stop":531.942,"duration":14.89},{"text":"And so we say that -- and we cited the only case we can find on the point, the decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee that the phrase “qualified to pursue the occupation” is a -- in substance a part of the proof that has to be made in proving public convenience and necessity.","start":531.942,"stop":556.742,"duration":24.8},{"text":"So the Chicago City Council got back on the old -- in 1959, got back on the old 1955 track.","start":556.742,"stop":566.736,"duration":9.99},{"text":"The Council amended another section, Section 28-31 of Chapter 28 required taxicab operators to furnish annually to the Public Vehicle

would need to submit for the purpose of rate regulation.","start":566.736,"stop":606.499,"duration":39.76},{"text":"But the Council by a very clear and direct amendment to that provision required or made that provision applicable to petitioner.","start":606.499,"stop":623.057,"duration":16.56},{"text":"In other words, it's something that the petitioner whose sole responsibility as to the railroads to -- it's furnishing the same kind of financial data to the Commissioner as taxicab operators.","start":623.057,"stop":636.793,"duration":13.74},{"text":"Now
