cheaper than the Federal Power Commission had itself reflected in its approval of rates and so fort filed by independent producers such as Continental.","start":626.419,"stop":658.876,"duration":32.46},{"text":"So United is -- the point is that we are faced there with very active competition, the Federal Power Commission has itself ruled
