and review on appeal of a code record by an appellate court and as I started to say in the brief time available yesterday, it would appear that that is what the Seventh Amendment is all about.","start":22.225,"stop":45.394,"duration":23.17},{"text":"There is one line of cases running from Slocum versus the New York Life Insurance Company down to Galloway which was immediately postwar, I believe which examined into the effect of the Seventh Amendment on appellate court review and particularly on the power of the appellate court to reverse and dismiss as against the party who had won the verdict below.","start":45.394,"stop":78.143,"duration":32.75},{"text":"In the Slocum case, the Court was construing Pennsylvania law and it was said in that case, I think very flatly, that the appellate court has power to review the denial of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict but that the Seventh Amendment precludes the direction of judgment by the appellate court rather than the ordering of a new trial.","start":78.143,"stop":114.1,"duration":35.96},{"text":"The Supreme Court of the United States in that case eliminated, modified the judgment by eliminating the direction to enter judgment and substituted direction for a new trial.","start":114.1,"stop":126.725,"duration":12.63},{"text":"Following that case very closely was a Federal Employers' Liability Act case, the Young case at volume 232 of the official reports and that case following Slocum and citing Slocum said that even though there is no evidence of negligence for the jury a new trial should be granted rather than the dismissal or entry of judgment.","start":126.725,"stop":157.569,"duration":30.84},{"text":"Then came the Redman case at 295 of the reports.","start":157.569,"stop":166.683,"duration":9.11},{"text":"Justice -- Mr. Justice Van Devanter wrote that opinion as he did in the earlier case of Slocum some 20 years before and in that case

him.","start":166.683,"stop":199.482,"duration":32.8},{"text":"The Slocum case was distinguished in the Redman case on the ground of the insufficiency of -- on the ground that the insufficiency of

versus Kennedy which followed Slocum rather than Redman and then we had of course the -- what I believe was a very important case of Galloway which was construing not the power of an appellate court but the power of the trial judge with reference to the entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict.","start":221.999,"stop":252.571,"duration":30.57},{"text":"And there, even though it was the power of a trial judge which was at stake three justices dissented in that case.","start":252.571,"stop":261.13,"duration":8.56},{"text":"In that case, the dissent pointed out that in the English common law as reported in Parsons versus Bedford.","start":261.13,"stop":272.734,"duration":11.6},{"text":"There was no right or no power rather in an appellate court to reverse and dismiss a verdict winner out of court that the most that could be done was to grant a new trial.","start":272.734,"stop":285.064,"duration":12.33},{"text":"And that deserves some discussion because in the Redman case, the Court said there was that power and we discovered in reading the English common law cases that were cited in Redman that actually what was happening at the common law was this, that the nisi prius judges would go out on the circuit and try these cases with the juries would reserve difficult questions of law, would bring these questions back to the Court en banc at Westminster and obtain opinions from the group of judges, from the brother judges en banc.","start":285.064,"stop":327.363,"duration":42.3},{"text":"This was similar I think to a procedure where a judge on a trial level would call back
