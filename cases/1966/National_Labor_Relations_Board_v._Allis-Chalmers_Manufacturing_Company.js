about two months, from February 2 to April 19 and during that strike, 175 employees out of a unit of some 7400 crossed the picket lines at West Allis, and two at La Crosse.","start":101.237,"stop":122.759,"duration":21.52},{"text":"The 1962 strike lasted about a week and during that strike, 30 out of a unit of 5500 or so crossed the line.","start":122.759,"stop":133.484,"duration":10.73},{"text":"In accordance with the procedure specified in the union's constitution and bylaws, these strike working members were found by Union

way to affect the employment status of these members who were fined.","start":223.515,"stop":234.085,"duration":10.57},{"text":"And so the question here is whether the union fining of these members for crossing the picket line and the subsequent attempt to collect the fines by court action constitutes a violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the National Labor Relations Act which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain or coerce employees and the exercise of a right guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act.","start":234.085,"stop":265.62,"duration":31.53},{"text":"Section 7 in

laws.","start":361.569,"stop":381.701,"duration":20.13},{"text":"We also contend that no violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was established because the fined union member employees were not deprived
