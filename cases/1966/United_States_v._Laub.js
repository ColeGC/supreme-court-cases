stipulation that Mr. Travis did not \"bear\" a valid United States passport specifically endorsed to travel to Cuba could not or just standing there alone sustain a conviction if this Court were to conclude that the only way that you could violate Section 1185 would be if you had no passport at all when you left the United States.","start":47.399,"stop":82.573,"duration":35.17},{"text":"In other

conducted.","start":127.297,"stop":148.171,"duration":20.87},{"text":"Now, we think that's what Bryan versus United States in 338 U.S. held when it construed 28 U.S.C. 2106 to authorize a remand for a retrial and that's in effect what this Court did as to a substantial number of the petitioners in the Yates case in 354 U.S. so that so far as the stipulation is concern as I say, we would -- we concede that her conviction could not just simply be affirmed if our major position is rejected.","start":148.171,"stop":174.814,"duration":26.64},{"text":"On the other hand, we do think that we should be permitted to a retrial on this indictment which simply charges a violation of 1185 pretty much in its terms and to prove at such a retrial that she in fact had only a revoked passport and

else.","start":174.814,"stop":200.705,"duration":25.89},{"text":"The statute on its face plainly we think, prohibits that if it prohibits

intent at the time he departed the United States.","start":445.82,"stop":457.057,"duration":11.24},{"text":"And it's a very difficult burden that was established in this case and in Laub, the Government had such proof.","start":457.057,"stop":468.608,"duration":11.55},{"text":"If I -- and then if I may just respond Mr. Chief Justice in Mr. McTernan's comment that 18 U.S.C. 1544 is noble and was not cited in response to the Senate Committee's question.","start":468.608,"stop":483.91,"duration":15.3},{"text":"The answer at least so far as it appears in the hearings on page 59 specifically does cite 18 U.S.C. 44.","start":483.91,"stop":491.535,"duration":7.63},{"text":"The Department of State responded that there are laws in which might well be violating the course of such travel, e.g. trading that the enemy act and treasury regulations there under, 18 U.S.C. 1544, etcetera.","start":491.535,"stop":502.989,"duration":11.45},{"text":"So, it was specifically cited at that time and it appeared in the passports.","start":502.989,"stop":508.008,"duration":5.02},{"text":"So, I think it's quite clear that this other statute is not a noble creation of the Department of State just raised for purpose of this case.","start":508.008,"stop":521.162,"duration":13.15},{"text":"Turning to the Laub case, that case is here on direct appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeals Act from a dismissal of a one count indictment charging nine appellees with conspiring to violate Section 1185 by inducing and recruiting a group of individuals to depart the United States for Cuba without bearing passports valid for travel to that destination.","start":521.162,"stop":545.004,"duration":23.84},{"text":"In this case, unlike Travis the status of the traveler's passport is clear.","start":545.004,"stop":549.759,"duration":4.75},{"text":"It was made so by the Government's bill of particulars which alleged that all the persons referred to in the indictment, in other words those who were traveling posses during the relevant period unexpired and unrevoked United States passports which however had not been specifically validated by the Secretary of State to travel to Cuba.","start":549.759,"stop":569.509,"duration":19.75},{"text":"So, this case does not involve the ambiguity presented in Travis.","start":569.509,"stop":575.649,"duration":6.14},{"text":"Two of the appellees here, Laub and Luce (ph) were also named in a companion indictment which charged them and two others with having arranged an earlier similar trip to Cuba one year prior to the trip involved in this indictment in June 1963 and with having made trips to Cuba in violation of Section 215 (b).","start":575.649,"stop":595.448,"duration":19.8},{"text":"The defendants in that case except Luce were tried in the Eastern District of New York in a non-jury trial at the conclusion of which the District judge found them all not guilty.","start":595.448,"stop":605.944,"duration":10.5},{"text":"His opinion in that case which contains extensive factual findings and an elaborate discussion of a law was incorporated by reference since the judgment of dismissal in this case because the grounds of this -- for dismissing the indictment here were identical to his grounds for entering a verdict of not guilty in that case.","start":605.944,"stop":625.055,"duration":19.11},{"text":"The judgments in both cases rested on the District judge's conclusion that Section 1185 (b) did not cover departures for destinations on which travel restrictions have been imposed.","start":625.055,"stop":636.664,"duration":11.61},{"text":"The judge in the present case in other words agree with the principle contention made by the petitioner in Travis that Section 215 (b) is only a \"border control statute\" ends the question of statutory construction squarely presented.","start":636.664,"stop":651.79,"duration":15.13},{"text":"Now, I find and I'd like to continue along that line in discussing what really was the major thrust of the District judge's opinion, the District Court's opinion in this case and of the claimed made by the petitioners which is -- and this relates back to a question of Mr. Justice Harlan's yesterday, \"What the administrative practice of the Department of State was?\"","start":651.79,"stop":672.862,"duration":21.07},{"text":"Now, the District Judge here found and petitioners have argued in Travis and the appellees have found -- have argued here that it was a Department of State's continuous position up until travel restriction were posed in Cuba that the restrictions put in to the passport as to the invalidity of the passport to travel to certain destinations were civil only and contemplated no criminal sanctions.","start":672.862,"stop":698.606,"duration":25.74},{"text":"Now, as I try to explain in the earlier argument -- in the Travis case, the real difficulty here arises out of the fact that there are two criminal statutes which might apply to travel to restricted areas.","start":698.606,"stop":713.843,"duration":15.24},{"text":"One is the one which prohibits use of a passport in violation of its terms and conditions and which would be violated therefore if the traveler in the foreign country used the passport to enter the country, showed it or in some other way exhibited it.","start":713.843,"stop":728.819,"duration":14.98},{"text":"That's 18 U.S.C. 1544 and we submit that it's quite clear from the administrative practice that the Department of State had always viewed that statute which applies both in peace time and in war time as applicable when there is proof of use.","start":728.819,"stop":747.763,"duration":18.94},{"text":"Now, petitioner or the -- and the -- petitioner in Travis and the appellees here and the District judge below relied on certain statements made by the Department of State in 1919 and 1952 and in 1957.","start":747.763,"stop":766.284,"duration":18.52},{"text":"I think those really do not support the conclusion that the Department of State was in effect disavowing criminal sanctions for violations of area restrictions and I'll get to that in a minute.","start":766.284,"stop":781.144,"duration":14.86},{"text":"But I would also like to call attention what is quite clear and what is not been cited out below and it was -- it's not cited and discussed in our brief either but it's quite -- what is quite clear is a press release for example issued or press release issued at the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 where the Department of State announced that passports which are therefore been issued would not be valid for use and travel from United States to any country in Europe unless it is submitted to the Department of State for validation.","start":781.144,"stop":817.193,"duration":36.05},{"text":"Now, that announcement which appears at page 534 of Hackworth which is cited in our brief and in the volumes cited in our brief and in the briefs in Travis and Laub and by the District judge also says the same thing as the passports themselves said which is, should a person to whom a passport has been issued use it in violation of the conditions or restrictions contained therein the protection of the United States may likewise be withheld from him while he's abroad and he will be liable for prosecution under the provisions of Section 221 of Title 22 of the U.S. Code which reads in part and then it quotes that statute.","start":817.193,"stop":858.211,"duration":41.02},{"text":"In other words, the very press release that announced that there -- restrictions would be imposed prior to World War II specifically referred to what is now 18 U.S.C. 1544.","start":858.211,"stop":870.556,"duration":12.35},{"text":"Now, it's true that the Department of State did not at that time refer to this statute.","start":870.556,"stop":875.901,"duration":5.34},{"text":"The very simple reason is that this statute was not on the books.","start":875.901,"stop":878.763,"duration":2.86},{"text":"Its predecessor was not on the books either.","start":878.763,"stop":880.953,"duration":2.19},{"text":"This statute was enacted in 1914 to apply only in time of war.","start":880.953,"stop":886.284,"duration":5.33},{"text":"It was reenacted in 1941 to apply in time of war and during the national emergency which have been declared by President Roosevelt in May of 1941.","start":886.284,"stop":896.09,"duration":9.81},{"text":"It was reenacted in 1952 to apply in time of war and during any national emergency.","start":896.09,"stop":901.889,"duration":5.8},{"text":"Well, the time that restrictions were imposed prior to World War II, Section 1185 or its predecessor which just not a viable statute.","start":901.889,"stop":913.694,"duration":11.8},{"text":"Now, the District Court below or the petitioner in Travis and the appellees here point to really three statements, public release as issued by the Department of State.","start":913.694,"stop":924.605,"duration":10.91},{"text":"One was the release issued in 1919 when hostilities were over and which did not refer to any criminal sanction.","start":924.605,"stop":931.145,"duration":6.54},{"text":"Well, that's true.","start":931.145,"stop":933.224,"duration":2.08},{"text":"I mean it certainly didn't refer to the predecessor of Section 1185 because 1185 apply only in time of war and it was very questionable whether it could've applied then.","start":933.224,"stop":944.258,"duration":11.03},{"text":"They also rely on the press release issued in 1952 when restrictions were imposed on travel to iron curtain countries.","start":944.258,"stop":951.763,"duration":7.5},{"text":"But 1952 was two years after President Truman had announced the -- a nation -- a new national emergency in 1950.","start":951.763,"stop":960.407,"duration":8.64},{"text":"The Act passed in 1941 was no longer applicable at the time the new area restrictions were imposed.","start":960.407,"stop":966.412,"duration":6},{"text":"The Act passed in 1941 applied when the United States is at war or during the national emergency announced in May of 1941.","start":966.412,"stop":976.059,"duration":9.65},{"text":"By 1952, the United States was not technically at war and the national emergency announced in 1941 had been superseded by the national emergency announced in 1950.","start":976.059,"stop":986.11,"duration":10.05},{"text":"So, obviously the restrictions imposed in 1952 could not have made any reference to the statute enacted in 1941 because it too was not a viable statute at that time.","start":986.11,"stop":997.631,"duration":11.52},{"text":"A month later after the imposition to travel restrictions then, the statute involved here was enacted in that provided that it was to apply that in times of war and in times of national emergency and of course that statute was applicable thereafter.","start":997.631,"stop":1017.018,"duration":19.39},{"text":"It was not specifically cited in the -- or specifically listed in the passports, the other statute was 18 U.S.C.

we want here is equally appropriate.","start":2964.169,"stop":2992.953,"duration":28.78},{"text":"And Mr. Heymann then addressed himself to the second problem that was discussed here by Mr. McTernan,
