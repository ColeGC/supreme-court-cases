the residue, a very substantial sum of money was paid for death duties.","start":336.292,"stop":347.186,"duration":10.89},{"text":"Those death duties, of course, are not deductible items in computing taxes.","start":347.186,"stop":353.031,"duration":5.85},{"text":"Therefore, the moneys that we use for the payment of the death duties also generate estate taxes and they are involved here.","start":353.031,"stop":369.576,"duration":16.55},{"text":"The executers, of course, were aware of the problem that faced them in this matter and of the importance of it to the widow and to the

estate tax return.","start":387.409,"stop":396.554,"duration":9.14},{"text":"And they computed their tax obligations there on the premise that no part of these taxes, which I have described were to be

treatment.","start":415.547,"stop":420.55,"duration":5},{"text":"And eventually, they said that a deficiency would be assessed on that account.","start":420.55,"stop":431.493,"duration":10.94},{"text":"Now, such a deficiency, as I indicated in my opening sentence, turns entirely upon the law of Connecticut and upon the amount of money that is distributable under Connecticut law to the will.","start":431.493,"stop":453.128,"duration":21.63},{"text":"It does not involve any interpretation of the Internal Revenue

court.","start":476.884,"stop":488.309,"duration":11.43},{"text":"So at that time -- excuse me a moment -- the executor's filed their first accounting.","start":488.309,"stop":500.267,"duration":11.96},{"text":"I should say in Connecticut that all the states have judicial counties.","start":500.267,"stop":506.541,"duration":6.27},{"text":"They filed that first accounting which showed the payment of all of the death duties that had been assessed at that time.","start":506.541,"stop":517.956,"duration":11.42},{"text":"This was a statutory obligation of the executor's.","start":517.956,"stop":522.544,"duration":4.59},{"text":"They also accompanied their administration account with a petition to the Court to rule on this matter concerning the proration of estate taxes.","start":522.544,"stop":535.445,"duration":12.9},{"text":"And accompanying that petition, they filed a proposed computation of the tax following the same premise that they had used in their federal estate tax return.","start":535.445,"stop":552.596,"duration":17.15},{"text":"Now, the Government seems to think that in doing that, the executor's were engaging in some slick trick.","start":552.596,"stop":563.162,"duration":10.57},{"text":"It's not clear from the Government's brief but the implication I think is, that the executor's should not have taken this matter to the fede -- to the probate court but should have let it to the decision perhaps of some federal tribunal which one I don't know.","start":563.162,"stop":578.971,"duration":15.81},{"text":"Certainly, the District Court has no probate jurisdiction and neither does the tax court.","start":578.971,"stop":589.809,"duration":10.84},{"text":"The executor's and I wish to make this abundantly clear, had no alternative but to ask the probate court to do this because it involved an adjudication of property rights under the law of Connecticut and under the decedent's will.","start":589.809,"stop":614.027,"duration":24.22},{"text":"The executor's would not have been able to charge these taxes that are in question against either the widow or against the grandchildren without having obtained an order from the probate court.","start":614.027,"stop":630.57,"duration":16.54},{"text":"And if you examined the decree that was finally issued, you will see that it authorizes the executor's to make charges for these taxes against the grandchildren's share.","start":630.57,"stop":645.965,"duration":15.39},{"text":"The -- at one point in its brief, the Government states that this was an effort to avoid estate taxes on the part of the executor's, but that is not true.","start":645.965,"stop":659.792,"duration":13.83},{"text":"It was a vital step

for filing a report.","start":847.717,"stop":853.49,"duration":5.77},{"text":"And he did file a report dated December 22nd in which -- which is in the record.","start":853.49,"stop":860.786,"duration":7.3},{"text":"And in which he said that he had considered this matter, and despite the adverse financial affect upon the -- his words rights, he thought that the computation that had been made by the executor's was the proper one to make under Connecticut law.","start":860.786,"stop":887.826,"duration":27.04},{"text":"The report that he filed -- he filed a formal report and he also filed a letter.","start":887.826,"stop":892.908,"duration":5.08},{"text":"He submitted a letter to the judge explaining his position.","start":892.908,"stop":898.245,"duration":5.34},{"text":"And soon after that, if not immediately, the judge of probate passed his order and issued a short memorandum from which it appears that he clearly understood all of the issues that were involved, he understood the importance of the property rights that were at stake and he understood too the effect that this would have upon federal taxes.","start":898.245,"stop":924.488,"duration":26.24},{"text":"And he cited in his memorandum the leading Connecticut authorities on the question and said that the computation as submitted by the executors was correct, and he ordered that the bequest of the grandchildren be charged with these taxes and were attributable to the residuary properties.","start":924.488,"stop":954.119,"duration":29.63},{"text":"Now, the law of Connecticut on this matter is rather simple.","start":954.119,"stop":960.844,"duration":6.73},{"text":"And I think the law of Connecticut agrees with the law in most of the states where they have apportionment statutes at least it's identical with the law in the State of New York.","start":960.844,"stop":974.219,"duration":13.38},{"text":"And that is the -- the law is this that the apportionment statute was enacted to achieve equitable and remedial ends.","start":974.219,"stop":985.758,"duration":11.54},{"text":"That's a fair thing because it places upon each legacy the portion of the estate taxes that where legacy generates.","start":985.758,"stop":996.737,"duration":10.98},{"text":"Therefore, the Court says that while the testator may direct against apportionment, if he wants to make a direction, his words

unambiguous.","start":1022.327,"stop":1045.799,"duration":23.47},{"text":"In the first case that came up in Connecticut, there was a direction on the will, pay all taxes out of the residue.","start":1045.799,"stop":1053.97,"duration":8.17},{"text":"In that case, it happened that the testator had constructed some inter vivos trusts and a question arose as to whether or not the residuary estate should pay the tax on the inter vivos trusts.","start":1053.97,"stop":1067.775,"duration":13.81},{"text":"And the Court said,

there arose here.","start":1094.243,"stop":1097.101,"duration":2.86},{"text":"It was a gift to the widow that qualified for a tax exemption in the residue.","start":1097.101,"stop":1104.232,"duration":7.13},{"text":"And the Court said that the direction to pay all taxes out of the residue was not a direction against proration within the -- or
