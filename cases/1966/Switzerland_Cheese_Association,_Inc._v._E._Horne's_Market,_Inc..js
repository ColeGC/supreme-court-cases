caused to deter the event.","start":37.718,"stop":49.734,"duration":12.02},{"text":"It reaches the Court on certiorari to the First Circuit and involves interpretation of that section of the judicial

injunction.”","start":49.734,"stop":77.049,"duration":27.32},{"text":"The question here is whether this language authorizes an appeal from an interlocutory order which refused a permanent injunction prayed for in a motion for summary judgment.","start":77.049,"stop":94.286,"duration":17.24},{"text":"The language of the statute is plain, simple and unconditional in authorizing appeals from refusals of injunction for all purposes.","start":94.286,"stop":108.779,"duration":14.49},{"text":"We therefore urge the Court to answer the Court in the affirmative.","start":108.779,"stop":117.286,"duration":8.51},{"text":"We do not prevent the issue as an abstract proposition but rather in the context of a cause in regard to which the refusal of the

the trade name and the cheese and of course it causes financial loss to these petitioners.","start":224.958,"stop":237.228,"duration":12.27},{"text":"Accordingly, by way of summary judgment procedure,
