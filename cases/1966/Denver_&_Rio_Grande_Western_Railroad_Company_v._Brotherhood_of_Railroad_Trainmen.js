represented.","start":162.194,"stop":176.838,"duration":14.64},{"text":"The Board sustained the claims and it awarded a full days pay for each claimant for each occasion in which it found a violation

hours.","start":220.165,"stop":222.657,"duration":2.49},{"text":"It was enjoined by the District Court and subsequently the District Court and the Court of Appeals both held that the strike was in

held that respondent Carroll is not responsible for the strike and should have been dismissed.","start":283.581,"stop":290.506,"duration":6.92},{"text":"As I shall develop in the argument, this decision by the Court of Appeals to the Tenth Circuit as directly in conflict with the holding of the Second Circuit in the so-called Rutland case and it is also in conflict with basic venue principles.","start":290.506,"stop":306.366,"duration":15.86},{"text":"The venue issue, which is dominant and controlling here involves Section 1391 of Title XXVIII, which provides in part that non-diversity actions may be brought only in the judicial district in which all defendants reside.","start":306.366,"stop":322.499,"duration":16.13},{"text":"The requirement of residence imposed by this 1948 enactment is not defined insofar as unincorporated associations are concerned.","start":322.499,"stop":332.725,"duration":10.23},{"text":"And in this respect, Congress adhered to the pattern of prior legislation because the statute which was superseded by the 1948 enactment was also silent with respect to the meaning of the venue requirement which it imposed.","start":332.725,"stop":348.792,"duration":16.07},{"text":"But prior to 1948, the venue statute provided that no civil suit shall be brought in any District Court against any person in any other district and that whereof he is an inhabitant.","start":348.792,"stop":362.575,"duration":13.78},{"text":"The absence of elaboration, the definition of inhabitants was necessarily left to the Courts.","start":362.575,"stop":368.631,"duration":6.06},{"text":"As to one incorporated associations, the governing determination was made by Judge Hand in Sperry Products versus the Association of American Railroads.","start":368.631,"stop":378.743,"duration":10.11},{"text":"In Sperry Products, the relevant statute provided that in patent infringement actions, venue was proper in the district in which the defendant was an inhabitant or in which the defendant had committed acts of infringement and maintain the regular and established place of business.","start":378.743,"stop":396.224,"duration":17.48},{"text":"Judge Hand approached the venue problem in that case by determining first that unincorporated associations should be regarded as entities for venue purposes since existing law regarded them as entities for other procedural incidence such as capacity to sue and to be sued.","start":396.224,"stop":415.967,"duration":19.74},{"text":"Turning next to the question of location to be attributed to the entity, Judge Hand concluded that unincorporated associations should be considered to be present wherever they were continuously carrying on a substantial part of their business just as corporations were regarded as present in such circumstance.","start":415.967,"stop":436.616,"duration":20.65},{"text":"To determine the inhabitants of unincorporated associations, Judge Hand continued to rely on the status of corporations and thus concluded that inhabitants was limited to a single district, that of the association's principal place of business.","start":436.616,"stop":455.056,"duration":18.44},{"text":"The Sperry case does establish the principle that for venue purposes an incorporated associations should be regarded as jural entities and that their inhabitants, the term synonymous with residence in the present Section 1391 should be determined by analogy to the corporate entities which they most closely resemble.","start":455.056,"stop":478.496,"duration":23.44},{"text":"As Judge Hand stated the matter, it is really the only practicable test.","start":478.496,"stop":483.885,"duration":5.39},{"text":"Since inhabitants was the requirement not only of the patent infringement statute but also of the general venue statute at that time, Sperry Products continued to be a controlling authority with respect to venue questions arising as to an incorporated associations under the general venue statute.","start":483.885,"stop":503.527,"duration":19.64},{"text":"In 1948, when Congress revised the Judicial Code, venue in non-diversity cases was stated in terms of residence rather than inhabitants, again, without elaboration as to defendants other than corporations.","start":503.527,"stop":519.097,"duration":15.57},{"text":"Section 1391 (c), however, did define corporate residence in terms of the judicial districts in which a corporation is licensed to do or is doing business.","start":519.097,"stop":533.352,"duration":14.25},{"text":"This definition of corporate residence obviously changed the frame of reference for application of this very principle.","start":533.352,"stop":542.332,"duration":8.98},{"text":"Reliance on the corporate analogy, which was Judge Hand's basic approach in Sperry would after 1948 require consideration of the definition of residence appearing in Section 1301 (c).","start":542.332,"stop":557.453,"duration":15.12},{"text":"But this 1948 change did not impair the Sperry principle which was unquestioned at that time insofar as unincorporated associations are concerned.","start":557.453,"stop":568.7,"duration":11.25},{"text":"Moreover, the legislative history of the 1948 revision does not indicate any purpose to a negative or to restrict the application of the Sperry principle or to impose venue requirements for unincorporated associations differing from those which would result from proper regard to that judicial authority.","start":568.7,"stop":589.198,"duration":20.5},{"text":"Professor Moore, who was importantly concerned with the 1948 revision, has stated that Section 1391 was intended to continue and to build on a trend of judicial decisions relating to venue.","start":589.198,"stop":603.513,"duration":14.32},{"text":"As to unincorporated association, the trend of judicial decisions was unmistakably chartered by Sperry, existing that judicial authority would thus clearly require an analysis and treatment of residence for unincorporated associations insistent with that applicable to corporations.","start":603.513,"stop":624.321,"duration":20.81},{"text":"Certainly, the decided cases under the 1948 provisions support this conclusion.","start":624.321,"stop":630.403,"duration":6.08},{"text":"Since the 1948 revision of the judicial code, many cases upheld that consistent with Sperry residents, for unincorporated associations must be defined by reference to the corporate analogy.","start":630.403,"stop":644.681,"duration":14.28},{"text":"The leading authority, as I have stated, is the Rutland case where the Brotherhood in this case and other railroad unions argued that venue in Vermont was improper since they were doing -- since their principal headquarters were located elsewhere.","start":644.681,"stop":660.169,"duration":15.49},{"text":"In a holding against respondent, the other defendant, Judge Waterman in the Rutland case held that the provisions of the 1948 Judicial Code must be viewed in the light of preexisting law, principally Sperry Products and has thus view the residents requirement of Section 1391 was satisfied by showing that the defendant unions were doing business in the district in question.","start":660.169,"stop":689,"duration":28.83},{"text":"As Judge Waterman stated, we believe this accords with the practical requirement of litigation involving unincorporated associations.","start":689,"stop":698.562,"duration":9.56},{"text":"There are a substantial number of other decisions to the same effect and these decisions has been analyzed and characterized by Professor Moore as desirable and justified under the 1948 venue provisions.","start":698.562,"stop":714.056,"duration":15.49},{"text":"The decision of the Court of Appeals in this case is obviously in conflict with these decisions.","start":714.056,"stop":720.199,"duration":6.14},{"text":"The Rutland case and the other decisions to which I have referred also effectuate the liberalizing purpose of the 1948 amendments to the venue code.","start":720.199,"stop":730.594,"duration":10.4},{"text":"This Court in Pure Oil Company versus Suarez emphasized to that congressional purpose when it held that the definition of residence appearing in Section 1391 (c) should be read into the venue requirements of the Jones Act which had theretofore been interpreted to limit venue to a corporation's principal place of business or state of incorporation.","start":730.594,"stop":753.881,"duration":23.29},{"text":"This Court emphasized in liberalizing purpose underlying the enactment of Section 1391 and held that in the absence of restrictive indications, this purpose should be implemented by judicial updating of the 1920 venue provisions of the Judicial Code.","start":753.881,"stop":773.288,"duration":19.41},{"text":"There is also no indication in the legislative history of Section 1391 or in the terms of the statute which indicates any intent to restrict the principle of Sperry Products which would define residence for unincorporated association by reference to the corporate situation.","start":773.288,"stop":793.262,"duration":19.97},{"text":"The decision of the Court of Appeals in this case is also contrary to basic venue principles, which clearly establish that the Judicial District of Colorado is the most appropriate form for this particular proceeding.","start":793.262,"stop":807.431,"duration":14.17},{"text":"This Court stated these basic venue principles in Pure Oil Company versus Suarez where it noted that the venue provisions of Section 1391 constituted a response to a general conviction; that it was intolerable if traditional concepts of presence and residence kept the corporation from being sued wherever it was creating liabilities.","start":807.431,"stop":831.516,"duration":24.08},{"text":"In the earlier case of Neirbo Company versus Bethlehem Corporation, where this Court dealt comprehensively with venue questions, the underlying basis of the decision was that venue, though defined by legislation relates to the convenience of litigants.","start":831.516,"stop":849.072,"duration":17.56},{"text":"These principles are fully applicable to a non-incorporated association carrying on multistate business activity.","start":849.072,"stop":857.618,"duration":8.55},{"text":"Colorado, of course, is the place where the Denver & Rio Grande Western maintained its headquarters where it conducts a majority of its operations and where it handles labor problems which arise and which involves Brotherhood Railroad Trainmen.","start":857.618,"stop":872.822,"duration":15.2},{"text":"The unlawful strike occurred primarily in Colorado and most of the employees participating in the strike work and reside in Colorado.","start":872.822,"stop":882.69,"duration":9.87},{"text":"Furthermore, the entire collective bargaining relationship between the Rio Grande and the Brotherhood as Colorado as its focal point.","start":882.69,"stop":891.592,"duration":8.9},{"text":"Although the national entity is the certified

Denver, Colorado.","start":891.592,"stop":908.514,"duration":16.92},{"text":"It is also clear that the national entity headquartered in Cleveland performs its functions on the Rio Grande primarily in the Judicial District of Colorado.","start":908.514,"stop":919.714,"duration":11.2},{"text":"The Brotherhood consists of a grand lodge at Cleveland and local lodges situated on each railroad including the Rio Grande.","start":919.714,"stop":927.267,"duration":7.55},{"text":"With respect to grievances, these local lodges and particularly the General Grievance Committee are invested with virtually complete authority to initiate and handle claims on behalf of trainmen including ultimate reference to the National Railroad Adjustment Board.","start":927.267,"stop":943.898,"duration":16.63},{"text":"The General Grievance Committee and its constituents committees are also giving primary jurisdiction to handle disputes which arise when proposed changes in the agreements are under consideration.","start":943.898,"stop":957.821,"duration":13.92},{"text":"The real and primary authority of the General Grievance Committee headquartered at Denver, is illustrated by General Rule 13 of the Brotherhood which provide that whatever action may be taken by the General Grievance Committee shall be law to the lodges on that road until reversed by the Board of Appeal.","start":957.821,"stop":979.477,"duration":21.66},{"text":"Although the president of the Brotherhood headquartered at Cleveland does exercise supervisory or appellate authority, the Brotherhood's activities on behalf of the employees of an individual railroad such as the Rio Grande, take place in the geographical area where the railroad operates.","start":979.477,"stop":999.292,"duration":19.82},{"text":"Even in the case of strike action on an individual railroad joined authority by the president of the Brotherhood and the General Grievance Committee locally headquartered must be obtained.","start":999.292,"stop":1011.677,"duration":12.38},{"text":"The president may authorize the strike only if the General Grievance Committee joins with them in such authorization.","start":1011.677,"stop":1019.758,"duration":8.08},{"text":"These circumstances that, I submit, make it highly unreasonable to suggest that Cleveland, Ohio rather than the Judicial District of Colorado is the proper case -- proper forum in which to litigate the liability of the Brotherhood in this case.","start":1019.758,"stop":1035.363,"duration":15.61},{"text":"The Brotherhood's business are representing employees on the Rio Grande although based on certification of a national entity is conducted by the Brotherhood in Colorado.","start":1035.363,"stop":1048.267,"duration":12.9},{"text":"The Court of Appeals in this case in deciding that Cleveland, Ohio was the proper forum, was governed entirely by its interpretation of this Court's opinion in Steelworkers versus Bouligny.","start":1048.267,"stop":1062.494,"duration":14.23},{"text":"And that the Court of Appeals did not attempt any statutory interpretation.","start":1062.494,"stop":1066.428,"duration":3.93},{"text":"It did not in fact express any basic disagreement with the principle of the Rutland case.","start":1066.428,"stop":1072.827,"duration":6.4},{"text":"It said instead, that the Steelworkers was an implicit rejection of the principle of the Rutland case and that venue would thus be proper only at Cleveland.","start":1072.827,"stop":1083.789,"duration":10.96},{"text":"To consider the application of Steelworkers to the venue problem, I wish to emphasize first that from the time of Sperry Products in 1942 until this case, the venue of unincorporated associations was deemed to defend on two largely unchallenged premises.","start":1083.789,"stop":1103.562,"duration":19.77},{"text":"One, that for venue purposes, such associations should be regarded as entities having a residence in their own right.","start":1103.562,"stop":1112.804,"duration":9.24},{"text":"And two, that the residence should be determined not by a new test fashion for unincorporated associations but by analogy to

case, into the law of venue, strikes at this settled fundamentals of venue law.","start":1125.349,"stop":1136.78,"duration":11.43},{"text":"Steelworkers had nothing to do with venue and this Court said nothing in its opinion about venue problem.","start":1136.78,"stop":1143.668,"duration":6.89},{"text":"Rather, the issue before the Court was whether a non-incorporated labor union is to be treated as a citizen for purposes of federal diversity jurisdiction without regard to the citizenship of its members.","start":1143.668,"stop":1157.11,"duration":13.44},{"text":"The lower court, following the rule which have been recognized since 1889 had held that for diversity purposes, a non-incorporated association is an aggregation of individuals and thus has the citizenship of each of its members.","start":1157.11,"stop":1172.72,"duration":15.61},{"text":"This Court affirmed, stressing the fact that if unincorporated associations were to be treated as entities for diversity purposes, that considerable expansion in the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal Courts would result.","start":1172.72,"stop":1185.891,"duration":13.17},{"text":"There's nothing in this holding which has any relevance to venue.","start":1185.891,"stop":1189.317,"duration":3.43},{"text":"To hold that a non-incorporated association is an aggregation of individuals for a diversity of jurisdiction purposes is to avoid changing established principles applicable to federal jurisdiction.","start":1189.317,"stop":1203.058,"duration":13.74},{"text":"On the other hand, to hold that a non-incorporated association is an aggregation of individuals for venue purposes would be to overturn entirely venue doctrine that has been accepted for the last 25 years.","start":1203.058,"stop":1217.062,"duration":14},{"text":"There is no reason why different rules should not exist in these two different areas of the law.","start":1217.062,"stop":1223.132,"duration":6.07},{"text":"The rules differ because the considerations which underlie them differed.","start":1223.132,"stop":1227.649,"duration":4.52},{"text":"As this Court has held, the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, their power to adjudicate is a grant of authority to them by Congress but the locality of the lawsuit, the place where judicial authority may be exercised though defined by legislation, relates to the convenience of the litigants.","start":1227.649,"stop":1250.022,"duration":22.37},{"text":"Thus, for example, jurisdiction is beyond the scope of litigants to confer that venue is subject to their disposition.","start":1250.022,"stop":1258.946,"duration":8.92},{"text":"The inapplicability of Steelworkers to the determination of the venue problems presented by this case is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the fact that although the lower court purported to rely on Steelworkers, it failed to apply the principle of Steelworkers in reaching the result which it reached in this case.","start":1258.946,"stop":1278.325,"duration":19.38},{"text":"Under Steelworkers, a non-incorporated association being considered an aggregation of individuals, with each of the associations
