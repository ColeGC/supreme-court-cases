items.","start":490.44,"stop":497.896,"duration":7.46},{"text":"As no regard at all to insurance, it's obviously urging people as they say to participate in the upsurge of our economy, and to them, that this is in the large record at page 10, the whole brochure there.","start":497.896,"stop":516.304,"duration":18.41},{"text":"The contract is represented as providing, “A chance to share in the growth of the country's economy”, and in which the investments in this securities market is emphasized in various ways.","start":516.304,"stop":531.633,"duration":15.33},{"text":"We think that when such an interest, one that fluctuates with the value of the fund of securities is being offered and sold, it is our position then that it was intended that the investors be afforded the protections of the Federal Security Laws.","start":531.633,"stop":550.463,"duration":18.83},{"text":"The principal difference between the variable annuity in VALIC and the Flexible Fund is that the latter has a flaw; that is the Flexible Fund contract guarantees the purchaser a certain fixed minimum amount.","start":550.463,"stop":567.301,"duration":16.84},{"text":"The court below found that difference in the light of the VALIC decision could be so persuasive that the insurance exceptions are applicable to the Flexible Fund.","start":567.301,"stop":578.386,"duration":11.08},{"text":"So I would go into this minimum guarantee with so much reliance was placed upon.","start":578.386,"stop":584.875,"duration":6.49},{"text":"Respondent guarantees that upon withdrawal from participation in the fund, the purchaser shall receive not less than a stated percentage of its aggregate purchased payments.","start":584.875,"stop":598.719,"duration":13.84},{"text":"We have set that out on the charts on our brief on page 5, and also 34 and 37.","start":598.719,"stop":606.484,"duration":7.76},{"text":"But it's undeniable that the guarantee involved the assumption of some risk by the respondents, certainly that's true, but at some, with emphasis on some, although as I'll show, it's not an investment risk as it has been understood in the insurance acts.","start":606.484,"stop":624.734,"duration":18.25},{"text":"If that respondent contends the critical test is whether the issuing company assumes any element of “risk” by setting a flow no matter how low even one that is lower than the total payments made by the purchaser then I can see we're out of Court.","start":624.734,"stop":647.522,"duration":22.79},{"text":"However, I think as respondent derives that test from too personal reading of VALIC.","start":647.522,"stop":654.951,"duration":7.43},{"text":"Respondent's guaranteed minimum is always less than the aggregate payments made by the purchaser.","start":654.951,"stop":661.993,"duration":7.04},{"text":"After ten years, it does reach the extent of the net premiums which at that point is equivalent to about 86.5% of the total claims.","start":661.993,"stop":674.721,"duration":12.73},{"text":"And after 25 years, it approaches, but never reaches 90% of the total purchase payments.","start":674.721,"stop":680.883,"duration":6.16},{"text":"In short, as the amicus curiae persuasively showed in pages 30 to 38 of its brief, the respondent actually assumes no investment risk in the general sense of the word in the insurance vernacular, nor does it begin to reach what was mentioned in the VALIC case as being controlling, or in the sense commonly accepted in the insurance field.","start":680.883,"stop":706.641,"duration":25.76},{"text":"Investment risk involves the guarantee of some return on your capital, not merely the return of the capital itself.","start":706.641,"stop":716.53,"duration":9.89},{"text":"And as the majority said in VALIC, investment risk in insurance sense involves the guarantee of a fixed return and assured yields in one's investment.","start":716.53,"stop":728.986,"duration":12.46},{"text":"Neither the contract in VALIC nor the contract here has any such assured yield.","start":728.986,"stop":736.41,"duration":7.42},{"text":"In lieu of the guaranteed yield on the normal annuity policy, the purchase of either the Flexible Fund or the old VALIC contract looks

the respondent's skill to produce a yield far exceeding the return available on an ordinary annuity policy.","start":752.763,"stop":763.735,"duration":10.97},{"text":"But the short of it is that the touchstone of insurance, a fixed return or guaranteed yield on payments is entirely missing here and for the ultimate interest of a Flexible Fund contract, the purchaser depends on the value of the

respondent's fund would ensure the furnishing of information such as affiliation of the fund's directors, the semi-annual financial reports again, moreover, this substantial sales charge would be
