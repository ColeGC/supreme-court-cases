matter of fact, has denied that steadfastly throughout.","start":112.091,"stop":117.564,"duration":5.47},{"text":"And as a result, it is the finding of Communist Party membership by the District Court upon which the decision in this case hinges for as the Government appears to agree at page 17 of its brief, once the finding of past membership was made, the finding of false testimony inevitably file there from.","start":117.564,"stop":143.362,"duration":25.8},{"text":"And conversely, without the finding of such membership, the finding of false testimony could not have been made.","start":143.362,"stop":152.355,"duration":8.99},{"text":"Now the -- a brief background of this case is as follows.","start":152.355,"stop":156.708,"duration":4.35},{"text":"The petitioner is a Hungarian national, a medical doctor, who together with his wife fled Hungary in November of 1956, a few days after, the uprising was crushed.","start":156.708,"stop":172.142,"duration":15.43},{"text":"At that time together with thousands of other people, they escaped across the border into Austria.","start":172.142,"stop":177.593,"duration":5.45},{"text":"And the petitioner and his wife were in the following month, December of 1956, admitted to the United States as permanent residents.","start":177.593,"stop":187.581,"duration":9.99},{"text":"In January of 1962, after the lapse of the five-year statutory residence period, both the petitioner and his wife filed a petition for naturalization.","start":187.581,"stop":198.869,"duration":11.29},{"text":"And after an extended preliminary investigation and examination, the designated naturalization examiner in October of 1964 denied -- or pardon me, recommended the denial of both petitions upon the following grounds.","start":198.869,"stop":217.861,"duration":18.99},{"text":"With respect to the petitioner, a denial was recommended on the ground that he had been a member of the Communist Party within the ten years proceeding the filing of the petition and his membership does -- rendered him ineligible for citizenship under the provisions of Section 313 of the Act.","start":217.861,"stop":237.006,"duration":19.15},{"text":"Those provisions which born naturalization to a person who is a member of a proscribed organization listed therein.","start":237.006,"stop":244.296,"duration":7.29},{"text":"And the second ground upon which denial was recommended was that during the period to which petitioner was required to establish good moral conduct, the five years prior to the filing of the petition, he had therefore testified falsely as to such Communist Party membership in Hungary in order to facilitate his naturalization and was therefore by statutory definition rendered ineligible to be found to be a person of good moral character.","start":244.296,"stop":273.91,"duration":29.61},{"text":"Incidentally, the wife's petition was recommended to be denied on the ground that she too had testified falsely before the Immigration Service, in denying her husband's Communist Party membership and that she was therefore precluded from being deemed a person of good moral character under 101 (f) (6) of the Act.","start":273.91,"stop":295.322,"duration":21.41},{"text":"Both petitioner and his wife requested a hearing in open court as is their right under the statute.","start":295.322,"stop":301.863,"duration":6.54},{"text":"And the final hearing was a joint hearing on both petitions in the District Court.","start":301.863,"stop":307.387,"duration":5.52},{"text":"And on that final hearing, the Government produced two witnesses.","start":307.387,"stop":311.207,"duration":3.82},{"text":"Both of whom were Hungarian nationals and who had attended medical school at the University of Budapest during portions of the time that the petitioner had been a medical student there.","start":311.207,"stop":324.143,"duration":12.94},{"text":"The petitioner had attended medical school there from 1946 to 1952, it was a six-year course he graduated in 1952.","start":324.143,"stop":333.779,"duration":9.64},{"text":"At that time by the way, the medical classes at the University of Budapest averaged approximately five to 600 students in each year.","start":333.779,"stop":344.929,"duration":11.15},{"text":"Now the Government's principal witness of Dr. Kury, testified that he had entered medical school in 1948, the same year as the petitioner, but that for the first two years he had have no contact with the petitioner.","start":344.929,"stop":358.449,"duration":13.52},{"text":"At the beginning of the third year in September of 1948, Kury testified that he was assigned to a small study group of about 20 or so students that was scheduled to meet regularly every afternoon.","start":358.449,"stop":371.263,"duration":12.81},{"text":"The primary purpose of these study groups was to enable the students to discuss and review on a more intimate and closer level the medical subjects that they had been taught in the large lecture groups of several hundred students earlier in the day, and which by the very nature of the size of this classes precluded any sort of informal exchange of ideas.","start":371.263,"stop":393.919,"duration":22.66},{"text":"The medical subjects discussed in these groups was under the leadership of an upper classmen, a medical student from a higher grade.","start":393.919,"stop":403.136,"duration":9.22},{"text":"In addition, in as much as the communist where at this time the dominant political party in the Government and were also in control of the school administration.","start":403.136,"stop":413.22,"duration":10.08},{"text":"These study groups were also required to discuss the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and this aspect of their activity was to be under the direction of another student within the group, that is a student other than this leader of the Medical Studies.","start":413.22,"stop":430.392,"duration":17.17},{"text":"Now it's Kury's testimony that he attended only the first meeting of the study group in September of 1948.","start":430.392,"stop":437.457,"duration":7.06},{"text":"And on that occasion, there were about 20 or so students in attendance of whom the petitioner was one.","start":437.457,"stop":444.67,"duration":7.21},{"text":"And at this meeting, each of the students was asked to make a few preliminary background remarks about himself for the purpose of introducing himself to the rest of the group.","start":444.67,"stop":455.424,"duration":10.75},{"text":"And Kury stated that when it came, the petitioner's turn to introduce himself to the group, the petitioner stated to the group that he was the person who was in-charged of the ideological education of the group.","start":455.424,"stop":469.905,"duration":14.48},{"text":"Kury further states that the petitioner also said that he was a member of the Communist Party that he had joined the Communist Party in 1945 after Soviet troops had occupied Hungary and that he further told the rest of the members of the group that they should read certain Soviet books, should see Soviet films and discuss the news among themselves.","start":469.905,"stop":496.147,"duration":26.24},{"text":"He said that on this occasion, petitioner spoke for about five minutes, did not asked anybody to join the Party or just -- try to get anybody recruited into the Party.","start":496.147,"stop":507.48,"duration":11.33},{"text":"Now after the first meeting of this study group in September of 1948, Kury transferred out of this group to another group and never had any more dealings with the petitioner.","start":507.48,"stop":519.553,"duration":12.07},{"text":"So that this alleged statement of the petitioner or perhaps five minutes duration, made more than 16 years prior to the final hearing in the District Court was in fact the Court's sole basis for its finding that the petitioner had been a member of the Communist Party in Hungary.","start":519.553,"stop":540.838,"duration":21.28},{"text":"There was another Government witness, a Dr. Halasz.","start":540.838,"stop":545.571,"duration":4.73},{"text":"But Halasz's testimony turned up to be in fact more favorable to the petitioner than it was to the Government.","start":545.571,"stop":555.466,"duration":9.89},{"text":"Halasz entered medical school in 1949, three years after the petitioner, and had been friendly with him and as much they live in the same dormitory.","start":555.466,"stop":565.491,"duration":10.02},{"text":"And Halasz himself was admittedly a member of the Communist Party.","start":565.491,"stop":570.471,"duration":4.98},{"text":"He testified the Communist Party meetings were held of about once a month in the medical school and that he attended some but not all of them.","start":570.471,"stop":578.03,"duration":7.56},{"text":"At first, he testified that he saw the petitioner at perhaps two or three meetings but that -- I'm sorry -- at first, he testified that he saw the petitioner at several meetings in 1950 or '51.","start":578.03,"stop":593.058,"duration":15.03},{"text":"But when pressed, he stated that it might have been two or three meetings and perhaps maybe it was only meeting at which he saw the petitioner.","start":593.058,"stop":600.886,"duration":7.83},{"text":"He did not recall whether any of these meetings were open or closed.","start":600.886,"stop":606.398,"duration":5.51},{"text":"He stated that nonmembers of the Party were many times invited to attend such meetings and such invitation was tantamount to an order, that disobeyal of which subjected the person for severe penalties which might possibly include expulsion from the school.","start":606.398,"stop":622.44,"duration":16.04},{"text":"He also stated that nonmembers were not necessarily identified as such at these meetings.","start":622.44,"stop":630.528,"duration":8.09},{"text":"The petitioner in Halasz's words was a brilliant and outstanding medical student whom the communists would naturally have tried to indoctrinate in communism and would have invited therefore to attend these meetings.","start":630.528,"stop":646.56,"duration":16.03},{"text":"Halasz, the admitted member of the Party, never saw any membership card or membership book of the petitioner on any occasion, though on some occasions he was the doorkeeper in-charge of staying at the door, checking the credentials of people who came in.","start":646.56,"stop":663.904,"duration":17.34},{"text":"He never saw the petitioner pay any dues.","start":663.904,"stop":666.676,"duration":2.77},{"text":"He never saw the petitioner's name on any party list.","start":666.676,"stop":669.849,"duration":3.17},{"text":"He never observed the petitioner vote and he never saw or at least did not recall ever hearing the petitioner say anything at any such meeting.","start":669.849,"stop":680.11,"duration":10.26},{"text":"As a matter of fact, Halasz admitted in his testimony that he actually did not know whether the petitioner was or was not a member of the communist party, but that he had at one time made that assumption because of the fact that he had seen him at these meetings or meeting.","start":680.11,"stop":698.293,"duration":18.18},{"text":"But again he stated that he did not recall whether any such meeting was open or closed and that as a matter of fact, in the private conversations he had with the petitioner at that time and as much as they were close friends, he knew the petitioner to be quite anticommunist in his views.","start":698.293,"stop":721.476,"duration":23.18},{"text":"I would just like to point out that with respect to Kury's testimony, well Kury apparently could recite this incident of more than 16 years previously without too much difficulty.","start":721.476,"stop":738.067,"duration":16.59},{"text":"He could hardly remember anything else which transpired at this one meeting.","start":738.067,"stop":744.137,"duration":6.07},{"text":"He could not remember who the medical group leader of the studies was.","start":744.137,"stop":748.946,"duration":4.81},{"text":"He could not remember the name of any of the other students in the group.","start":748.946,"stop":752.881,"duration":3.93},{"text":"He could not admittedly remember the exact words that were used or allegedly used by the petitioner on this occasion.","start":752.881,"stop":760.353,"duration":7.47},{"text":"He had never made any notes or kept any diary with respect to it.","start":760.353,"stop":764.356,"duration":4},{"text":"And this meeting was conceitedly not a Communist Party meeting, this was a meeting of students for the purpose of discussing studies.","start":764.356,"stop":775.211,"duration":10.86},{"text":"Therefore, based upon solely the testimony of Kury, the District Court made its findings in which it seem to have embraced Kury's testimony to the exclusion of everything else.","start":775.211,"stop":791.06,"duration":15.85},{"text":"Because of the time situation, I am not going at length into the positive evidence educed in support of the petition for naturalization which I might say was quite substantial, but I am dealing with that aspect of the evidence which was damaging and which the court embraced in making its findings.","start":791.06,"stop":814.425,"duration":23.37},{"text":"The court didn't make the following findings, that the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party in 1945 or rather became a member of the Communist Party in 1945, the same year that Russian troops occupied the country.","start":814.425,"stop":829.923,"duration":15.5},{"text":"This last phrase is a verbatim quote from this finding.","start":829.923,"stop":835.257,"duration":5.33},{"text":"It indicates an adoption of Kury's language verbatim even though this witness did not profess to give the exact words that had been used by the petitioner on this occasion.","start":835.257,"stop":847.72,"duration":12.46},{"text":"The court next said that the petitioner remained a member of the Party for an indefinite number of years.","start":847.72,"stop":855.82,"duration":8.1},{"text":"Here, the District Court differed with the naturalization examiner's findings that the petitioner had been a member within the proscribe ten-year period was therefore currently ineligible under Section 313.","start":855.82,"stop":869.349,"duration":13.53},{"text":"But then as much as there was no testimony in the record to indicate any landfall of duration of membership, the court instead characterized the duration of the petitioner's membership and its finding of fact as an indefinite number of years.","start":869.349,"stop":884.271,"duration":14.92},{"text":"It then found that the petitioner attended closed meetings of the Party.","start":884.271,"stop":890.021,"duration":5.75},{"text":"On this, there was no testimony at all to justify this finding.","start":890.021,"stop":894.573,"duration":4.55},{"text":"The only witness who testified as to any meetings was Halasz.","start":894.573,"stop":898.607,"duration":4.03},{"text":"And his testimony was that he could not recall whether any meeting at which he saw the petitioner was open or closed.","start":898.607,"stop":905.825,"duration":7.22},{"text":"This seems to have been a gratuitous finding on the part of the court.","start":905.825,"stop":910.176,"duration":4.35},{"text":"The next finding that petitioner was in-charge of instruction in communist ideology at student study groups for an undetermined period of time.","start":910.176,"stop":922.51,"duration":12.33},{"text":"This again is based solely upon the alleged statement which Kury attributes to the petitioner.","start":922.51,"stop":930.375,"duration":7.87},{"text":"It was absolutely no independent evidence at all of the petitioner having engaged in any such activities as the statement allegedly -- as the finding allegedly describes or have often having engaged in any activities of the Communist Party, there is only the statement, the extrajudicial admission that is attributed to him by the witness Kury.","start":930.375,"stop":955.816,"duration":25.44},{"text":"Lastly, the Court found that the petitioner did not participate in the Hungarian revolt.","start":955.816,"stop":963.486,"duration":7.67},{"text":"He made this -- the District Court made this as an affirmative finding.","start":963.486,"stop":967.557,"duration":4.07},{"text":"Not only was there no evidence on this at all.","start":967.557,"stop":971.124,"duration":3.57},{"text":"But on the contrary, the only evidence with respect to this point was the petitioner's testimony in which he stated that is army unit fought against the Russians during the Hungarian uprising, and that during the revolt, he was continually on duty in the hospital treating the wounded.","start":971.124,"stop":989.186,"duration":18.06},{"text":"Based upon the finding of past Communist Party membership, the District Court there found that the petitioner had caused testified falsely and he was statutorily excluded from becoming naturalized -- statutory excluded from being a person of good moral character as would permit his naturalization.","start":989.186,"stop":1011.991,"duration":22.8},{"text":"Now, the Court of Appeals --","start":1011.991,"stop":1016.249,"duration":4.26}]},{"speakerName":"Earl
