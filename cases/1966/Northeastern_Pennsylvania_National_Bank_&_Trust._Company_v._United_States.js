valuation.","start":456.569,"stop":464.562,"duration":7.99},{"text":"The Government stresses that in this particular case have we used a capitalization approach we would have had a value in excess of the trust corpus.","start":464.562,"stop":474.125,"duration":9.56},{"text":"And we take the position that so long as the carving out process takes the lesser, whether it be the capitalization method

opinion.","start":556.344,"stop":576.768,"duration":20.42},{"text":"For example, the Third Circuit majority opinion took the position that there would be a fund dissolution if we used the annuity

testator said, “Out of income and corpus,” and then went on to say, “The principle remaining at the time of death,” which indicates to us that the testator could have contemplated dipping into the corpus, number one, but also a dissipation.","start":594.116,"stop":614.359,"duration":20.24},{"text":"Nextly, the Third Circuit opinion stresses the spendthrift trust clauses in the will and even the
