question.","start":215.51,"stop":219.569,"duration":4.06},{"text":"On pages three to four of the record, there is a clean abatement which attacks the composition of the grand jury.","start":219.569,"stop":227.741,"duration":8.17},{"text":"It alleges that there has been over period of years systematic exclusion of Negroes, that the grand jury is selected from the tax digest that many Negroes' names appear on the tax digest and many Negroes in the community are upright and intelligent citizens, that over period of 10 years, virtually no Negroes have served on the grand jury, that there has been none as jury commissioners are and that the tax digest are kept on basis of race indicating who's colored and who's white in the very book which is the source of the grand jurors.","start":227.741,"stop":262.5,"duration":34.76},{"text":"The clean abatement also alleged that there was neither notice nor reasonable opportunity to petitioner to challenge the array of the grand jury prior to the time of the return of the indictment which took petitioner by surprise.","start":262.5,"stop":277.218,"duration":14.72},{"text":"Petitioner supposed that he was going to be try

system of selection whereby Negroes who excluded and included on the basis of race and that Negroes selected Negroes who might have served down traverse jury was systematically struck from service on the basis of race and then there were some additional charges which similar to those made in connection with the grand jury.","start":289.122,"stop":320.606,"duration":31.48},{"text":"Now, petitioner will not elaborate on what the law is that governs the jury question because it is familiar to this Court and has been argued at least several times each term but in the phrase, it is that a defendant is not entitled to members of his own race, on a panel or on a jury which tries him.","start":320.606,"stop":345.937,"duration":25.33},{"text":"He's merely entitled not to have them systematically excluded and the way this issue has been tried in case after case has been to look at the history and see what has been the method of selection of the jury, what have been the results and what kind of a judgment can you make from these facts and that would be particularly appropriate in this case because even though petitioners was re-indicted a day before his trial but there was no evidence whatsoever that the method of selection on the new indictment is any different from the method of selection that has been used over all the years in the past and indeed to extent of the record indicates it, it is the same method of selection and does rely upon the tax digest which are divided on the basis of race and white person's name or in white pages and Negro person's name are on yellow pages.","start":345.937,"stop":400.522,"duration":54.58}]},{"speakerName":"UNKNOWN","textObjs":[{"text":"(Inaudible)","start":400.522,"stop":402.39,"duration":1.87}]},{"speakerName":"Jack

certified register of the jury list of the previous 10 years and this was the very first thing that he did.","start":453.735,"stop":466.727,"duration":12.99},{"text":"And this obviously was a prelude

cases.","start":471.912,"stop":475.573,"duration":3.66},{"text":"In page 50 of our brief, we cite perhaps the half page full of citations of cases in which this and other courts have looked to the

jury.”","start":487.511,"stop":505.028,"duration":17.52},{"text":"And the Court said, “I am the opinion that would be right.”","start":505.028,"stop":509.719,"duration":4.69},{"text":"The objections were sustained and so as to leave no doubt whatsoever about the grounds of sustaining them, the grounds of the ruling on the State Supreme Court, we find on page 331 of the record in the opinion of the Supreme Court of the state, we are of the opinion that the Court properly excluded jury lists for prior years.","start":509.719,"stop":529.708,"duration":19.99},{"text":"They would not be relevant in the face of a showing that no discrimination existed in the composition of the present juries.","start":529.708,"stop":536.789,"duration":7.08},{"text":"So, the holding below and both the trial and the appellate courts were that petitioner would not be permitte to demonstrate what the pattern of selection had been over the past leading-up into the present.","start":536.789,"stop":549.87,"duration":13.08},{"text":"And we submit that on this ground alone and we will discussed the method of selection, the yellow and white pages in a moment but in this ground of alone on the basis of this Court's decision in Carter against Texas and the decision of a term or two go in Coleman against Alabama that is reversible error in and of itself for this petitioner at a minimum has a right to prove his case and his case consists of demonstrating what the method of selection is and what kind of juries this method produces and he wasn't permitted to do that.","start":549.87,"stop":581.333,"duration":31.46},{"text":"Now, on this grand jury, we do know that if the grand jury that indicted petitioner, there was a stipulation that there was a single Negro and we do know that on the petty jury array of 99, there were five Negroes and if we put together the names of the Negroes alongside the list of strikes which appear on page 19 to 21 of the record, we also know that three Negroes were struck by the state and two Negroes were never reached, so all five Negroes were disposed of.","start":581.333,"stop":615.738,"duration":34.41},{"text":"Now, we submit that if we could demonstrate -- forbidden to demonstrate, if this have been the pattern of the past 10 years or less over period of many years at all that there have been no more representation in this, so perhaps less representation on this, there would be clear grounds reversal but petitioner was never permitted to show anything about the previous years and all we have is the -- this bid of evidence about the single year which in and on of itself is a suspicious to the point of I think indicating to a certainty

method of selection is infected with racial consideration.","start":817.649,"stop":826.195,"duration":8.55},{"text":"This Court has held in Hamm against Virginia that the maintenance of tax list on these basis, there is no jury question involved in that case but the maintenance of tax list on this basis violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and a case that is very much in point we submit is Anderson against Morton, the Louisiana case which said that it was unconstitutional to place the race of a candidate next to his name on a ballot and the reason that is unconstitutional is that at the last moment before the voter makes his choice the state thrust under his nose the racial consideration.","start":826.195,"stop":865.489,"duration":39.29},{"text":"It's the only thing that the state tells him at that point and the Court held that this was impermissible combination of private and public action that while you could not stop voters from knowing what the race of the candidates would be and in fact in most cases they would be expected to know and no way certainly couldn't read their minds, you know why they voted for candidates in some instances they might vote for him on a basis of race or might vote against him on a basis race.","start":865.489,"stop":890.928,"duration":25.44},{"text":"Nevertheless, for the states to inject the racial

pointed out, that it might have been possible peek into the box but nobody did know that anyone actually had peeked into it but the opportunity for discrimination which the use of yellow and white

Amendment.","start":981.621,"stop":1006.934,"duration":25.31},{"text":"We submit that this case is even stronger than Avery against Georgia because we do know that the jury commissioners in selecting
