observations by way of circular letters to people in this country and by illustrated lectures.","start":96.142,"stop":108.009,"duration":11.87},{"text":"And I assume from the decisions in (Inaudible) that this Court is familiar with the statutory editing in Section 1185 and I will not go into that detail unless I'm asked to sufficing to say that 1185 replaced two earlier statutes which in pertinent respects here were identical.","start":108.009,"stop":129.336,"duration":21.33},{"text":"There were prior to the 1952 enactment of Section 1185 regulations issued by the Secretary of State and which were adopted by the President after the 1952 statute passed in Proclamation Number 3004 which is set forth on our -- in the appendix to our brief, Appendix F.","start":129.336,"stop":157.5,"duration":28.16},{"text":"And these regulations provided that passports would not be required for countries in the western hemisphere.","start":157.5,"stop":168.069,"duration":10.57},{"text":"In 1961, the so-called excluding Cuba Amendment was adopted, and this as we see it is a three faceted Government Act which involved a regulation, a public notice and a press release.","start":168.069,"stop":186.558,"duration":18.49},{"text":"The regulation is set forth at Appendix B of our brief.","start":186.558,"stop":190.618,"duration":4.06},{"text":"It states in terms that it is promulgated under an executive order which in turn was based upon 22 U.S.C.211 (a) is the statute

1185.","start":203.157,"stop":208.825,"duration":5.67},{"text":"And the effect of it was to exclude Cuba from the exemption in the earlier regulations pertaining to countries in the western hemisphere.","start":208.825,"stop":217.341,"duration":8.52},{"text":"So that by the face of the regulation alone, taking it by itself, a passport was required in the case of a departure for Cuba just as it were had been required for a departure for France, or Burma, or Cuba and whatever.","start":217.341,"stop":234.578,"duration":17.24},{"text":"There was nothing in the regulation on itself which required a special endorsement to the passport for Cuba.","start":234.578,"stop":243.9,"duration":9.32},{"text":"Simultaneously, with the promulgation of the amendment was the issuance of the public notice that is set forth in Appendix D to our brief, which declared existing passports invalid for Cuba and provided for the future that passports not be valid for travel to Cuba unless especially endorsed for such travel.","start":243.9,"stop":267.528,"duration":23.63},{"text":"The third process of the Government Act at this time was the simultaneous press relief, which explained the Government's action is the result of the Government's inability and I quote, \"to extend a normal protective servicing to Americans traveling in -- or visiting in Cuba.\"","start":267.528,"stop":288.209,"duration":20.68},{"text":"It advised that the specially required endorsement for passports to Cuba would be granted only to persons, \"Whose travel maybe regarded as in the best interest of the United States.\"","start":288.209,"stop":304.144,"duration":15.94},{"text":"We take the position in this litigation, if the Court please that the regulations, the public notice and the press release are an integrated scheme to regulate travel by -- to Cuba by way of license to be issued in a total discretion of the Secretary of State.","start":304.144,"stop":326.463,"duration":22.32},{"text":"Now, I would like to address myself to our first position namely that the statute does not authorize the imposition of criminal sanctions to enforce area travel ban.","start":326.463,"stop":341.821,"duration":15.36},{"text":"On its face of the statute and I now refer to Section 1185, imposes a requirement that citizens hold a valid passports at the time they cross U.S. borders and that is as far as the statute goes.","start":341.821,"stop":358.534,"duration":16.71},{"text":"The face of the statute contains no reference to the destination of it's -- of the traveler and imposes no requirement and no sanctions related to the destination of the traveler.","start":358.534,"stop":373.683,"duration":15.15},{"text":"As applied here, the Government would read the statute as permitting the use of a passport requirement with a purpose of prohibiting travel to areas declared out of bounds by the Government.","start":373.683,"stop":387.351,"duration":13.67},{"text":"And the issue as we see it is whether the statute is to be construed as we think it is written, simply a border control regulation or whether is it be construed as we think the Government would construe it as a travel to regulation, which imposes prohibitions and licenses and dependent upon the destination of the traveler.","start":387.351,"stop":416.403,"duration":29.05},{"text":"Our position rests on three grounds if the Court please.","start":416.403,"stop":421.343,"duration":4.94},{"text":"First on the face of the statute which is I've already pointed out, speaks only to holding a passport when the border is crossed and without any reference to destination at all.","start":421.343,"stop":435.111,"duration":13.77},{"text":"The second point of our position here is that the legislative history of the statute discloses a purpose to impose surveillance and control over border crossing specifically and articulately directed to security consideration such as spies, saboteurs and fugitives in justice.","start":435.111,"stop":457.963,"duration":22.85},{"text":"And as our legislative history shows, the sponsor of the legislation as one of it -- the other three stages at which it was enacted specifically said that it was not directed and I quote again, \"it's the legitimate travel of United States citizen.\"","start":457.963,"stop":475.161,"duration":17.2},{"text":"The third ground of our position here is that the history of area restrictions as developed by administrative interpretation and application shows that these restrictions has been consistently regarded as unrelated to the command of Section 1185 as not armed if you will by the sanctions of Section 1185.","start":475.161,"stop":499.788,"duration":24.63},{"text":"I said consistently, consistently that is until after and I repeat, after the Excluding Cuba regulations was adopted.","start":499.788,"stop":511.17,"duration":11.38},{"text":"Now, it appears in the Government's brief that it concedes our position concerning the face of the statute and it concedes our position concerning the legislative history and I do not discuss this here unless the Court have direct questions to me about that.","start":511.17,"stop":526.504,"duration":15.33},{"text":"As I read the Government's brief, it fact -- in fact, it does not deny the facts that we present on administrative construction, although, it would draw from different inferences from it.","start":526.504,"stop":540.912,"duration":14.41},{"text":"Concerning administrative construction, I think it's important to observe the dual function of a passport is delineated by this Court in Kent against Dulles.","start":540.912,"stop":550.319,"duration":9.41},{"text":"There, the court spoke first the function of the passport as a request directed to foreign government for the safe passage of the traveler and secondly, as a means of exit control.","start":550.319,"stop":564.859,"duration":14.54},{"text":"We think that the history of area restrictions developed by the administrative action of the Department of State has always and explicitly acted with reference to the request for safe passage function alone.","start":564.859,"stop":580.901,"duration":16.04},{"text":"Without going into the details of the administrative construction which is set out in our brief, let me summarize it briefly if I may in this way.","start":580.901,"stop":590.961,"duration":10.06},{"text":"We have presented there all area restrictions which are researched to disclose which were adopted by the department at the time when Section 1185 or one of its identical predecessors was in effect.","start":590.961,"stop":607.701,"duration":16.74},{"text":"And none of those instances invokes or is related in any way or warns about the sanctions of 1185.","start":607.701,"stop":620.325,"duration":12.62},{"text":"They are all accounts in request for safe passage terms.","start":620.325,"stop":625.224,"duration":4.9},{"text":"There is no reference to or warning about a criminal penalty.","start":625.224,"stop":629.875,"duration":4.65},{"text":"And this if the Court please, this includes three such instances which occurred after the enactment of the current legislation.","start":629.875,"stop":640.877,"duration":11},{"text":"And I would draw your attention particularly -- although, certainly not exclusively to the 1918 instance which is discussed in our brief, because the Government pays so much attention to what it was doing at the time the original 1918 statute was passed.","start":640.877,"stop":659.97,"duration":19.09},{"text":"Where the Government had to practice at that time, the department had to practice at that time, of saying where -- to what areas the passport was good for but they -- and one of the areas where it was suppose to be not good was Germany at that time.","start":659.97,"stop":678.786,"duration":18.82},{"text":"But the Department's explanatory statement said that this doesn't mean that the traveler couldn't go to Germany, it meant that he had to go there on his own responsibility and at his own risk.","start":678.786,"stop":690.763,"duration":11.98},{"text":"And then as consistently thereafter, the Government was talking not in terms of a prohibition enforced by criminal sanction but in terms of requesting safe passage.","start":690.763,"stop":704.189,"duration":13.43},{"text":"Now two instances, both of them after the current statute was passed, require a little more attention.","start":704.189,"stop":712.107,"duration":7.92},{"text":"In 1952, the Department of State passed a so-called ban on travel to communist countries.","start":712.107,"stop":720.835,"duration":8.73},{"text":"It declared that these passports would not be validated for a certain named communist countries.","start":720.835,"stop":727.283,"duration":6.45},{"text":"In its explanatory statement at that time, it is said that the Department emphasizes, this is its own words that this action in no way forbid that also as it claims, travel to these countries.","start":727.283,"stop":743.03,"duration":15.75},{"text":"It said that it contemplated that the traveler would inquire of the Government what conditions were in the countries to which he intended to go and if the normal protective or satisfactory protective arrangements existed the travel would be authorized.","start":743.03,"stop":763.927,"duration":20.9},{"text":"We say, if the Court please, that this is in effect a disclaimer that the court -- the -- that area restrictions were being issued with criminal sanctions to enforce them.","start":763.927,"stop":776.486,"duration":12.56},{"text":"And indeed, so did the Association of the Bar of the City of New York which termed it an honest admission that the Department lacked criminal powers to enforce area restrictions.","start":776.486,"stop":789.286,"duration":12.8},{"text":"More clear and more explicit by way of disclaimer of criminal sanction is the 1957 incident referred to in our brief where the able chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee directed this question to the Department.","start":789.286,"stop":804.349,"duration":15.06},{"text":"What does it mean?","start":804.349,"stop":805.166,"duration":0.82},{"text":"He said.","start":805.166,"stop":806.617,"duration":1.45},{"text":"If a passport is stamped not valid for travel to country X and the holder of the passport goes to country X.","start":806.617,"stop":814.085,"duration":7.47},{"text":"Is he violating the criminal law?","start":814.085,"stop":816.939,"duration":2.85},{"text":"And the Department asked for a time to study that question and it took two months to study it and then submitted a written reply in which it said, not necessarily.","start":816.939,"stop":827.059,"duration":10.12},{"text":"And then went on to illustrate its meaning by saying that peripheral to the travel itself, there might be criminal risks for the traveler because if he went to such a country, currency exchanges might involve even trading with the Enemy Act Violation.","start":827.059,"stop":841.805,"duration":14.75},{"text":"Or he might not be able to get a passport in the future or he might be involved in false statement accusations growing out of his application for the passport that he was using.","start":841.805,"stop":852.055,"duration":10.25},{"text":"But nowhere, the Court please, nowhere did the court say that kind of travel would violate Section 1185.","start":852.055,"stop":859.273,"duration":7.22}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.
