Justice and by Justice Fortas as to whether or not the provision which we are challenging that we challenged below, Section 26 of the California Constitution, includes or encompasses persons who determine to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing because of race based upon agreement with others, particularly agreements in the nature of restrictive covenants.","start":14.246,"stop":51.437,"duration":37.19},{"text":"My answer to the question of Your Honors is different from that given to you by Mr. Pruitt.","start":51.437,"stop":57.556,"duration":6.12},{"text":"The text of Section 26 appears as an appendix to the brief for the petitioners as do the valid arguments which were submitted to the voters in California.","start":57.556,"stop":72.191,"duration":14.64},{"text":"The first sheet or page in the appendix, right after the blue sheet from the brief for the petitioners contains the text of Section 26.","start":72.191,"stop":83.597,"duration":11.41},{"text":"Your Honors will find that the brief for the petitioners and the brief for respondents may carry the similar colors but they're quite different in thrust and in import so far as the arguments presented are concerned.","start":83.597,"stop":95.413,"duration":11.82},{"text":"This is called brief for petitioners and it has an appendix following a little blue sheet and the critical or significant provisions of this -- of this entire section is in the first paragraph and I merely refer to the last sentence in the first paragraph and to the phrase, “In his absolute discretion.”","start":95.413,"stop":121.493,"duration":26.08},{"text":"And it seems to me that a reading of that phrase stated as broadly as I think the

appendix.","start":232.249,"stop":240.86,"duration":8.61},{"text":"Your Honors will find nothing in the valid -- valid arguments which suggest any such exemption for persons who determine to discriminate in their absolute discretion based upon such agreements.","start":240.86,"stop":252.843,"duration":11.98},{"text":"And finally as to this narrow point, narrow or broad, in addition to the
