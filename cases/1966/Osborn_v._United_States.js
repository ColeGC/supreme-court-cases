argument.","start":8.096,"stop":10.997,"duration":2.9}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.","start":10.997,"stop":14.948,"duration":3.95},{"text":"In concluding my argument on the entrapment issue, I would only like to draw the Court's attention to several particular circumstances arising out of the record in this case which strongly support the jury's conclusion of no entrapment in light of all the evidence including petitioner's own testimony.","start":14.948,"stop":34.947,"duration":20},{"text":"And they are first that in passing on the entrapment claim, the jury was certainly entitled to consider who it is, who was alleged to have been entrapping whom, a policeman of less than one year's experience allegedly entrapping in three or five or six meetings according to petitioner, an attorney of more than 20 years standing.","start":34.947,"stop":56.09,"duration":21.14},{"text":"And this is a defense which the jury was certainly entitled to view with skepticism in light of the kind of case that was involved or in light of the charges as to which the petitioner was defending in the forthcoming trial which for themselves obstruction of justice charges or attempts to bribe jurors.","start":56.09,"stop":80.334,"duration":24.24},{"text":"It's hard to be likely that an attorney in those circumstances would be readily and even half a dozen meetings entrapped into making this kind of an offer.","start":80.334,"stop":94.116,"duration":13.78},{"text":"In addition, it appears quite clear from petitioner's own testimony that he was the one who was instructing, on the very fine details of jury bribery.","start":94.116,"stop":106.32,"duration":12.2},{"text":"According to his own testimony, by the third or fourth meeting he was advising Vick that the way to bribe a juror was to pay half down and half later or that the best way to find out whether prospective juror would take to be bribed would be to ask him he wanted and then double the amount.","start":106.32,"stop":124.539,"duration":18.22},{"text":"And that appears from petitioner's own testimony.","start":124.539,"stop":127.065,"duration":2.53},{"text":"And then the final and conclusive bit of evidence which the Court of Appeals found very persuasive which I think the jury certainly was entitled to find almost conclusive was the reading of the transcript of November 11 that which appears at pages 5 through 8 of our brief.","start":127.065,"stop":144.108,"duration":17.04},{"text":"The -- merely reading of that transcript, we believe, discloses makes it entirely clear in the dealings between petitioner and Vick, exactly who it is, who was the Svengali and who it is who was Trilby.","start":144.108,"stop":157.514,"duration":13.41},{"text":"It's quite clear from that conversation that Vick was reporting to his master and asking his advice as to what steps to take next.","start":157.514,"stop":166.939,"duration":9.42},{"text":"In light of all that evidence, of course, we are not contending that there was no evidence to go to the jury but in light of all that proof, our burden is certainly satisfied sufficiently to warrant the submission of the issue of entrapment to the jury under proper instructions and that's what we've done in this case.","start":166.939,"stop":189.302,"duration":22.36},{"text":"Let me now turn to the petitioner's subsidiary challenge on the entrapment issue which is the rebuttal testimony introduced in answer to the entrapment claim was improper.","start":189.302,"stop":200.621,"duration":11.32},{"text":"Petitioner focuses on the two bits of rebuttal testimony which are the affidavit of Vick in which he related according to his story the conversation that he had with petitioner on November 7 which was, according to Vick, the very first time that he ever mentioned to petitioner that his cousin was on the jury and the judges testimony that they had authorized that recording.","start":200.621,"stop":225.684,"duration":25.06},{"text":"Now I think it's important, just preliminarily, that to make clear that the judges in no way testified that they believed that petitioner was guilty of attempting to bribe the juror.","start":225.684,"stop":239.224,"duration":13.54},{"text":"Their testimony was very severely limited.","start":239.224,"stop":242.633,"duration":3.41},{"text":"The Government did not attempt to introduce any opinion, evidence of their part to guilt or innocence of the defendant in any way.","start":242.633,"stop":249.455,"duration":6.82},{"text":"They testified merely as to what was done on November 8: that the Government prosecutors came to them, advice them that they had an affidavit from a man who said that petitioner was attempting to bribe the juror and that the Government didn't know what do to in those circumstances and that the prosecutors themselves could not, in light of the petitioner's good reputation, in light of petitioners standing in the national bar did not know whether to credit the story.","start":249.455,"stop":278.997,"duration":29.54},{"text":"When the judges testified that having read the Affidavit, they authorized the prosecutors to send Vick back in with a tape recording.","start":278.997,"stop":290.116,"duration":11.12},{"text":"Now, the judges' testimony was

Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"The reason, Mr. Justice Harlan was really because the prosecutors realized that this was a matter going into the integrity of justice in the Middle District of Tennessee.","start":295.168,"stop":305.984,"duration":10.82},{"text":"If the Government had been seeking merely the equivalent of a search warrant, and that was also part of our purpose in court, but if they'd been seeking merely the equivalent of the search warrant, then of course, it would have been adequate to go to one judge or to a commissioner.","start":305.984,"stop":317.51,"duration":11.53},{"text":"But since this was a matter which went - - both because it involve an officer of the court and because it involve charges of jury entrapping, it went to the integrity of justice, of the administration of justice in that court, the Government felt it was appropriate to bring it to the attention of the - - and affect the whole Court in the Middle District of Tennessee which was both Federal District judges.","start":317.51,"stop":340.468,"duration":22.96}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Didn't they both have a jury panel that might be used in the case to it?","start":340.468,"stop":345.007,"duration":4.54}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, they both had.","start":345.007,"stop":345.955,"duration":0.95},{"text":"Well, the jury panel would have been Judge, as an initial matter, the case was assigned to Judge Gray in the Middle District of Tennessee because Judge Miller had refused himself.","start":345.955,"stop":354.668,"duration":8.71},{"text":"But there was a possibility that if Judge Gray's panel had been exhausted, that the jury panel in Judge Miller's courtroom would be called upon to serve on Judge Gray.","start":354.668,"stop":366.826,"duration":12.16},{"text":"So that they work to that extent, both interested because they both had jury panel which might serve on that trial.","start":366.826,"stop":372.406,"duration":5.58},{"text":"But I think the main reason why it's just that the Government felt that this was something which the entire Court of the Middle District of Tennessee should have before it, before the Government took further steps to determine whether the allegations were true or not.","start":372.406,"stop":388.564,"duration":16.16}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Lewin, would it disrupt your argument to state to us just briefly how, just how this testimony came into the case?","start":388.564,"stop":398.424,"duration":9.86}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"The judges' testimony?","start":398.424,"stop":399.479,"duration":1.06}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, yes.","start":399.479,"stop":400.605,"duration":1.13}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, at the conclusion of the defendant's evidence and the defendant had presented evidence in which he attempted, the petitioner attempted to show that this was all Vick's discussions with him were all part of entrapment scheme and plot on the Government to get him, to ensnare him into making this statement.","start":400.605,"stop":423.557,"duration":22.95},{"text":"The Government then in rebuttal, at the conclusion on defendant's evidence put on Judge, first Judge Gray to testify and then Judge Miller to testify to the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of the recording.","start":423.557,"stop":438.939,"duration":15.38},{"text":"We feel that this was perfectly proper rebuttal evidence really for three reasons, because it went to three issues which we think were raised by petitioner's own testimony, by petitioner's own defense which we could not, which the Government could not have anticipated as part of his direct case but which is, which was perfectly proper to rebut as part of, of course in Government's rebuttal.","start":438.939,"stop":460.244,"duration":21.31},{"text":"And those three --","start":460.244,"stop":460.977,"duration":0.73}]},{"speakerName":"Earl Warren","textObjs":[{"text":"And at that same time, bring him the tape recording?","start":460.977,"stop":466.373,"duration":5.4}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"No, Mr. Chief Justice.","start":466.373,"stop":467.317,"duration":0.94},{"text":"The tape recording, as part of the Government's original case, Vick testified and he just merely testified that he had a discussion with petitioner on November 7; that thereafter, he was equipped with the tape recorder and had another discussion with petitioner on November 8 when apparently the tape recorder did not work.","start":467.317,"stop":489.321,"duration":22},{"text":"And that he was again equipped with the tape recorder on November 11 and the tape recording then did work.","start":489.321,"stop":494.508,"duration":5.19},{"text":"He then identified the tape and the FBI agents identified the tape and the tape recording was put into evidence as part of the Government's original case to corroborate the testimony of Vick as to his discussions with the petitioner.","start":494.508,"stop":509.511,"duration":15},{"text":"Now, petitioner in his case, in his defense testified that this whole course of conduct, Vick's discussions with him were part of a government plot intended to ensnare him into making statements and into offering a bribe to a juror.","start":509.511,"stop":525.825,"duration":16.31},{"text":"And, it was petitioner's version that Vick first began mentioning his relationship to the juror on October 28 when he was retained by petitioner and that Vick then returned on the following day.","start":525.825,"stop":540.774,"duration":14.95},{"text":"And again, three or four days later and suggested that each time that he would first, the first time that he would speak with his cousin and on the third visit that he had spoken with his cousin and that his cousin is willing to accept the bribe.","start":540.774,"stop":555.589,"duration":14.82},{"text":"Now, of course, petitioner's own testimony admitted that he met the suggestion only -- responded to the suggestion only weakly and didn't really offer any resistance that by the third meeting he was instructing Vick on exactly how to go about bribing the juror.","start":555.589,"stop":573.24,"duration":17.65},{"text":"But nonetheless, there was presented to the jury as a conclusion of the defendant's case, a clear dispute in the testimony as to the conduct of the Vick between October 28 and November 7, which was date when Vick claim that he first had a discussion with petitioner about his cousin being on the jury.","start":573.24,"stop":596.147,"duration":22.91},{"text":"Now, the judges' rebuttal testimony and the Affidavit of Vick, we think, went to three factual issues that was then properly before the jury.","start":596.147,"stop":605.387,"duration":9.24},{"text":"One was the question of whether the recording itself which petitioner's counsel attacked -- we refer to the various times in petitioner's own examination is that thing on Vick's bag and implying to the jury that this was part of a devious course of conduct by the Government to have worked, the petitioner up to his stay where he would be making a statement into recording device that that recording was unauthorized, unlawful part of an unlawful scheme by the Government.","start":605.387,"stop":643.355,"duration":37.97},{"text":"We think that it was appropriate to put on the judges to testify that the Government had come to them.","start":643.355,"stop":649.209,"duration":5.85},{"text":"Government prosecutors had come to the judges in their dilemma to seek authorization for that, that kind of investigative step; that the jury would, otherwise, have had the reason to believe that the Government was acting improperly.","start":649.209,"stop":666.695,"duration":17.49},{"text":"Now it's true that in passing, in reading petitioner's own admissions to the judges in the disbarment proceeding, what was also read to the jury was the fact that Judge Gray had then said in the course of the disbarment proceeding, that he had authorized the recording.","start":666.695,"stop":683.247,"duration":16.55},{"text":"But that did not put before the jury in any way other than hearsay the fact that the judges had authorized him.","start":683.247,"stop":691.756,"duration":8.51},{"text":"Those transcripts were introduced simply to establish petitioner's own admissions, his own statements in the disbarment proceeding.","start":691.756,"stop":698.443,"duration":6.69},{"text":"And what the judges said at that time, and merely the transcript was being read to the jury.","start":698.443,"stop":702.663,"duration":4.22},{"text":"What the judges said at that time was context for petitioner's own admissions.","start":702.663,"stop":707.707,"duration":5.04}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Did petitioner's counsel at the trial attack the truth of the recording, the liability of what is on the recording?","start":707.707,"stop":717.828,"duration":10.12}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"No, petitioner himself, Mr. Justice Fortas, admitted that the recording was accurate.","start":717.828,"stop":722.673,"duration":4.85}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, then what was for the jury to decide with respect to the recording in jury?","start":722.673,"stop":728.521,"duration":5.85},{"text":"Who has then had the function of deciding whether it was lawful?","start":728.521,"stop":734.655,"duration":6.13}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"No, but the jury had the function of passing, Mr. Justice Fortas on the entrapment claim and on the claim that was all a devious plot by the Government.","start":734.655,"stop":741.997,"duration":7.34},{"text":"This was really the (Voice Overlap).","start":741.997,"stop":742.692,"duration":0.7}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, what difference does it make on entrapment whether the judges did or there did not authorize the recording?","start":742.692,"stop":749.629,"duration":6.94}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, because the elements of entrapment are both --","start":749.629,"stop":751.879,"duration":2.25}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"I know what the elements of entrapment are but what was a -- what difference does it make whether the judges authorized the recording or whether Vick just went there entrap or didn't entrap Osborn and then testified?","start":751.879,"stop":767.6,"duration":15.72}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, the Government's conduct whether we, we think properly that the jury was able to consider how fair, how devious the Government's conduct may have been in all these meetings between Vick and petitioner.","start":767.6,"stop":783.598,"duration":16}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"It's getting pretty close to saying that what the Government was after was to get a manual of the judiciary around the use of a tape recorder in the entire incident and you don't mean that.","start":783.598,"stop":799.903,"duration":16.31},{"text":"Is that your position?","start":799.903,"stop":801.282,"duration":1.38}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"No.","start":801.282,"stop":801.695,"duration":0.41},{"text":"Well, our position is that, the Government, when it did equip Vick with a tape recorder, was in a dilemma as to what an appropriate investigative step would be --","start":801.695,"stop":813.376,"duration":11.68}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"I'm not asking about that at the moment.","start":813.376,"stop":815.632,"duration":2.26},{"text":"What I'm asking about is, what was the reason for putting two federal district judges on the witness stand in a criminal trial?","start":815.632,"stop":826.581,"duration":10.95},{"text":"Now, did it have an evidentiary reason or was it merely an effort by the Government to lend weight, believability and force to its case.","start":826.581,"stop":839.833,"duration":13.25},{"text":"I think that's the issue that is presented here.","start":839.833,"stop":843.767,"duration":3.93}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Right, we think it had an evidentiary reason for -- really for almost three separate reasons.","start":843.767,"stop":849.041,"duration":5.27},{"text":"We think one, it had an evidentiary reason because it was proper for the jury to consider whether in the course of dealings between petitioner and Vick, the Government had engaged in unlawful activity.","start":849.041,"stop":863.082,"duration":14.04},{"text":"That enters as well into a jury determination of entrapment that this Court has in its entrapment cases called attention of the fact that when the Government uses improper persuasion, improper techniques in its dealings with the suspect, then that may very well be part of a determination as to whether the called course of conduct in such that the conviction should be invalidated.","start":863.082,"stop":892.469,"duration":29.39}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Apart from the question on the lawfulness of the use of the recorder, propriety or impropriety is to be determined from the facts and circumstances.","start":892.469,"stop":905.077,"duration":12.61},{"text":"Propriety and impropriety are not perhaps, may I suggest this to you, establish by the fact that two Federal judges took the witness stand or even the two federal judges authorized the use of the recorder.","start":905.077,"stop":923.968,"duration":18.89},{"text":"I mean, the use of the recorder is either proper or improper.","start":923.968,"stop":928.026,"duration":4.06},{"text":"That's apart from the question of the validity of its authorization or lack of authorization.","start":928.026,"stop":936.398,"duration":8.37}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"But we think propriety or impropriety is established to the extent that it shows that the Government was not intending to use the recording unless it had received the authorization of the District judges.","start":936.398,"stop":946.945,"duration":10.55},{"text":"In other words, not merely the authorization but just the fact that the Government was not going out on its own to use any kind of investigative method that it could think of.","start":946.945,"stop":957.943,"duration":11},{"text":"In addition, though, Mr. Justice Fortas, we think there are other reasons, other evidentiary reasons for the judges' testimony.","start":957.943,"stop":964.643,"duration":6.7},{"text":"One of the very critical issues of fact before the jury was or I can't say it's critical because our view that even in the petitioner's testimony, there was no entrapment for the jury could have found out.","start":964.643,"stop":978.131,"duration":13.49},{"text":"But one of the very important issues was, was Vick suggesting to the petitioner before November 7 that he would speak to his cousin?","start":978.131,"stop":985.968,"duration":7.84},{"text":"Vick's testimony was that between October 28 and November 7, he didn't know such thing.","start":985.968,"stop":990.956,"duration":4.99},{"text":"Now, the fact that on November 8, the Government came before the judges and submitted to the judges in the Middle District of Tennessee an affidavit by Vick, which contain nothing more than a relation of one conversation, a conversation of a day or before.","start":990.956,"stop":1006.526,"duration":15.57},{"text":"We think did bear on the issue whether there had been a whole series of conversation as private.","start":1006.526,"stop":1012.707,"duration":6.18},{"text":"If petitioner was telling the truth as to that whole series of dealings, the Government would have had much more by November 8 than merely one conversation by Vick with petitioner.","start":1012.707,"stop":1026.664,"duration":13.96},{"text":"So that the circumstances of the affidavit, and let me say the affidavit was something which the Government wanted to introduce in its case in chief but to which the petitioner objected at that time because Vick was already off the stand and the judge said, “Well, you can only introduce it if you put Vick back on to the stand to identify it.”","start":1026.664,"stop":1044.857,"duration":18.19},{"text":"So, if the affidavit was going to be included and that, we think, did rebut the claim that there had been a series of discussions prior to that, but if the affidavit was going to be put in then the judge had to be put on to identify that affidavit and to say yes on the basis of that affidavit which was presented to mean under circumstances under which it was presented to him.","start":1044.857,"stop":1063.483,"duration":18.63},{"text":"He, I think, did some official

jury.","start":1069.967,"stop":1072.888,"duration":2.92},{"text":"There was a critical factual issue from the point of view of the prosecutors because petitioner's testimony, of course, tried to bring

juror.","start":1072.888,"stop":1091.891,"duration":19},{"text":"So, on the issue of dates, on the issue on what was happening between October 28 and November 7, we think that that testimony of the

intertwine with the second and that is, that we think it's perfectly proper in any entrapment case to bring before the jury the entire course of the Government's conduct.","start":1174.837,"stop":1190.908,"duration":16.07},{"text":"In other words, if a government agency is accused by the defendant as part of his defense of entrapping him, then we think the jury is entitled to know exactly what steps the Government has taken in that series of dealings with the defendant.","start":1190.908,"stop":1206.669,"duration":15.76},{"text":"And what the Government did before Vick went in the second time to speak to petitioner and before Vick went in the third time to speak with petitioner is we think an appropriate consideration to the jury, the jury ought to be have before it in such a determination the entire course of the Government's conduct from beginning to end.","start":1206.669,"stop":1226.212,"duration":19.54},{"text":"And really, petitioner's
