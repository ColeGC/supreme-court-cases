Stated District Court in and for the District of Colorado.","start":33.595,"stop":41.576,"duration":7.98},{"text":"There are three questions presented to this Court.","start":41.576,"stop":44.26,"duration":2.68},{"text":"No. 1 is whether the District Court had jurisdiction over the parties in the subject matter to this action; the second question is whether the American National Red Cross is an instrumentality or agency, and I use the words interchangeably, of the United States Government; and the third question is if the Court finds that the American National Red Cross is an agency of the United States Government, has Congress waived its immunity from taxation by its 1960 Amendments to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act which became effective, January 1962.","start":44.26,"stop":85.385,"duration":41.13},{"text":"This action arose, and I go on way of background, that because of the proviso of the Amendment to the Colorado Employment Security Act which is set forth in Chapter 82, 1963 CRS (Colorado Revised Statutes) which taxes all non-profit organizations in the State of Colorado.","start":85.385,"stop":105,"duration":19.61},{"text":"For example, we tax hospitals, churches; there are clerical exemptions, etcetera but other organizations such as the Salvation Army, the Colorado Bar Association, etcetera, are covered under the Colorado Employment Security Act.","start":105,"stop":118.815,"duration":13.81},{"text":"Colorado is one of three states which taxes non-profit corporations under its Colorado Employment Security Act.","start":118.815,"stop":126.811,"duration":8},{"text":"The other two states are Alaska and Hawaii.","start":126.811,"stop":130.709,"duration":3.9},{"text":"Now two of these states, namely: Colorado and Alaska elected to tax the American National Red Cross under the Employment Security Acts and as a result, this action was brought in the Colorado District Court, United Stated District Court, seeking a permanent injunction against the Colorado Department of Employment and its executive director, Bernardi Tist, from assessing further taxes against the American National Red Cross.","start":130.709,"stop":159.612,"duration":28.9},{"text":"The Department of Employment appeared and moved to dismiss the action and moved to strike the United States of America as a party-plaintiff to this action and the appellee moved for a summary judgment.","start":159.612,"stop":172.511,"duration":12.9},{"text":"These matters were argued to a three-judge court in the United States District Court and upon hearing of oral arguments, the United State District Court denied the Motion for Summary Judgment, denied our Motion to Dismiss and granted our Motion to Strike the United States Government on the grounds that they had failed to state an adequate claim for relief.","start":172.511,"stop":191.415,"duration":18.9},{"text":"Then, the matter was heard on its merits and upon the conclusion of the trial, the United States District Court so ruled that the American National Red Cross is an instrumentality or agency of the United States Government.","start":191.415,"stop":203.689,"duration":12.27},{"text":"They reinstated the United States as a party-plaintiff on this matter and this matter is now on appeal to this Court on a direct appeal.","start":203.689,"stop":213.145,"duration":9.46},{"text":"Now, directing my argument to these three issues, I would like to direct my argument primarily first of all to the second question because it has near relation to question no. 1.","start":213.145,"stop":225.62,"duration":12.47},{"text":"We submit that the American National Red Cross is not an instrumentality or an agency of the United States Government.","start":225.62,"stop":232.657,"duration":7.04},{"text":"It is a creature of Congress under Title XXXVI and so is the Boy Scouts, there is the American Revolution, the American Historical Society, reference of foreign works, etcetera.","start":232.657,"stop":248.488,"duration":15.83},{"text":"But Congress has manifested and expressed intent that the American National Red Cross is an agency or instrumentality of the United States Government.","start":248.488,"stop":258.116,"duration":9.63},{"text":"In fact, looking at the Act itself in Title XXXVI and referring also to Title X, Congress conveys fact that this is a private organization rendering voluntary assistance to the United States Government when it is requested to do so.","start":258.116,"stop":276.605,"duration":18.49},{"text":"Now, under Title X, for example, there are two provisos in there which I think are significant in construing the legal status of the American National Red Cross.","start":276.605,"stop":286.44,"duration":9.83},{"text":"One is the fact that refers to the power of the President to accept the assistance of the American National Red Cross.","start":286.44,"stop":294.048,"duration":7.61},{"text":"It never speaks about a duty for the American National Red Cross to comply with federal request.","start":294.048,"stop":300.978,"duration":6.93},{"text":"In fact, all of these matters in which the Red Cross assists the United States Government are bilateral agreements and of a voluntary nature.","start":300.978,"stop":309.924,"duration":8.95},{"text":"The second matter, which is of importance in Title X is the fact that Congress specifically provided in Section 2602 (e) that Red Cross employee should not be considered as Federal employee or employees of the United States Government.","start":309.924,"stop":325.896,"duration":15.97},{"text":"Now, there are -- in other -- in actions in the past, some of which I do not submit as precedent, and I’m sure counsel for the other side would not as submit as precedent, there are ceremonies of proclamations by former Presidents of the United States which say that, “It is a quasi organization or an instrumentality or agency of the United States Government”.","start":325.896,"stop":343.705,"duration":17.81},{"text":"On the other hand, the Secretary of Labor in 1944 passed a regulation stating that Red Cross and Salvation Army were not instrumentalities of the United States Government.","start":343.705,"stop":352.568,"duration":8.86},{"text":"Internal Revenue Code has made rulings on this matter, but Congress has spoken once again in Title XLII under the National Disaster Act.","start":352.568,"stop":365.269,"duration":12.7},{"text":"And, of course, one of the roles of the American National Red Cross, it has four-fold purposes: one, is to assist the Armed Forces; two, is to give disaster relief; three, is to conduct fund appeals and four, is to interpret the Red Cross to the local community and these are brought out by the testimony on page 100 of the record.","start":365.269,"stop":386.227,"duration":20.96},{"text":"But one of their -- as their assistance to the Armed Forces or, excuse me, under the -- so far as the National Disaster is concerned under the Title XLII, under the National Disaster Act, it specifically provides in defining federal agencies that the American National Read Cross shall not be considered an agency of the United States Government.","start":386.227,"stop":409.136,"duration":22.91},{"text":"Now, looking to the charter so to speak for the enabling statute for the American Red Cross, there are other manifestations of Congress which show that the United States has not exerted a power or a controlling power over the American National Red Cross.","start":409.136,"stop":425.659,"duration":16.52},{"text":"For one, the President has the power to appoint 8 to a board of 50 members.","start":425.659,"stop":431.056,"duration":5.4},{"text":"In of this, none fit into the executive committee.","start":431.056,"stop":435.335,"duration":4.28},{"text":"Then the Act refers to voluntary relief, voluntary assistance etcetera and then once again and by previous actions of the Red Cross, and by the evidence in the record it shows that these are agreements where they meet, they enter into a bilateral agreement and they carry these matters up.","start":435.335,"stop":453.258,"duration":17.92},{"text":"The Red Cross would point out that they are the sole agent who disperses problems or supplies in times of disaster and yet the Salvation Army has brought up, by the evidence also, renders valuable assistance even though they may not be the recognized dispersing authority.","start":453.258,"stop":471.165,"duration":17.91},{"text":"The Salvation Army plays just as important role so far as the National Disasters are concerned and yet, the Salvation Army is taxed under the Colorado Employment Security Act.","start":471.165,"stop":481.293,"duration":10.13},{"text":"It does not rule itself out as an instrumentality or an agency of the United States Government.","start":481.293,"stop":486.278,"duration":4.99},{"text":"The President of the United States has only the power to accept the assistance of the Red Cross in other words, and I submit that that Red Cross works only in a private sector and not a public sector.","start":486.278,"stop":499.383,"duration":13.1},{"text":"This was brought out by the testimony of Mr. Dermet (ph), who was former Director of the Office of the Emergency Planning and his testimony is set forth in folios or pages 79 and 86 of the record.","start":499.383,"stop":511.52,"duration":12.14},{"text":"So in essence, the Red Cross gives voluntary relief to private needs and from private funds.","start":511.52,"stop":519.697,"duration":8.18},{"text":"Now, another interesting facet -- is the fact that the American National Red Cross is one of various national organizations which belongs to the International Red Cross Conference.","start":519.697,"stop":530.846,"duration":11.15},{"text":"And as brought out also in the testimony on the record, the International Red Cross Conference, which is worldwide, requires in its charter that its member organizations remain autonomous, by that I mean that they remain autonomous from the government with which it works.","start":530.846,"stop":553.051,"duration":22.21},{"text":"There is no doubt that the role of the American National Red Cross is a noble one and a humanitarian one.","start":553.051,"stop":559.461,"duration":6.41},{"text":"And the interesting part of the testimony is the fact that it's not national humanitarian; it's international humanitarianism.","start":559.461,"stop":566.238,"duration":6.78},{"text":"In other words, as brought out by the testimony, they assist Armed Forces of enemy countries as well as those of our country.","start":566.238,"stop":574.63,"duration":8.39},{"text":"So they have this international humanitarian scheme.","start":574.63,"stop":577.775,"duration":3.14},{"text":"Of course, the Salvation Army renders the same service.","start":577.775,"stop":581.182,"duration":3.41}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"What are the particular respects which to your mind most clearly differentiate the Red Cross and National Banks for purposes of this question, the legal issue here?","start":581.182,"stop":595.818,"duration":14.64}]},{"speakerName":"James D. McKevitt","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Justice Fortas, my answer to that is Title X or, excuse me, Title XXII and that is this: that Congress has set forth a great number or many more controls over the instrument of National Banks.","start":595.818,"stop":609.413,"duration":13.6},{"text":"They have the power to pass on their mergers, appoint receivers, to pass on the or approve on the stock that they issue and that brief – they would take -- there are number ones which I have set forth in my Brief but they explicitly have (voice overlap) much more authority.","start":609.413,"stop":628.129,"duration":18.72}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"You have this in your Brief?","start":628.129,"stop":629.941,"duration":1.81}]},{"speakerName":"James D. McKevitt","textObjs":[{"text":"Yes, I do, Your Honor.","start":629.941,"stop":631.125,"duration":1.18},{"text":"I think it is in Title XXII.","start":631.125,"stop":634.385,"duration":3.26},{"text":"I would like to point out, for example the inside operation of the American National Red Cross.","start":634.385,"stop":639.797,"duration":5.41},{"text":"Yes it's true that they do have their national headquarters here on the United States Government land and interestingly enough, the next building to the South is the Daughters of the American Revolution.","start":639.797,"stop":650.185,"duration":10.39},{"text":"But at the same time, let's go to the Trade Michigan where they have a commercial building which they operate for a profit which the money goes back into the operation of the National Red Cross.","start":650.185,"stop":659.594,"duration":9.41},{"text":"Let's take for example the fact that through out the country, they retain private legal counsel.","start":659.594,"stop":664.071,"duration":4.48},{"text":"They have a private public accounting firm.","start":664.071,"stop":667.22,"duration":3.15},{"text":"They have two audits every year and one is conducted at their expense by asking themselves certified public accountants and the other is conducted by the Department of Defense and they are required to reimburse the Department of Defense for the audit.","start":667.22,"stop":680.47,"duration":13.25},{"text":"Now, this is one of the checks that the United States Government makes upon, but at the same time, the interesting point is that the United States Government does not give them any money.","start":680.47,"stop":689.033,"duration":8.56},{"text":"In fact, the Red Cross over the years has prided themselves on the fact that they receive no money from the United States Government.","start":689.033,"stop":695.015,"duration":5.98},{"text":"The Red Cross does not have a title so to speak in the American National Red Cross and in fact, looking at their motor vehicles, they are titled in the name of the American National Red Cross.","start":695.015,"stop":706.809,"duration":11.79},{"text":"Through out the states, they have -- they title their vehicles in their respective state registration requirements.","start":706.809,"stop":715.16,"duration":8.35},{"text":"There are nurses who are subject to local and state registrations and they subject themselves to withholding tax, for example, in the State of Colorado and another states.","start":715.16,"stop":723.834,"duration":8.67},{"text":"These matters are also set forth in the record.","start":723.834,"stop":728.451,"duration":4.62},{"text":"Now, counsel points out this case of Standard Oil versus Johnson, which this case is previously entered as decision in 316 US and which is set forth in both Briefs and, I think that that case is not controlling so far as this case is concerned.","start":728.451,"stop":742.494,"duration":14.04},{"text":"In fact, I think, it is easily distinguished.","start":742.494,"stop":744.735,"duration":2.24},{"text":"In that case, we talked about an army post exchange, a situation or a post exchange that was run by a member of the military service where the money is originally appropriated from the treasury to run the post exchange where salaries are paid by the United States Government for employees to run this and in the event that it closes up, the reversion of profits or balance goes back to the treasury.","start":744.735,"stop":769.015,"duration":24.28},{"text":"I submit another or in fact a better test insofar is the question on these matter is concerned is the case of Unemployment Compensation Commission of North Carolina versus Wachovia Bank and Trust, this is North Carolina case which is set forth on my Brief.","start":769.015,"stop":783.584,"duration":14.57},{"text":"And in there, the Court, the North Carolina Supreme Court, stated five elements to determine what constitutes a government instrumentality or agency.","start":783.584,"stop":792.454,"duration":8.87},{"text":"One was, did the government create it?","start":792.454,"stop":794.248,"duration":1.79},{"text":"Well, that's applicable here.","start":794.248,"stop":795.787,"duration":1.54},{"text":"No. 2, is that wholly owned by the government?","start":795.787,"stop":798.912,"duration":3.13},{"text":"This is not true here because it is not even partially owned by the government.","start":798.912,"stop":803.299,"duration":4.39},{"text":"Three, was it operated for profit?","start":803.299,"stop":805.601,"duration":2.3},{"text":"Well, this would be applicable here, the Red Cross is a non-profit organization.","start":805.601,"stop":810.302,"duration":4.7},{"text":"Is it engaged primarily in the governmental function is the forth test and we submit, the evidence was substantiated, that this is not their primary function.","start":810.302,"stop":819.737,"duration":9.43},{"text":"This is one of their functions, but this is not their major function.","start":819.737,"stop":823.716,"duration":3.98},{"text":"And the fifth and most important test is whether the proposed tax such as the Colorado Employment Security Act tax, which would come out of that Act, would that impose an economic burden on the Government of the United States?","start":823.716,"stop":838.269,"duration":14.55},{"text":"And I submit that this would not be the case.","start":838.269,"stop":840.811,"duration":2.54},{"text":"The United States Government would not be subject to this tax or would it create a burden on the United States Government in this regard.","start":840.811,"stop":848.401,"duration":7.59},{"text":"And this comes to – one of the key issues, I think the point is, that the reason the instrumentality exemption is set forth is to prevent a burden, undue burden on the United States Government.","start":848.401,"stop":861.688,"duration":13.29},{"text":"There would be no tax imposed.","start":861.688,"stop":863.313,"duration":1.63},{"text":"The United States Government would not be obligated in anyway for the payment of this tax and for such reason I think that that's the key test along with the other onus in the Wachovia case to show that Red Cross does not qualify as an agency of the United States Government.","start":863.313,"stop":879.48,"duration":16.17},{"text":"I've already pointed out the four functions of the American National Red Cross.","start":879.48,"stop":884.168,"duration":4.69},{"text":"I would like to refer to another case, that's Miller versus City of Greenbelt and in that – it cites also Grace versus New York, 306 US 466.","start":884.168,"stop":895.059,"duration":10.89},{"text":"In the language of the Court there, I'm referring to Grace versus New York, says that, “when the National Government lawfully acts through a corporation which it owns and controls, those activities are governmental functions entitled to tax immunity”.","start":895.059,"stop":907.352,"duration":12.29},{"text":"That is not the situation here.","start":907.352,"stop":909.776,"duration":2.42},{"text":"Concluding on this particular point, I think that the status of the Red Cross is best defined by Mr. Basal O'Conner, who was National Chairman of the American National Red Cross in 1946 and this is set forth in his quotation in the appellee's-plaintiff Exhibit “8” -- “18” which is the 1946 American Annual or American Red Cross Annual Report.","start":909.776,"stop":932.588,"duration":22.81},{"text":"Mr. O'conner stated “the International Red Cross Committee has always maintained that the National Societies, while cooperating closely with their own government and with other agencies but at the same time remain independent.","start":932.588,"stop":944.915,"duration":12.33},{"text":"This explains to a certain extent the unique position of the American Red Cross in the light of the country.","start":944.915,"stop":951.677,"duration":6.76},{"text":"Cooperating closely with the government it is in no sense a part of the government.","start":951.677,"stop":956.193,"duration":4.52},{"text":"Working hand in hand with many agencies, it still retains its freedom of action.","start":956.193,"stop":962.373,"duration":6.18},{"text":"And now, Your Honors, I would like to address my next remark issue no. 1 and that is the jurisdiction so far as the United States

respect.”","start":973.957,"stop":999.701,"duration":25.74},{"text":"Certainly, this statement is a very clear reflection and he said that similarly it is not the intention of the Bill to remove the
