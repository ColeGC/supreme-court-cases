case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.","start":24.934,"stop":32.084,"duration":7.15},{"text":"In that Court, the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit set aside the Federal Trade Commission's order that Procter & Gamble divest itself of assets from the Clorox Chemical Company, the nation's largest bleach manufacturer, which it had acquired through a merger.","start":32.084,"stop":53.84,"duration":21.76},{"text":"At the time of the merger in 1959 Procter & Gamble was among the nation's 50 largest manufacturing corporations.","start":53.84,"stop":64.179,"duration":10.34},{"text":"It's sales in 1957 were an excess of $1 billion.","start":64.179,"stop":72.599,"duration":8.42},{"text":"Procter & Gamble is a large diversified manufacturer of low price rapid turnover household products sold primarily through grocery, drug, and department stores.","start":72.599,"stop":88.265,"duration":15.67},{"text":"Its annual sales of soaps and detergents in Kansas alone, products very similar to bleach were more than $500 million in 1957, for example.","start":88.265,"stop":102.422,"duration":14.16},{"text":"Procter's principal products are marketing to housewives largely by what is called “pre-selling.”","start":102.422,"stop":110.875,"duration":8.45},{"text":"By pre-selling it's understood to mean that through advertising and other sales promotions.Data in 1957, Procter was the largest advertiser in the country, spending more than $80 million on advertising and an additional $47 million in promotions.","start":110.875,"stop":132.773,"duration":21.9},{"text":"Expenditures on advertising substantially greater than the total sales of the two leading bleach producers, Clorox and Purex.","start":132.773,"stop":143.873,"duration":11.1},{"text":"Between 1946 and 1962, product's net sales increased by more than 400% which shows recent rapid growth in its product sales, and this also showed a rapid diversification into new product lines closely related to its existing lines.","start":143.873,"stop":168.733,"duration":24.86},{"text":"Procter's president justified that approximately 70% of Procter's household product volume came from products not even in existence in 1946.","start":168.733,"stop":182.57,"duration":13.84},{"text":"The more narrow period between 1952 and 1957, Procter's sales rose some 40%.","start":182.57,"stop":190.361,"duration":7.79},{"text":"A substantial part of that growth was due to the introduction of new brands and product lines in which product -- Procter has not previously been selling.","start":190.361,"stop":202.672,"duration":12.31},{"text":"Now, as to the Clorox Company, in 1957, the Clorox Chemical Company was engaged almost exclusively in the manufacture and sale of household liquid bleach.","start":202.672,"stop":217.143,"duration":14.47},{"text":"With 13 plants located throughout the country, Clorox was the only truly nationwide manufacturer and seller of liquid bleach.","start":217.143,"stop":228.901,"duration":11.76},{"text":"It accounted for 48.8% of the nation's total annual sales of household liquid bleach, and in some regional markets, Clorox's sale was even higher.","start":228.901,"stop":242.52,"duration":13.62},{"text":"For example, the mid-Atlantic States where Clorox had 72% of all the sales of liquid bleach.","start":242.52,"stop":250.916,"duration":8.4},{"text":"Now, what is liquid bleach?","start":250.916,"stop":253.469,"duration":2.55},{"text":"Household liquid bleach is used principally as a whitener in the cleansing of clothes, cleaning of clothes and also it's used as a germicide and disinfectant at times.","start":253.469,"stop":267.059,"duration":13.59},{"text":"All major brands of liquid bleach are chemically identical, a solution of five-and-one-quarter percent sodium high chloride in water.","start":267.059,"stop":281.634,"duration":14.57},{"text":"Bleach is easily manufactured and its manufacture involves no patents and no trade secrets, and it's a concentrated industry.","start":281.634,"stop":295.661,"duration":14.03},{"text":"The bleach industry, despite the lack of technological barriers to entry remains highly concentrated.","start":295.661,"stop":304.527,"duration":8.87},{"text":"Two firms, Clorox with 48.8% of national sales and the Purex Company with 15.7% accounted in 1959 for about 65% of the total sales of household liquid bleach.","start":304.527,"stop":324.086,"duration":19.56},{"text":"Six firms indeed accounted for 80% of all of the sales.","start":324.086,"stop":329.853,"duration":5.77},{"text":"The remaining 20% is scattered among some 200 other producers, most of which are quite small.","start":329.853,"stop":340.039,"duration":10.19},{"text":"Concentration is even greater on a local or regional basis.","start":340.039,"stop":344.605,"duration":4.57},{"text":"This is due in part to the high cost of transportation of bleach in relation to its unit price.","start":344.605,"stop":352.787,"duration":8.18},{"text":"Freight averages about 10% of the cost.","start":352.787,"stop":356.618,"duration":3.83},{"text":"Thus, it is generally not economical for a manufacturer to sell beyond 300 miles of its plant.","start":356.618,"stop":364.179,"duration":7.56},{"text":"So as I've said, only Clorox has enough plants at various locations to sell throughout the country and to be nationwide in production.","start":364.179,"stop":374.472,"duration":10.29},{"text":"Even Purex, the second ranking seller, distributes its bleach in only one half of the nation.","start":374.472,"stop":381.529,"duration":7.06},{"text":"The result is that the shares of the leading producers are larger in particular areas than the national figures would indicate.","start":381.529,"stop":390.28,"duration":8.75},{"text":"For example, at the time of the merger, Clorox and two other firms had 97.8% of all the bleach sales in metropolitan Chicago.","start":390.28,"stop":400.756,"duration":10.48},{"text":"Clorox and one other had 88% of the Southwest region, Clorox and another had 81% of the Pacific market, and Clorox alone has 70% of all the sales in the mid-Atlantic States.","start":400.756,"stop":418.359,"duration":17.6},{"text":"Bleach is like other low priced rapid turnover household items heavily pre-sold by the manufacture through advertising.","start":418.359,"stop":431.146,"duration":12.79},{"text":"For example, in its last full year of independent operation, Clorox spent an amount equivalent to approximately 10% of its annual sales for advertising, and numerous witnesses testified to the critical importance of advertising and promotional efforts by the manufacturer in order to create sufficient demand for his brand and to entitle it to sufficient shelf space which is allocated by the retailers according to the consumers' demand.","start":431.146,"stop":467.81,"duration":36.66},{"text":"Thus, this case involves the acquisition of the nation's dominant liquid bleach producer by the nation's leading manufacturer of other household products closely related to bleach such as detergents, soaps and cleansers or more broadly the nation's leading manufacturers, of Procter & Gamble's own annual report in 56 and 57 states quote.","start":467.81,"stop":496.861,"duration":29.05},{"text":"“Low priced, rapid turnover, household items sold primarily to grocery, drug and department stores.”","start":496.861,"stop":507.247,"duration":10.39},{"text":"Because of the functionally related product lines and merger, though conglomerate rather than horizontal or vertical, was aptly described by the Commission as one involving product extension by the acquiring firm of Procter.","start":507.247,"stop":525.714,"duration":18.47},{"text":"At this point, I would not like to recite all of the reasons given in the opinion of the Commission which led the Commission to conclude to the effect of the merger and the words of Section 7 of the Clayton Act may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in the relevant market nor shall I recite in detail the reasons given by the Sixth Circuit -- by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for its setting aside of the Commission order.","start":525.714,"stop":561.637,"duration":35.92},{"text":"Indeed, in this case Procter & Gamble points out in its brief the full thrust of the Court of Appeals' decision to be as follows, the Procter & Gamble in its brief says, “The division of -- the decision of the Court of Appeals predicated upon a comprehensive consideration of the whole record in this case turns upon one ultimate finding.”","start":561.637,"stop":588.457,"duration":26.82},{"text":"The Court said, “Considering the record as a whole, we are of the opinion that the decision of the Second Commission is not supported by substantial evidence.”","start":588.457,"stop":601.063,"duration":12.61},{"text":"It is partly all that the Court

practically the same thing and the Commission in its second opinion held that it was not bound at all by the first opinion.","start":630.192,"stop":642.98,"duration":12.79},{"text":"It was not the law of the case and indeed the law had changed in the interim by the Brown Shoe case and the National Bank

commission.","start":656.619,"stop":665.706,"duration":9.09},{"text":"Suffice it to say at this point that in our view the Court of Appeals while extensively finding the order not supported by substantial evidence, in fact, actually, disagreed which the Commission's conclusion.","start":665.706,"stop":684.047,"duration":18.34},{"text":"One, by substituting its own conclusion that the bleach industry was competitive for the Commission's finding to the contrary, and two, by its failure to properly evaluate the economic and antitrust implications of potential competition and barriers to inquiry of new firms in the oligopolistic industries.","start":684.047,"stop":711.545,"duration":27.5},{"text":"Now, first of all under Section 7 as Commissioner Elman said and nobody will dispute there is process standard as to where you're under Section 7 or not.","start":711.545,"stop":723.219,"duration":11.67},{"text":"But there are certain matters that are recognized.","start":723.219,"stop":727.03,"duration":3.81},{"text":"For example, there can be no doubt that in a highly concentrated market where a few of the sellers account for most of the sales, a significant, perhaps insignificant form of competitive restraint is that of potential competition.","start":727.03,"stop":744.569,"duration":17.54},{"text":"The treat to other firms outside the market might enter if the conditions within the market such as the setting of high price level make entry attractive.","start":744.569,"stop":756.852,"duration":12.28},{"text":"A merger then which eliminates potential competition by removing a likely entrant to the market or which weakens potential competition by increasing the barriers to entry into the market may each thereby violate Section 7.","start":756.852,"stop":775.945,"duration":19.09},{"text":"With these general propositions I don't believe there can be much dispute.","start":775.945,"stop":781.295,"duration":5.35},{"text":"But the respondents assert and the court below agreed that the Commission had no factually adequate basis and, hence, no legally justifiable reasons for concluding that Procter's acquisition of Clorox might probably impair the efficiency of potential competition.","start":781.295,"stop":804.196,"duration":22.9},{"text":"We think the Commission's order should have been sustained.","start":804.196,"stop":807.883,"duration":3.69},{"text":"And as for these reasons, first, the Commission examined in detail the structure of the household liquid bleach market and it found that two items, the two firms accounted for 65% of the nation's total sales and it found that in some section of the country the share of one firm, usually Clorox, approached monopoly proportions and that in other sections Clorox and one or two others accounted for 80% of the sales of bleach.","start":807.883,"stop":846.369,"duration":38.49},{"text":"The Commission found that the dominant firm, Clorox, was a recognized price leader and that other firms almost uniformly followed Clorox's lead in setting prices.","start":846.369,"stop":860.298,"duration":13.93},{"text":"Thus, the Commission concluded that the industry was highly concentrated and oligopolistic.","start":860.298,"stop":868.737,"duration":8.44},{"text":"The Court of Appeals, however, thought that the evidence did not establish that there was anything unhealthy about the market's conditions.","start":868.737,"stop":879,"duration":10.26},{"text":"And in making this conclusion that there was nothing unhealthy, they relied on o nly two facts.","start":879,"stop":886.207,"duration":7.21},{"text":"One was the existence of a fringe of some 200 producers accounting for 20% of the nation sales.","start":886.207,"stop":895.107,"duration":8.9},{"text":"Yet, the Commission had specifically noted that only eight fringe manufacturers had assets of over million dollars and very few had assets of more than $75,000.","start":895.107,"stop":908.942,"duration":13.84},{"text":"Plainly, the Commission was correct in concluding that the existence of the small firms gave no assurance of competition within the industry, especially in light of the emphasis in the industry on product differentiation through mass advertising.","start":908.942,"stop":927.381,"duration":18.44},{"text":"The second part relied under the Court of Appeals, was its conclusion that the industry was healthy and that point was that after merger, after the merger, producers other than Clorox where quote, “Were selling more bleach for more money than ever before.\"","start":927.381,"stop":1482.921,"duration":555.54},{"text":"End of quote.","start":1482.921,"stop":949.222,"duration":-533.7},{"text":"But the record shows that Clorox in the same period increased its market share from 48.7% to 52%.","start":949.222,"stop":958.499,"duration":9.28},{"text":"In short, the court below patently erred in rejecting the Commission's conclusions concerning the industry.","start":958.499,"stop":967.18,"duration":8.68},{"text":"That error underlies the Courts failed to recognize the importance of the potential competition, the point which I would like to discuss.","start":967.18,"stop":978.404,"duration":11.22},{"text":"Respondent asserts and the court below agreed that the Commission's conclusion with respect to Procter's likely entrant and with respect to the probe competitive effective of a threat of entry posed by this, both of which relate to potential competition are unsupported in the record.Let us turn to the evidence on potential competition and the inferences drawn there from -- by the Commission.","start":978.404,"stop":1010.393,"duration":31.99},{"text":"Procter's history of expansion and diversification through product extension, the functionally closely related product lines and the true intra-corporate memoranda of the Procter Company relating to the bleach industry and the Clorox Company.","start":1010.393,"stop":1030.753,"duration":20.36},{"text":"Now, there are two memoranda in the record in which in the first, Procter said, “Procter's experts suggested that while it might be good to go in to the liquid bleach industry it would not be profitable.","start":1030.753,"stop":1047.69,"duration":16.94},{"text":"And the second one, urged that they buy Clorox providing they could buy it for $30 million or less.”","start":1047.69,"stop":1055.686,"duration":8},{"text":"I have only averted to the evidence on the first two points, but to recapitulate Procter had a history of expansion and diversification in the industries where it had not previously sold.","start":1055.686,"stop":1070.785,"duration":15.1},{"text":"Some of the expansion was internal and some by acquisition, but all of it involved the same items, low price, rapid turnover, household items, functionally related to similar production, distribution or marketing techniques, including heavy emphasis on product differentiation and the pre-selling through mass advertising.","start":1070.785,"stop":1100.969,"duration":30.18},{"text":"And in addition Procter is a recognized leader in the field of soaps, detergents and cleansers.","start":1100.969,"stop":1108.164,"duration":7.19},{"text":"Products whose function in relation to bleach is even more pronounced because of similar and complimentary uses.","start":1108.164,"stop":1118.245,"duration":10.08},{"text":"Procter has been expanding in these very areas steadily and its strength and success in product extension is demonstrated as the Commission found by the Comet abrasive cleansing campaign.","start":1118.245,"stop":1136.657,"duration":18.41},{"text":"Procter introduced Comet in 1957 at a time when Colgate-Palmolive's brand Ajax accounted for roughly 56% of the sales of abrasive cleansers.","start":1136.657,"stop":1150.359,"duration":13.7},{"text":"In the course of 22 months, Procter spent $7.2 million on advertising and promotional activities for Comet, and then -- thereby achieved its 36.5% of the market.","start":1150.359,"stop":1169.219,"duration":18.86},{"text":"Despite this evidence of Procter's expansion by product extension into functionally closely related product lines, the Court of Appeals discarded this conclusion and substituted its own conclusions as follows, quote, “Household liquid bleach is an old product.","start":1169.219,"stop":1190.564,"duration":21.35},{"text":"Procter is an old company.","start":1190.564,"stop":1193.29,"duration":2.73},{"text":"If Procter wants to bring it, it is a prime that it never lost its balance and fell in during the many years in which such bleach was on the market.”","start":1193.29,"stop":1204.087,"duration":10.8},{"text":"While in addition to the evidence of Procter's expansion into industries in which it had not previously sold, the Commission again weighed Procter's study of the bleach market and of the Clorox Company has demonstrated in these two memoranda, 55 and 57, and we discussed that evidence in our brief at pages 17 and 19.","start":1204.087,"stop":1228.982,"duration":24.89},{"text":"Respondent, however, is quite correct in stating that the recommendation of Procter's officials was at that time against independent entry through internal expansion.","start":1228.982,"stop":1241.92,"duration":12.94},{"text":"But the fact is that that memorandum shows that Procter considered the bleach industry and had recognized that no one should doubt that the market was complimentary to those of the other Procter products.","start":1241.92,"stop":1260.495,"duration":18.57},{"text":"There were some -- seldom be anymore direct evidence that a firm is a likely entering into a new field.Or that it exercise a pro competitive influence by its presence on the fringe of the market beyond what we have here.","start":1260.495,"stop":1278.638,"duration":18.14},{"text":"Yet, the picture is not quite complete.","start":1278.638,"stop":1281.69,"duration":3.05},{"text":"There is also some evidence summarized in note 38 in page 46 of our brief that for example a small firm discontinued to manufacture bleach because of the acquisition of Clorox by Procter.","start":1281.69,"stop":1298.332,"duration":16.64},{"text":"All of this evidence, especially in light of the Commission's detailed analysis of the market structure, we think it clearly shows that Procter presented potential competition in the bleach industry.","start":1298.332,"stop":1315.162,"duration":16.83},{"text":"Now, to another aspect of the merger, the merger substituted for Clorox which had assets of $12 million and sales of $40 million, the Procter Company which in 1957 had sales in excess of a billion and profits of more than $47 million.","start":1315.162,"stop":1338.238,"duration":23.08},{"text":"More strikingly, however, is the comparison of the combined Procter and Clorox with the remaining competitors in the bleach industry.","start":1338.238,"stop":1349.48,"duration":11.24},{"text":"The others had remaining -- the others and remaining major bleach firm, Purex, which is more diversified then was Clorox had sales in a year prior to the merger totalling 5% of Procter.","start":1349.48,"stop":1365.977,"duration":16.5},{"text":"In short, Procter separately grows the remaining firms in the industry for a dominant single product manufacture of bleach.","start":1365.977,"stop":1377.945,"duration":11.97},{"text":"The merger substitutes giant multi product firm dominant in several product lines yet respondent Procter & Gamble has asserted and the Courts of Appeals recited that the -- that the Commission's decision condemn big business per se, and based its decision on Procter's size.","start":1377.945,"stop":1405.738,"duration":27.79},{"text":"That factual argument does not do justice to the Commission's careful and able opinion where the Commission over and over again made its position quite explicit.","start":1405.738,"stop":1416.636,"duration":10.9},{"text":"For example, the Commission said it should be very clear that in deeming Procter size a pertinent consideration in the decision of this case, we are most emphatically not adapting any view that big business per se is anticompetitive or undesirable and should be attacked under Section 7 or any other antitrust statute.","start":1416.636,"stop":1444.38,"duration":27.74},{"text":"Procter's size is significant in this case only insofar as it is huge -- as it is hugely disparate compared with the size of the firms in the relevant market.","start":1444.38,"stop":1458.41,"duration":14.03},{"text":"“Disparity of size not absolute size has importance in a merger of this kind.","start":1458.41,"stop":1465.637,"duration":7.23},{"text":"Moreover, we do not suggest that size disparity is relevant to the decision of every merger case.","start":1465.637,"stop":1475.199,"duration":9.56},{"text":"Quite possibly there are industries in which size disparity has little or no competitive significance.”","start":1475.199,"stop":1485.205,"duration":10.01},{"text":"And the Commission then went on to show why in this case size disparity had great competitive significance because of the identical nature of a product sales depending on product differentiation through mass advertising and the large multi product firm, the Commission found quite apart from advertising discounts had great competitive advantages.","start":1485.205,"stop":1515.118,"duration":29.91},{"text":"It could buy network programs and advertise several related products and it could in contrast to smaller firms afford to advertise on national network shows and thus advertise during programs when advertising is most effective.","start":1515.118,"stop":1535.865,"duration":20.75},{"text":"It also would have greater regional advertising flexibility and selectivity.","start":1535.865,"stop":1542.138,"duration":6.27},{"text":"It could engage in joint sales promotion largely unavailable to smaller single product firms.","start":1542.138,"stop":1550.336,"duration":8.2},{"text":"In short, such a large firm would raise various entry by effective product differentiation and this would go for all of the smaller firm.","start":1550.336,"stop":1561.172,"duration":10.84},{"text":"Moreover, the Commission reasoned, the substitution of Procter for Clorox makes entry and possible de-concentration of the industry fall as likely.","start":1561.172,"stop":1574.585,"duration":13.41},{"text":"Instead of taking on the dominant Clorox and enter -- a perspective entrant would have to challenge a dominant
