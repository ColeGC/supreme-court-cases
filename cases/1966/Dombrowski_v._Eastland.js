that the court below rejected their main contention and said, “Were that the only issue in this case?","start":588.738,"stop":605.855,"duration":17.12},{"text":"Then we would be constraint to have great difficulty to find that there were not disputed issues of facts upon involving their participation in the conspiracy which would require exploration by a trial.”","start":605.855,"stop":622.077,"duration":16.22},{"text":"So that the respondents are here before this Court in effect asking this Court to reject the conclusion of the lower court that as to
