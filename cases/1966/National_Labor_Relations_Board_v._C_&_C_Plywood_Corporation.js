one that was before the Court yesterday in the Acme case.","start":12.229,"stop":22.006,"duration":9.78},{"text":"Here, a union filed with the National Labor Relations Board a charge that an employer

contract.","start":22.006,"stop":43.933,"duration":21.93},{"text":"The employer offered as a defense, that what he had done was sanctioned by the terms of the collective bargaining contract.","start":43.933,"stop":52.726,"duration":8.79},{"text":"And the question presented in the case is whether in order to determine the unfair labor practice charge, the National Labor Relations Board has authority to interpret the collective bargaining agreement rather than as the Court of Appeals held, the board is required to re-meet the parties to a judicial lawsuit in order to have that issue determine because in this case, unlike the Acme case, the contract does not contain an arbitration provision.","start":52.726,"stop":84.752,"duration":32.03},{"text":"The company is a manufacturer of plywood and the employees involved here are members of something called a ““glue spreader”” crew.","start":84.752,"stop":93.48,"duration":8.73},{"text":"This is a group of employees who glues together the various pieces of the wood that combine to make the finished piece of plywood.","start":93.48,"stop":102.22,"duration":8.74},{"text":"The crew ordinarily consists of four employees and these four employees have broken down into three different categories of workers.","start":102.22,"stop":112.586,"duration":10.37},{"text":"The company ended into a collective bargaining agreement with the Union under which particular wages was set for each of these three different jobs in the “glue spreader” crew, rending from $2.15 to $2.29 an hour, and the contract also provided that during its term, the wages would be closed.","start":112.586,"stop":137.623,"duration":25.04},{"text":"Paragraph 17 of the contract, which is a critical paragraphing above here and set forth at the bottom of page 67 of the record, after stating that the employer and the Union had agreed upon a classified wage scale which was incorporated in the contract went on to state that the employer reserves the right to pay a premium rate over and above the contractual classified wage rights to reward any particular employee for some special fitness, skill, aptitude or the like.","start":137.623,"stop":173.281,"duration":35.66},{"text":"Three weeks after this contract had been signed, without consulting a bargaining with the Union, the company inaugurated what it called a premium pay plan for the “glue spreaders”.","start":173.281,"stop":187.035,"duration":13.75},{"text":"That plan is set forth to page 73 of the record, and what it provided in essence was that whenever, in any particular one-week period, the glue crew, the four members, exceeded a certain production quota, each member of the crew was to get not the schedule rate in the contract that a higher amount of $2.15 an hour, every member of the crew was to get this.","start":187.035,"stop":211.395,"duration":24.36},{"text":"It was not tied to the performance of any individual person.","start":211.395,"stop":215.847,"duration":4.45},{"text":"The Union found out about this plan when a member of the Union brought a copy of the thing and the Union and the company then met on two occasions in which the Union protested that this proposed glue spreader plan was not justified under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement as the Union explained to the company in its view that this was not just a change in wages but a basic change in the method of computing wages.","start":215.847,"stop":244.915,"duration":29.07},{"text":"It was not just giving a premium but involved a shift in computing wages from a straight alley basis to a production basis and therefore, in the Union's view is not justified by the contract.","start":244.915,"stop":256.216,"duration":11.3},{"text":"The company on the other hand, contended that it was justified by the contract and refused to cancel the plan and then the Union filed a charge with the Board alleging that the company engaged in an unfair labor practice by instituting this plan.","start":256.216,"stop":271.306,"duration":15.09}]},{"speakerName":"Byron R.

moment to what the Board held in this case.","start":474.553,"stop":478.308,"duration":3.75},{"text":"It pointed out that it has frequently interpreted contracts in performing its functions under the Act and in this particular case, there was no proceeding had been invoked by the parties.","start":478.308,"stop":492.076,"duration":13.77},{"text":"There was no pending arbitration proceeding either before a court or an arbitrator and therefore the reasons which sometimes lead the Board to defer to the tendency of another proceeding were not present here.","start":492.076,"stop":506.074,"duration":14},{"text":"The Board then turned, went on an interpreted a particular contract and it concluded on the basis of its examination of the language of the contract and the negotiations between the parties that the purpose of this provision, this premium pay plan, was only to give the employer the right to make individual merit increases for the special competence of a particular employee but not to select a group of employees and unilaterally to change the basic method of compensating them from a straight time basis to a production basis.","start":506.074,"stop":539.262,"duration":33.19},{"text":"And in reaching this conclusion, the Board concluded that what had been done by the Union in this case did not amount to a waiver on its part of the right to bargain about what it called a wage incentive system.","start":539.262,"stop":553.948,"duration":14.69},{"text":"The Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board's order.","start":553.948,"stop":557.745,"duration":3.8},{"text":"It stated its problems, it said, since the existence or nonexistence of an unfair labor practice, does not turn entirely upon the provisions of the Act.","start":557.745,"stop":566.948,"duration":9.2},{"text":"But arguably upon a good faith dispute as to the correct meaning of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, the Board had no jurisdiction to proceed because it said, whether or not this contract authorize what the company had done, was a matter to be decided by an arbitrator if there was an arbitration provision or if no such provision to be adjudicated by the Court.","start":566.948,"stop":590.039,"duration":23.09},{"text":"Now, the answer I think we can fairly say that we and the respondent are in common ground on two general propositions.","start":590.039,"stop":597.939,"duration":7.9},{"text":"First, that the Board has no general authority to enforce collective bargaining agreements.","start":597.939,"stop":604.855,"duration":6.92},{"text":"And secondly, that the mere breach of a collective bargaining agreement of itself is not enough to create and give rise to an unfair labor practice.","start":604.855,"stop":613.818,"duration":8.96},{"text":"Will we part company with the respondent in this case is when it argues that here, basically the unfair labor practice rest upon the breach of the contract.","start":613.818,"stop":625.621,"duration":11.8},{"text":"We think that is not the basis here.","start":625.621,"stop":627.353,"duration":1.73},{"text":"That here, the unfair labor practice rested on the company's failure to perform its duty to bargain with the employer -- with the Union before making any material changes in terms and conditions of employment.","start":627.353,"stop":641.122,"duration":13.77},{"text":"I think the Board stated its philosophy of the decision in this case very well at the bottom page 96, where it said that in filing its unfair labor practice, the Union was complaining not of a violation of its contract with respondent but of the invasion of its statutory right as collective bargaining representative of employees in the unit to bargain about any changes in the terms and condition of employment for such employee.","start":641.122,"stop":667.895,"duration":26.77},{"text":"So as we see the case here, basically, we think it involves three issues.","start":667.895,"stop":671.654,"duration":3.76},{"text":"One, whether apart from the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, what the employer did here constituted is the refusal to bargain.","start":671.654,"stop":680.405,"duration":8.75},{"text":"Two, whether the Board was authorized in itself interpreting the contract rather than leaving it to the parties to go to court, and three, whether in the fact to this case, the Board's interpretation of the contract was proper one.","start":680.405,"stop":693.807,"duration":13.4},{"text":"Now I'd like the first turn of the threshold issue of refusal to bargain which as far as I can tell the respondent does not challenged here but since this is the keystone of the Board's decision, I think it's a accordant to deal with it briefly.","start":693.807,"stop":707.91,"duration":14.1},{"text":"The duty with Section 8 (a)(5) imposes on an Employer and a Union to bargain collectively is defined in Section 8 (d) as the performance of the mutual obligation of the Employer and the Union to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment for a negotiation of any agreement or any question arising there under.","start":707.91,"stop":734.809,"duration":26.9}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Now, the employer here as I understand it says, “We did bargain.","start":734.809,"stop":739.633,"duration":4.82},{"text":"We did bargain in good faith and we provided in our collective bargaining agreement for our liberty to do just what we did here.","start":739.633,"stop":746.581,"duration":6.95},{"text":"And when you're asking us not to bargain about this, it's you, the Union who is in bad faith because we bargained about that and reach to an agreement.”","start":746.581,"stop":755.87,"duration":9.29}]},{"speakerName":"Friedman","textObjs":[{"text":"Well that Mr. Justice, the Union -- it isn't that the Union is asking the Employer to bargain -- our position is that during the term of the collective bargaining agreement, if the employer attempts unilaterally without bargaining with the Union to make any substantial modifications in that thing, he cannot do it.","start":755.87,"stop":775.254,"duration":19.38}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Well of course, the employer's position is, I'm not making any modifications in the contract, I'm simply doing what I was permitted to do as a result of our previous collective bargaining.","start":775.254,"stop":785.027,"duration":9.77}]},{"speakerName":"Friedman","textObjs":[{"text":"That's right, but that I would suggest Mr. Justice is a defense basically.","start":785.027,"stop":788.777,"duration":3.75},{"text":"This is something you --","start":788.777,"stop":789.479,"duration":0.7}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, what I wonder what the point of collective bargaining is, if you can never reach a bargain that sticks.","start":789.479,"stop":793.99,"duration":4.51}]},{"speakerName":"Friedman","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, you can Mr. Justice if they had reached the bargain.","start":793.99,"stop":797.043,"duration":3.05},{"text":"But the question in the case is whether what the Union agreed to in this case, in effect gave the employer authority to make this kind of a change which the employer says he did have.","start":797.043,"stop":808.632,"duration":11.59},{"text":"And we say that on the circumstances it did not authorize the employer to make a change.","start":808.632,"stop":813.029,"duration":4.4},{"text":"But we further say that in deciding whether there has been a refusal to bargain here, the Board is authorized to examine the basis on which the employer purported to justify what he had done.","start":813.029,"stop":828.505,"duration":15.48},{"text":"Now, this as was developed also during the argument in the preceding case the duty of the bargaining we think clearly is not limited just to working out the initial terms of the collective bargaining agreement that continues during the life of the contract.","start":828.505,"stop":844.6,"duration":16.1},{"text":"Now, four years ago in the Katz case, this Court held that where during negotiations, an employer unilaterally and without consulting with the Union, made significant changes in the rights of pay in sick leave, that that constituted a refusal to bargain without regard to the employer's good faith.","start":844.6,"stop":867.801,"duration":23.2},{"text":"And as I put it in so holding that such unilateral changes said, frustrates the objectives of Section 8(a)(5) much as does a flat refusal to negotiate at all.","start":867.801,"stop":879.507,"duration":11.71},{"text":"And we think the same reasoning requires that during the term of a collective agreement, after the agreement has been added on into, similarly, neither side can make unilateral changes without conferring with the other.","start":879.507,"stop":893.631,"duration":14.12},{"text":"The basic philosophy of the whole concept of requiring collective bargaining embodied in 8(a)(5), is that industrial peace will be furthered.","start":893.631,"stop":903.009,"duration":9.38},{"text":"If the parties to a contract before making changes get together and talk about it, they don't have to reach agreement that's explicit in the statute.","start":903.009,"stop":911.206,"duration":8.2},{"text":"But we think they do have to get together and talk about it and therefore, the philosophy of the statute is neither side can make significant changes in the basic employment relationship, the terms and conditions of employment without first considering, without first consulting and discussing it with the other side.","start":911.206,"stop":929.691,"duration":18.49},{"text":"Now in this case, we think it's very clearly that the change that the employer made was a significant change.","start":929.691,"stop":936.312,"duration":6.62},{"text":"Under the contract, does it previously existed
