and as I read the statute does not control.","start":94.286,"stop":107.887,"duration":13.6},{"text":"In this case, the petitioner in 206 is a group of contractors who formed an association that have bargained with Local 22 affiliated with the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos workers.","start":107.887,"stop":126.24,"duration":18.35},{"text":"They entered into a

Houston.","start":259.314,"stop":270.456,"duration":11.14},{"text":"At the hearing on the Board case, certain evidence was introduced which we think was mostly important in this case and which brings about our first point which lies under Universal Camera case but let me tell the Court first what occurred.","start":270.456,"stop":292.122,"duration":21.67},{"text":"The current examiner held that the refusal to handle the products of Techalloy and Thorpe, the two nonunion off jobsites suppliers was unlawful because the exemption of Section 8 (e) applied only to be worked -- to work to be done at the jobsite, and not the materials manufactured off the jobsite and ship there for installation.","start":292.122,"stop":314.288,"duration":22.17},{"text":"He said also, even if this work and the application of the products had been jobsite construction work, they refuse to handle these products was unlawful under Sand Door.","start":314.288,"stop":328.539,"duration":14.25},{"text":"So he held that the International Union was not involved in this proceeding.","start":328.539,"stop":336.092,"duration":7.55},{"text":"The Board then reviewed this decision and held that the strike in each case was for work preservation.","start":336.092,"stop":344.476,"duration":8.38},{"text":"And thus, the strikes were primary and not unlawful.","start":344.476,"stop":349.347,"duration":4.87},{"text":"It did not deal with the implications of Section 8 (e) in this case and the court below speciically pointed that fact up.","start":349.347,"stop":358.392,"duration":9.05},{"text":"So when we went to the court below, the Court agreed with the Board that the activity of Local 22, that was the Local with which there was a contract, was not unlawful because it engaged in work preservation.","start":358.392,"stop":378.912,"duration":20.52},{"text":"It held that Local 113, that's the one at Corpus Christi, was not engaged in work preservation because it had no contract with the Association or Armstrong, and held that it was guilty of an 8 (b) (4) violation because it got an innocent third party.","start":378.912,"stop":398.488,"duration":19.58},{"text":"And that's Thorpe who manufactured the pre-mitered fittings involved in a labor dispute not of its own making.","start":398.488,"stop":407.396,"duration":8.91},{"text":"Now, we believe that this entire case is dependent to quite an extent on certain testimony that was given by an International vice president of the union who is also the Secretary of Local 22.","start":407.396,"stop":428.28,"duration":20.88},{"text":"His name is Baker.","start":428.28,"stop":430.553,"duration":2.27},{"text":"The International's attorney called him and put him on their stand as their witness.","start":430.553,"stop":436.804,"duration":6.25},{"text":"And here was the questions in this very brief by Mr. (Inaudible), the attorney.","start":436.804,"stop":440.943,"duration":4.14},{"text":"“Has your local instructed its members not to use the products of Thorpe?”","start":440.943,"stop":445.129,"duration":4.19},{"text":"The answer is “yes”.","start":445.129,"stop":446.468,"duration":1.34},{"text":"“Alright.","start":446.468,"stop":447.055,"duration":0.59},{"text":"Under all

“Alright!","start":456.73,"stop":458.605,"duration":1.88},{"text":"And why have you instructed your local members to take those positions?”","start":458.605,"stop":463.689,"duration":5.08},{"text":"Answer, “We are not in agreement with Thorpe or Techalloy”.","start":463.689,"stop":468.025,"duration":4.34},{"text":"Now his attorneys sensing that this was a bad statement interposed and said, “Well perhaps you misunderstood my question, Mr. Baker.","start":468.025,"stop":476.42,"duration":8.4},{"text":"Let me rephrase it,” but the trial examiner interrupted and said, “You mean because you have no contract with them?”","start":476.42,"stop":485.838,"duration":9.42},{"text":"Answer, “No contract, no.”","start":485.838,"stop":488.632,"duration":2.79},{"text":"Now it's true that this same witness later stated that it would be a violation of the contract to apply these materials but I say this is what Mr. Manoli was talking about.","start":488.632,"stop":502.801,"duration":14.17},{"text":"Who's going to pick what unlawful object is the dominant unlawful object?","start":502.801,"stop":509.827,"duration":7.03},{"text":"There wasn't any dispute that we know of with these people.","start":509.827,"stop":515.073,"duration":5.25},{"text":"The off jobsite, nonunion suppliers which we think are covered by Section 8 (e).","start":515.073,"stop":523.042,"duration":7.97},{"text":"At least it wasn't an active dispute but that isn't required under Sand Door or the other cases.","start":523.042,"stop":529.56,"duration":6.52},{"text":"As we view this case, Denver Building Trades really controls the question of what's the dominant, what's the non-dominant purpose?","start":529.56,"stop":538.521,"duration":8.96},{"text":"In that case, this Court held that if there was one unlawful object, the entire strike was taken.","start":538.521,"stop":544.786,"duration":6.26},{"text":"And we think that's the case here.","start":544.786,"stop":547.096,"duration":2.31},{"text":"Now the Fifth Circuit considered this matter and the general counsel was hard put to explain away this testimony.","start":547.096,"stop":558.802,"duration":11.71},{"text":"I suspect because for the first time in their brief to the Court of Appeals, they said Mr. Baker's testimony was confused.","start":558.802,"stop":566.55,"duration":7.75},{"text":"Well Mr. Baker never said it was confused.","start":566.55,"stop":568.704,"duration":2.15},{"text":"He never said he misunderstood the question.","start":568.704,"stop":571.338,"duration":2.63},{"text":"He never said that his answer was wrong.","start":571.338,"stop":574.619,"duration":3.28},{"text":"He didn't deny this at all.","start":574.619,"stop":577.134,"duration":2.51},{"text":"We think that is evidence of a motive which this Court should have considered below.","start":577.134,"stop":584.259,"duration":7.13},{"text":"Now the Board suggests and they think from the text of Universal Camera, that part where this Court was admonishing the Courts of Appeals of the requirement for canvassing the record as a whole.","start":584.259,"stop":598.102,"duration":13.84},{"text":"They took that part to court, it said the Court may not displace the Board's view between two fairly conflicting views even though the Court would justifiably have made a different choice, had the matter been before de
