introduction to our main brief and in our reply brief to explain why we think that this case in it's present posture at least insofar as it affects those first two counts, the finished cosmetic product and the diluents is particularly premature and entirely hypothetical.","start":584.201,"stop":601.734,"duration":17.53},{"text":"Now I'll try to summarize that position as briefly as I can.","start":601.734,"stop":605.498,"duration":3.76},{"text":"It appears to be agreed and I don't think there can be any question whatsoever that under the 1960 amendment the Color Additive Amendment of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act Congress intended that the Food and Drug Administration apply a safety in use standard under which it was, the administration was to determine before listing a color additive not whether that color additive in the abstract and just taken purely by itself was safe, but whether as used in a finished cosmetic or in any finished product whether that color ingredient was safe.","start":605.498,"stop":641.835,"duration":36.34},{"text":"Consequently, the practical result of that, the administration of that kind of a test is that an applicant for listing doesn't satisfy his burden under the statute by merely testing the coloring if the color ingredient as such, just that pigment.","start":641.835,"stop":661.058,"duration":19.22},{"text":"He has to submit to the commissioner information on how he will use the coloring ingredient and sufficient scientific data, pre-testing if you will as to the other ingredients that will be included with the pigment or the dye and the finished product.","start":661.058,"stop":678.287,"duration":17.23},{"text":"In other words the Food and Drug Administration cannot be expected in administering a safety in use standard to list color x as safe for use in a finished product unless it has adequate information that the finished product and the ingredients that are added to the color, the color pigment or dye are safe for use, but was that true that an entirely, a pigment or dye that may appear to safe in the abstract when combined with other products or when put in a finished product may not be safe, be safe for listing, then obviously the Commissioner of Food and Drug, the Food and Drug Administration, when it finally lists color x for safe in use in a certain finished product is in effect listing the finished product as well as the coloring ingredient and that's the kind of thing which becomes obvious we submit once the total system as administrated by the Food and Drug Administration goes into effect.","start":678.287,"stop":742.925,"duration":64.64},{"text":"If the company in this case were to submit adequate information under a safety in use standard even under their own construction of what color additive meant and if the Food and Drug Administration would then define that those pigments, those coloring ingredients as used in a finished product are safe and are listable in effect and will be listed then the controversy is over, they haven't been hurt at all.","start":742.925,"stop":770.841,"duration":27.92},{"text":"Their finished product will be listed, their coloring ingredient will be listed, and their diluents will be listed.","start":770.841,"stop":775.236,"duration":4.39}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"I thought their point was that you have jurisdiction to list or not list or control or have anything to say about their finished product as such, as such.","start":775.236,"stop":785.235,"duration":10}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"Well, we think, we submit that and I don't think they really disputed is that we have jurisdiction or the Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction to control a finished product although not as such if it had no color ingredients, but does have jurisdiction to control it as a terminal use of a coloring ingredient.","start":785.235,"stop":806.143,"duration":20.91},{"text":"Well, that make that is precisely what makes the suit, that's in first account disappear everything because if we do have jurisdiction to make that determination then they are not they are very likely not to be hurt at all once the whole machinery has been carried through and that, it seem to me indicates to us what the harms are or it's illustrative of the harms of premature judicial intervention.","start":806.143,"stop":834.493,"duration":28.35}]},{"speakerName":"Abe Fortas","textObjs":[{"text":"Diluent, diluent, how do you pronounce it.","start":834.493,"stop":836.273,"duration":1.78}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"The diluents, we think that's true with the diluents too.","start":836.273,"stop":838.864,"duration":2.59},{"text":"Assuming you take a color ingredient that is totally harmless in and of itself.","start":838.864,"stop":843.431,"duration":4.57},{"text":"If it's combined with any other product in which it appears in a finished cosmetic product produces a poisonous result because the diluent is poisonous, obviously the commissioner can't be expected to list the coloring ingredient as permissible for use with that diluent and the statute itself makes entirely clear that the listings are supposed to, are supposed to list the color ingredients for use with or without certain diluents.","start":843.431,"stop":869.152,"duration":25.72},{"text":"Now if that's true and the commissioner is supposed to specify the diluents with which pigment x can be mixed, well then he is got to pay us on whether these diluents are safe.","start":869.152,"stop":878.85,"duration":9.7},{"text":"And if he's got, the way he passes on that is he asks the requires of this company to make tests on the diluents to submit the results of those tests and to have the Food and Drug Administration pass upon.","start":878.85,"stop":891.374,"duration":12.52},{"text":"So that although this astute at the present they look like a challenge to the Food and Drug Administration regulation.","start":891.374,"stop":900.605,"duration":9.23},{"text":"If in fact we waited until the companies actually felt any kind of pinch at all, I think it will be discovered that they feel none.","start":900.605,"stop":907.864,"duration":7.26},{"text":"Now they --","start":907.864,"stop":909.104,"duration":1.24}]},{"speakerName":"Abe

inseparably.","start":909.104,"stop":919.324,"duration":10.22}]},{"speakerName":"Nathan Lewin","textObjs":[{"text":"The commissioner Mr. Justice Fortas I don't has ever said that and from what I am understand the need Food and Drug Administration takes no such position.","start":919.324,"stop":928.076,"duration":8.75},{"text":"It's position is that you can list product either let's say lipstick, ether under a common base, under a common color ingredient, you can list it together with certain diluents, list the diluents separately, but they had nothing, they had nothing in the statute and had nothing in the Food and Drug Administration of these provisions which would require them to list these separately and that we think also explores the exaggerated costs claim, their (Inaudible) estimates because one affidavit in the record and that also appear in the brief of the companies in this case, adds to the costs of complying with this because of the listing and testing provisions.","start":928.076,"stop":975.555,"duration":47.48},{"text":"Well, the listing there is a listing deposit under the regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration of $2600 per petition for listing, but that's a deposit only, that's to deprive the processing cost of the Food and Drug Administration and passing on the petition.","start":975.555,"stop":997.239,"duration":21.68},{"text":"Now not with -- the Food and Drug Administration is not going to be listing or incurring this $2600 cost with each one of a lipsticks of any particular plaintiff's obviously they can list them all together under one paragraph of the Code of Federal Regulation and the total cost will not even remotely approach what the plaintiffs in this case contend.","start":997.239,"stop":1022.021,"duration":24.78},{"text":"And say things true with the pre-testing, sure they would have to be testing of the finished product and of the diluents, but there are so many common ingredients among all these, I mean the plaintiffs referred to one company's 2700 cosmetic formulae, but there are so many common ingredients let's say among all of these lipsticks that it fallacious to just simply multiply them all and say that gives you the total cost of the complying with the Food and Drug Administration regulation.","start":1022.021,"stop":1050.115,"duration":28.09}]},{"speakerName":"Potter Stewart","textObjs":[{"text":"Do you think this case then is quite different from one we just heard,
