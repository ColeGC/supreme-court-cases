adverse.","start":48.134,"stop":53.323,"duration":5.19},{"text":"Thereupon, petitioner brought a Tucker Act suit in the District Court below.","start":53.323,"stop":59.173,"duration":5.85},{"text":"We are concerned solely with the statute of limitations which in this case bars the action unless filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.","start":59.173,"stop":72.185,"duration":13.01},{"text":"The District Court action was filed more than six years after the final contract delivery date although at the time involved in the administrative proceeding be excluded, the action was filed within a secured period.","start":72.185,"stop":87.424,"duration":15.24},{"text":"The ASPCA decision was filed six years four-and-a-half months after the final contract delivery date although the contract claim was made more than a year prior to the final contract delivery date.","start":87.424,"stop":101.632,"duration":14.21},{"text":"Now there are three issues involved.","start":101.632,"stop":103.535,"duration":1.9},{"text":"First is whether the contractor, while the contract administrative proceeding is pending, must bring a protective suit in order to stay the running of the statute.","start":103.535,"stop":114.95,"duration":11.42},{"text":"Second, is the statute extended to the date of the Board's decision so that it does not start to run until that time or that date?","start":114.95,"stop":125.286,"duration":10.34},{"text":"And third, is the statute tolled during the time of the contractor's claim is pending in the contract administrative proceeding.","start":125.286,"stop":134.586,"duration":9.3},{"text":"To change this article under which the claim arose provided for resolution of any dispute by the disputes article which in turn provided for decision by the contracting officer with appeal to the Secretary whose decision on that of his representative was final and conclusive.","start":134.586,"stop":154.032,"duration":19.45},{"text":"The disputes article proceeding was mandatory.","start":154.032,"stop":158.071,"duration":4.04},{"text":"Now, the implied contract which petitioner had was for canteen covers and it provided that the dyed felt therefore should contain a minimum amount of mildew inhibitor and be tested.","start":158.071,"stop":172.695,"duration":14.62},{"text":"The respondent, after testing it, rejected the felt, were not containing the required amount of inhibitor without disclosing the test that it made.","start":172.695,"stop":182.582,"duration":9.89},{"text":"Now the petitioners' deliveries were delayed some three months odd and its manufacturing cost increase by these rejections.","start":182.582,"stop":191.423,"duration":8.84},{"text":"Then the canteen covers were accepted upon the making of a downward price adjustment similarly under the changes article.","start":191.423,"stop":198.522,"duration":7.1},{"text":"Now much later but well within the six-year period after final delivery, the petitioner discovered that the respondent had rejected the dyed felt by the use of a colorimetric test which was not provided by the contract and which we contend was not accurate as the dyed felt.","start":198.522,"stop":218.363,"duration":19.84},{"text":"Now the petitioner requested the contracting officer to make an equitable upward price adjustment and from his denial took an appeal and upon the adverse decision the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals brought this Tucker Act suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York.","start":218.363,"stop":237.119,"duration":18.76},{"text":"Now the District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations ruling that the statutes started to run on the date of the final contract deliveries.","start":237.119,"stop":248.154,"duration":11.03},{"text":"Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and that Court on the division affirmed the judgment.","start":248.154,"stop":257.41,"duration":9.26},{"text":"Now, the three issues involved as I said are staying, extending or tolling the statute of limitations.","start":257.41,"stop":265.124,"duration":7.71},{"text":"Now, this urge to their protective suit must be instituted to stay the running of the statute while the administrative remedy is being pursued.","start":265.124,"stop":275.015,"duration":9.89},{"text":"If the protective suit be the rule and many lawyers would advise their clients to file actions in the District Courts or in the Court of Claims at the time that the administrative proceeding under the disputes article has instituted.","start":275.015,"stop":289.818,"duration":14.8},{"text":"Now the defendant -- now the respondent in his brief has referred to an article by Mr. Spector, the Chairman on Board of Appeals.","start":289.818,"stop":300.923,"duration":11.11},{"text":"That's on page 34, the respondent's brief.","start":300.923,"stop":304.613,"duration":3.69},{"text":"Now on page 284, Mr. Spector's article has noted there are 11,856 appeals redacted by the ASPCA and the predecessors and that only 467 were filed in court.","start":304.613,"stop":321.789,"duration":17.18},{"text":"Now had the rule of protective suit been required then instead of 467 suits, it might have been 11,856 suits.","start":321.789,"stop":332.366,"duration":10.58},{"text":"Now we submit that the dockets of the Courts are too crowded for Congress to have intended that suit must be brought by the contracting officer and the Board of Appeals are engaged in ascertaining the facts which will determine whether the Government will pay the claim.","start":332.366,"stop":350.834,"duration":18.47},{"text":"Now many worthy claims wouldn't be defeated in the cases of claimants unaware of the need for bringing such effective actions and many courts wouldn't dismiss a protective suit as premature and probably any Assistant United States' Attorney would so urge.","start":350.834,"stop":367.607,"duration":16.77},{"text":"So we submit that a protective suit is not required.","start":367.607,"stop":371.091,"duration":3.48},{"text":"The next we submit that a -- the statute is extended by the contract disputes article and proceeding does not begin to run until the final administrative decision.","start":371.091,"stop":382.613,"duration":11.52},{"text":"I might say that after the Court of Appeals' decision was rendered in this case which was in June of 1966 and the Court of Claims rendered a Nager Electric decision in October 1966 which is reported at 368 F.2d 847 and that's Mr. Judge -- Judge Davis' opinion and which supports this point of our argument.","start":382.613,"stop":416.949,"duration":34.34},{"text":"A contractor's claim for equitable price adjustment comes within the disputes article since it is compensable under the changes article and the contractor may not bring a Tucker Act suit until he has exhausted the administrative remedies provided by the contract and should he sue without exhausting such remedies is suitably dismissed.","start":416.949,"stop":440.628,"duration":23.68},{"text":"Now under the Wunderlich Act of 9/11/1954, no suit can be instituted unless the contractor can say that the final administrative decision is subject to judicial reversal because it's arbitrary, it's capricious, fraudulent, in bad faith, not supported by substantial evidence or erroneous in law.","start":440.628,"stop":461.956,"duration":21.33},{"text":"Now it cannot in this suit of any of those things until the administrative decision is rendered.","start":461.956,"stop":468.476,"duration":6.52},{"text":"He must secure the decision before he can attack it.","start":468.476,"stop":472.22,"duration":3.74},{"text":"And the District Courts and the Court of Claims are limited to a review of the administrative record and may not take evidence de novo.","start":472.22,"stop":479.793,"duration":7.57},{"text":"Now in any matter, required to be submitted to the Board of Appeals, a contractor has bound himself to the administrative course and he has agreed to convert a breach of contract claim to one of relief under the contract.","start":479.793,"stop":494.789,"duration":15},{"text":"The claims under the changes, Changed Conditions or Delays-Damages articles, the contractor must file a claim with the contracting officer and that the decision being adverse, he must appeal to the Board of Appeals then he can't ask the United States to pay any amounts on account of his claim until the Board of Appeals files a decision.","start":494.789,"stop":515.666,"duration":20.88},{"text":"He can't sue in Court until he has a right to demand payment.We submit that that is when the right of action first accrued.","start":515.666,"stop":523.044,"duration":7.38},{"text":"Now limitation statutes aren't designed to promote justice by preventing surprise and revival of claims but have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost or memories have faded and witnesses have disappeared.","start":523.044,"stop":536.516,"duration":13.47},{"text":"Now in contract administrative proceedings, cases claims are promptly made, evidence is presented, memories are threshed and witnesses appear and testify.","start":536.516,"stop":547.415,"duration":10.9},{"text":"The reason for the statute of limitations we submit is not present in these cases.Now in the United States Steel decision of the Court of Claims which is cited by the respondent on page 21 of its brief, Judge Davis writing for the Court of Claims said that the delay, the 1946 to 1958 in the Board proceeding there, that there is no claim or reason to believe that the Government evidence or records which would have been introduced before the Board were lost, destroyed, unavailable or grew stale.","start":547.415,"stop":581.238,"duration":33.82},{"text":"Judge Davis said that the record did not show the reasons for the delay or who was at fault, that the parties attempted to cast the blame on each other but that the Court could not tell which side was right and that in any event, the Court felt that the Government was in no position to complain of delay since it had allowed the proceedings to remain dormant for over 10 years.","start":581.238,"stop":606.33,"duration":25.09},{"text":"Now there's no
