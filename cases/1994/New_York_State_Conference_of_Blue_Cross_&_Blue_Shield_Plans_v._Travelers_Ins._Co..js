Iselin","textObjs":[{"text":"--No, Your Honor, because what we have here for HMO's is the Federal HMO Act, and the Federal HMO Act on many of these issues acts as a sort of HMO savings clause because it specifically authorized States to conduct regulation of HMO's in many aspects similar to what we talked about earlier, community rating being one very good example.","start":3306.124,"stop":3327.656,"duration":21.53},{"text":"Now, that act was passed just 1 year before ERISA, and I think when you read the two together, the Federal HMO Act preserves for the States actually a fairly high level of regulation of HMO's, but it does not preserve differing assessments on what HMO's pay, thereby interfering with employee benefit plans.","start":3327.656,"stop":3348.569,"duration":20.91},{"text":"There are four specific ways that the 9-percent also very directly interferes with the choice, and since my time is running short, I'd like to talk about one in particular, and one result, when you increase costs in this way and it gets passed through from the HMO to employee benefit plans, is not just that the plans pay more, but they also can restructure benefits, increase copayments and, particularly important, sometimes plans drop coverage altogether.","start":3348.569,"stop":3375.887,"duration":27.32},{"text":"This is particularly common with small businesses, who might be right at the margin of whether they even provide coverage.","start":3375.887,"stop":3382.208,"duration":6.32},{"text":"An HMO tends to be the lowest cost option in the market.","start":3382.208,"stop":3386.278,"duration":4.07},{"text":"Thus, when we think about the impact, it's not enough just to think about it as increasing costs, which it certainly does here, but also reducing benefits, which is very analogous to Met Life, and in fact causing some employee benefit plans to just say, we have no more money to pay this added cost.","start":3386.278,"stop":3404.74,"duration":18.46},{"text":"We can't increase our coinsurance or our copayments because they're at the maximum, we can't strip away any more benefits because we're at the minimum level of benefits that we can provide through the HMO.","start":3404.74,"stop":3415.279,"duration":10.54},{"text":"The only choice we have left now is to discontinue coverage.","start":3415.279,"stop":3419.083,"duration":3.8},{"text":"And one of the ironic things of the State's position is that at the same time that it's trying to increase coverage, and is arguing for that as a justification for these assessments, the actions may have the exact opposite effect, which is to price some employee benefit plans, and particularly those of small business, right out of the market.","start":3419.083,"stop":3439.413,"duration":20.33},{"text":"Finally, I'd like to touch briefly on the Metropolitan Life case, because as some have noted, it's directly analogous here, particularly on the compelling versus inducing point, and again, one of the options in Metropolitan Life, faced with having to pay for the mental health benefit at issue, was that plans had two choices.","start":3439.413,"stop":3461.827,"duration":22.41},{"text":"They could either move to self-insurance, which was directly recognized in that decision, or they could take this other option which I just described, which is to simply drop coverage.","start":3461.827,"stop":3472.3,"duration":10.47},{"text":"The law in Metropolitan Life, which the Court recognized related to employee benefit plans, was no more compulsory than the assessments at issue here.","start":3472.3,"stop":3483.775,"duration":11.47},{"text":"Plans still retained options, and they could have chosen to exercise those options, just as ERISA plans here may have some theoretical options.","start":3483.775,"stop":3493.881,"duration":10.11}]},{"speakerName":"William H.
