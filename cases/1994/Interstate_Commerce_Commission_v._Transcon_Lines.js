that could not prevail over a violation of the Commission's regulations, and in that way the case is very analogous to our case.","start":730.272,"stop":745.449,"duration":15.18},{"text":"But Commercial Metals held, in the context of an effort by the shipper not to pay the transportation charge at all, the transportation rate, that the shipper could not raise that as a defense, that if there's to be a challenge to it because of violation of the Commission's credit regulations, and that is the only case of this Court that deals with a claim of violation of the credit regulations, that is to be enforced in the courts by the ICC.","start":745.449,"stop":780.372,"duration":34.92},{"text":"The reason I think that an argument could be made by shippers that Commercial Metals doesn't extend as far as this case is because in this case what is sought to be collected is not the rate for transportation or services that the statute requires to be in a tariff as a rate filing.","start":780.372,"stop":805.655,"duration":25.28},{"text":"That rate is what would be payable in the transaction if the payment were made promptly, plus whatever interest there would be for

addition are these liquidated damages called collection expense charges authorized by the regulation beginning on page 83a, which are in the tariff, but not because the statute requiring the rates for transportation or services require it to be in the tariff... those statutes we've set forth in our brief on page 74a and 75a of the appendix to the petition... but instead it's because the regulation itself requires that those liquidated damage rates be in the tariff.","start":827.936,"stop":880.405,"duration":52.47},{"text":"They're entirely a creature of the regulation, and that is on 84a of the

\"","start":899.782,"stop":905.103,"duration":5.32},{"text":"Those requirements are creatures of the regulation, just as the authorization to collect these charges at all are creatures of the regulation, and the Commission, as I started to say at the outset, is acting in an area where Congress expressly relied on the Commission's regulations to set the rule.","start":905.103,"stop":929.968,"duration":24.87},{"text":"Congress proscribed altogether any credit transactions here except pursuant to regulations which the Commission may adopt, so the Commission was acting really at the zenith of its regulatory powers in fulfilling a mandate that Congress expressly relied on the Commission and only the Commission to fulfill here.","start":929.968,"stop":955.536,"duration":25.57},{"text":"So regardless of whether the shippers could raise a defense, what Commercial Metals looked to was an even more venerable provision of the act that dates back to the original Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, the statutory authority for the Commission to bring an enforcement action in Federal court, and the Court in Commercial Metals emphasized that that could be an injunctive action to enforce the credit regulations.","start":955.536,"stop":994.161,"duration":38.63},{"text":"It should be remembered that at the time of the Commercial Metals decision in 1982, the credit regulations did not yet authorize this liquidated damages for the cost of collection, and the only defense being made by the shipper was a defense not to have to pay the filed rate for transportation itself.","start":994.161,"stop":1025.096,"duration":30.94},{"text":"So there might have been anticipation that the Commission would be unlikely to bring an injunctive action which would say that the carrier should not be paid at all for the transportation, even in the circumstance where the carrier did not fully comply with the credit regulations, but at least as the Court interpreted the act, that was to be left to the Commission's enforcement authority rather than an equitable defense by the shippers.","start":1025.096,"stop":1063.388,"duration":38.29},{"text":"Well, since the conditions admittedly were not complied with for assessing the liquidated damages, it might seem obvious, in light of Commercial Metals and the Commission's enforcement authority in 49 U.S.C. 11702 that I've referred to, that the Commission's action to enjoin this belated effort of the trustee acting in perfect good faith to try to enhance the value of the estate, to enjoin this effort to collect liquidated damages when these very carefully constructed conditions had not been complied with to the obvious prejudice of the shippers whom the conditions were designed to protect, and that the trustee, standing in the shoes of Transcon, should be relegated to the historic remedy that existed from 1920 to 1988 of the transportation charge plus interest for any lateness in the payment, obviously a remedy that could not be said to be incompatible with the act.","start":1063.388,"stop":1153.981,"duration":90.59},{"text":"The court of appeals, however, said no, that that rather obvious conclusion should not be reached because of the filed rate doctrine as it understood that doctrine to have been applied by this Court in Maislin Industries v. Primary Steel.","start":1153.981,"stop":1177.93,"duration":23.95},{"text":"Now, we think that this was misconceived by the court of appeals from the outset, and the first thing to be said is that Maislin, in contrast to this case, involved an effort to enforce an unfiled rate, the negotiated rate which was never filed, but under the Commission's then negotiated rates policy was to be enforced in preference to the actual filed rate.","start":1177.93,"stop":1209.735,"duration":31.8},{"text":"And Maislin itself, in footnote 11 of the Maislin opinion, pointed out that the case was therefore different from prior decisions of the Court in which the question was which of two filed rates should be applied, rather than an effort to depart from the filed rate schedule altogether.","start":1209.735,"stop":1240.337,"duration":30.6},{"text":"And we think that that footnote applies a fortiori in this case, because here it's not a choice between two filed rates for transportation, it's a choice between the filed rate for transportation, which the Commission says the trustee is entitled to, and this other charge of liquidated damages that is not a filed rate for transportation within the meaning of the statutes that require rates for transportation and services to be provided, but as I previously explained is entirely a creature of the regulations which is required to be in the tariff only because the regulations require it to be in the tariff.","start":1240.337,"stop":1289.354,"duration":49.02},{"text":"That is the source of the obligation.","start":1289.354,"stop":1295.072,"duration":5.72},{"text":"Then this Court decided Reiter v. Cooper after the court of appeals' initial decision, which we thought made the error more manifest because Reiter established quite clearly the principle that Maislin did not mean that the filed rate doctrine would preclude claims and defenses that are specifically accorded by the act itself, such as the Commission's express statutory authority to bring an action for an injunction to enforce its credit regulations.","start":1295.072,"stop":1342.904,"duration":47.83},{"text":"So when we petitioned for certiorari for the first time in this case, we suggested that the judgment be vacated and the case remanded for reconsideration in light of Reiter v. Cooper, which is the course that the Court took, but on remand the court of appeals reached the same conclusion, basically holding that the ICC statutory enforcement authority should be subordinated to its view of the filed rate doctrine, which is--","start":1342.904,"stop":1384.065,"duration":41.16}]},{"speakerName":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","textObjs":[{"text":"Mr. Wallace, did that occur in the Ninth Circuit after reargument and fresh briefing, or when the response to Reiter--","start":1384.065,"stop":1393.671,"duration":9.61}]},{"speakerName":"Lawrence G.
