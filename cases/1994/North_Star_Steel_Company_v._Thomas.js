which have been alluded to in the earlier portions of the argument but that I think are especially crucial to the disposition of this case, and the first is that in determining whether the NLRA and the WARN act are analogous for purposes of limitations borrowing, the question is not whether the similarities between the statutes outnumber the dissimilarities, but as Mr. Gold has mentioned, the question is whether the statutes are similar with respect to those features which would be especially relevant to the choice of an appropriate limitations period.","start":2684.253,"stop":2716.665,"duration":32.41},{"text":"And then the second point I'd like to allude to is one that Justice Ginsburg

the filing of civil actions than is the 6-month period established by section 10(b), and I think that should lead the Court to conclude that there were some fairly unusual factors at work that led Congress to adopt the 10(b) limitations period, and the question is whether those factors are present in WARN act suits as well.","start":2732.276,"stop":2755.521,"duration":23.25},{"text":"And I think the two crucial factors are first, as Mr. Gold mentioned, section 10(b), the NLRA generally is particularly concerned not with labor law in general, but with the process of collective bargaining and private dispute resolution under the terms of a CBA, and I think the contrast between DelCostello and Reed is telling.","start":2755.521,"stop":2775.195,"duration":19.67},{"text":"This Court

dealing with an area in which some of the primary conduct prohibited by title I was also an unfair labor practice under the NLRA, but the Court said in Reed that because the case did not touch upon the formation of the collective bargaining agreements or the private resolution of disputes thereunder, borrowing of the 10(b) limitations period was inappropriate.","start":2788.232,"stop":2811.147,"duration":22.91},{"text":"I think the second point that's crucial in determining why 6 months is appropriate in the NLRA context is that the filing of an unfair labor practice charge requires simply the filing of a charge with an administrative body.","start":2811.147,"stop":2824.136,"duration":12.99},{"text":"The NLRB then takes responsibility for determining whether a complaint should be filed, and for prosecuting a complaint if one is pursued, and by contrast, a situation in which the responsibility is entirely upon the private litigant to file suit in Federal district court, the choice of such a short limitations period is less appropriate.","start":2824.136,"stop":2843.678,"duration":19.54},{"text":"We recognize from DelCostello that we can't make the argument that borrowing a limitations period established for a limitations charge is never appropriate for filing a suit in court, because DelCostello held that sometimes it was, but

months.","start":2863.753,"stop":2876.15,"duration":12.4},{"text":"Statutes, by contrast, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Portal-to-Portal pay act, which require a litigant to proceed by
